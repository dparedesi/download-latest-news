Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: PIXABAY Published Oct 10, 2025, 11:30 AM Updated Oct 10, 2025, 12:59 PM NEW YORK – In June, Mr Elon Musk predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) would become smarter than any human by the end of 2026. In July, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said his company’s product “is going to reshape the course of human history”. Mr Mark Zuckerberg has imagined creating “a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world”. The CEOs are backing up their words with dollars. Five of the biggest tech companies are together spending an estimated US$371 billion (S$482 billion) in 2025 on the massive data centres necessary to train and run complex AI models. That figure is expected to increase in the years to come: McKinsey & Co projects that data centres will require US$5.2 trillion in spending by 2030 to keep up with demand for AI. All that spending raises the question: Will AI ever produce enough revenue to justify the price? The maths is daunting. In 2025, AI technology is expected to generate US$60 billion in revenue, according to one estimate by writers Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren of AI-focused newsletter Exponential View. That number will need to increase dramatically if tech companies want to recoup costs. In September, Bain & Co calculated that Big Tech would need US$2 trillion in additional annual revenue to pay for data centre expenditures by 2030 and projected a shortfall of US$800 billion a year even under ideal circumstances. If AI giants and their investors can’t make their money back, then we’re talking about a historically large case of overbuilding and overinvestment. There might even be a word for that. “I believe it’s a bubble,” says Mr Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital Management, a self-described contrarian hedge fund with about US$300 million in assets under management. “Will there ever be a payback on this stuff? I think the answer is ‘highly unlikely’.” Covering the cost of just 2025’s build-out will require additional revenue of US$480 billion, according to Mr Kupperman’s calculations. Where that will come from is unclear, especially considering that for most users, ChatGPT is currently free. “If they charged you a couple dollars every time you queried ChatGPT, I don’t know if they’d have a market,” Mr Kupperman says. It doesn’t help that graphics processing units (GPUs) – the essential computer chips for AI that account for a significant chunk of data centre costs – depreciate quickly. In past bubbles, such as the railroad construction of the 19th century or the telecommunications build-out of the early 2000s, the overspending at least created lasting infrastructure. Even if people didn’t use the railroad tracks right away, they remained useful for decades, as was the fibre-optic cable laid in the 1990s. GPUs, in contrast, appear to have a shelf life of just a few years before they need to be reassigned to more basic AI tasks. The maths makes AI spending seem less like a flywheel than a hamster wheel. Then there are the bottlenecks, which could prevent many planned AI factories from reaching completion. While data centres typically take two to three years to build, hooking them up to an energy source can take up to eight years, according to Boston Consulting Group. So it will take that much longer for data centres to begin generating revenue. And that’s if the energy is available at all: A 2024 review by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the data centre capital of the world, concluded that meeting the unconstrained energy needs of this infrastructure would be “very difficult”, and even meeting half of that demand would be “difficult”. Sceptics also point to disappointing performance by the AI tools themselves. A much-cited study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab found that 95 per cent of AI projects piloted by businesses have produced no measurable return. McKinsey reported that almost eight in 10 companies that adopt generative AI see “no significant bottom-line impact”. OpenAI released GPT-5 in August to tepid reviews, raising questions about the industry’s assumption that more data is better when it comes to AI. Finally, observers concerned about an AI bubble point to the circularity of recent deals – for example, Nvidia is selling chips to OpenAI while also investing in it – that has echoes of the telecoms bubble. They also worry about the growing opacity of funding mechanisms. In August, Meta Platforms raised US$29 billion for data centres from private credit firms. Big start-ups such as OpenAI and CoreWeave have also leaned on private credit for data centre financing. These agreements often take the form of obscure special purpose vehicles, which keep the debt off the big companies’ balance sheets and make the health of the investments hard to track. There are also signs that the exposure of average investors to these risky bets is growing, as private credit firms raise money from insurance companies and real-estate-focused exchange-traded funds invest in data centres, according to investor and writer Paul Kedrosky. And of course anyone who owns shares in a mutual fund is most likely betting on data centres via Big Tech stocks. The AI bulls – which, judging by stock market trends, include most investors – aren’t too concerned. In their view, revenue from generative AI is growing and will continue to grow. And while the infrastructure build-out looks big, it’s not that big compared with certain past bubbles, write Mr Azhar and Mr Warren of Exponential View. As a proportion of gross domestic product, spending on railroads during that boom was four times greater than current spending on AI infrastructure. Most important, Big Tech companies have plenty of cash; they can afford to lose a few hundred billion dollars. Mr Altman and Mr Zuckerberg have both suggested they’re focused on the long game rather than immediate profits. The question is how long their investors will take the same view. The challenge of any bubble is not knowing if it will pop but when. Entrepreneurial studies clinical assistant professor Erik Gordon of the University of Michigan says the first signs of fading optimism are likely to appear in venture capital funding for AI start-ups. “You might see the size of funding rounds go down,” he says. Public stock prices would most likely follow. (For now, it’s still up, up, up.) Until then, the AI explosion is something of a Rorschach test: What you see depends on how you view AI’s prospects broadly. Haters have been calling the boom financially unsustainable for ages. Those who believe in the technology’s potential seem to have faith that it will still grow and improve fast enough to recoup costs – even if the traditional laws of the market suggest otherwise.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2025 4:36:21 PM PDT by CFW Since it filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 29, auto-parts supplier First Brands has come under intense scrutiny for alleged accounting malpractice, opaque financing agreements, and late payments to suppliers. In an effort to shed light into the company’s murky finances, one of First Brands’ largest creditors filed an emergency motion in bankruptcy court on Wednesday calling for an independent investigation into the beleaguered firm’s books. As much as $2.3 billion in short-term financing has “simply vanished,” wrote Richard Jacobsen, counsel for Raistone, a fund that is partly owned by O’Connor, a UBS hedge fund. Raistone said it was owed at least $172 million. The Department of Justice also opened an inquiry into the collapse, The Financial Times reported on Thursday. For years, First Brands had received funding through a short-term lending strategy known as “factoring.” After the supplier delivered products to customers including Walmart and O’Reilly Autoparts, it sold the right to the customer invoices to outside investors, including units of UBS and Jefferies. The arrangement allowed First Brands to receive cash upfront, smoothing its inflows, while giving lenders the opportunity to earn interest. Factoring, part of a broader credit strategy known as trade financing, isn’t unusual. Yet First Brands allegedly borrowed billions of dollars of the short-term loans, with much of the money kept off-balance sheet through a network of separate corporate entities. It may also have sold certain invoices more than once, according to court filings and transcripts. [snip] When asked in court on Oct. 1 where roughly $2 billion of factoring cash was located, Sunny Singh, a lawyer for First Brands, said: “It’s not here. We don’t have it. Zero dollars. There’s $12 million in the bank account today. That’s it. There’s nothing else.” (Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...

Now, Their Losses Are Adding Up.” “Chu’s Tricolor Auto Group had recently opened a 258,000-square-foot maintenance center outside Phoenix to repair and recondition the used vehicles it sold to its core market of Spanish-speaking immigrants. The facility—its second, after one in Texas—was to anchor a western-state expansion. Rating firms had just graded Tricolor’s latest round of securities backed by its auto loans, pushing the total volume of its rated bonds past $2 billion. S&P Global Ratings gave the biggest slice of the security an AA rating, its second-highest ranking. Previous baskets of Tricolor auto loans were bought by Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase, Pimco, and AllianceBernstein. Among Tricolor’s backers was BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which had cast the chain’s focus on the Hispanic community as consistent with its social-investing goals. JPMorgan and Barclays had provided the company with a line of credit. “We have conviction that our differentiated approach enables us to deliver consistent, predictable and positive outcomes,” Chu said in a June 11 statement announcing the Barclays-led securitization. Less than three months later, his auto empire lay in shambles. On Sept. 5, Tricolor abruptly closed its 65 lots across six states before filing for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. S&P put its auto-loan-backed securities on watch for downgrades before suspending its ratings entirely, and some of the company’s lenders have flagged their exposure in regulatory filings. As Tricolor benefited from Wall Street’s largess, U.S. banks and ratings firms appear to have missed or overlooked warning signs.

For years, First Brands had received funding through a short-term lending strategy known as “factoring.” After the supplier delivered products to customers including Walmart and O’Reilly Autoparts, it sold the right to the customer invoices to outside investors, including units of UBS and Jefferies. The arrangement allowed First Brands to receive cash upfront, smoothing its inflows, while giving lenders the opportunity to earn interest. Factoring, part of a broader credit strategy known as trade financing, isn’t unusual. Yet First Brands allegedly borrowed billions of dollars of the short-term loans, with much of the money kept off-balance sheet through a network of separate corporate entities. It may also have sold certain invoices more than once, according to court filings and transcripts. [snip] When asked in court on Oct. 1 where roughly $2 billion of factoring cash was located, Sunny Singh, a lawyer for First Brands, said: “It’s not here. We don’t have it. Zero dollars. There’s $12 million in the bank account today. That’s it. There’s nothing else.” (Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...

The facility—its second, after one in Texas—was to anchor a western-state expansion. Rating firms had just graded Tricolor’s latest round of securities backed by its auto loans, pushing the total volume of its rated bonds past $2 billion. S&P Global Ratings gave the biggest slice of the security an AA rating, its second-highest ranking. Previous baskets of Tricolor auto loans were bought by Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase, Pimco, and AllianceBernstein. Among Tricolor’s backers was BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which had cast the chain’s focus on the Hispanic community as consistent with its social-investing goals. JPMorgan and Barclays had provided the company with a line of credit. “We have conviction that our differentiated approach enables us to deliver consistent, predictable and positive outcomes,” Chu said in a June 11 statement announcing the Barclays-led securitization. Less than three months later, his auto empire lay in shambles. On Sept. 5, Tricolor abruptly closed its 65 lots across six states before filing for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. S&P put its auto-loan-backed securities on watch for downgrades before suspending its ratings entirely, and some of the company’s lenders have flagged their exposure in regulatory filings. As Tricolor benefited from Wall Street’s largess, U.S. banks and ratings firms appear to have missed or overlooked warning signs.

Title: Why The Bull Market Should Keep Going

ByLarry Light, Senior Contributor. Will the good times for stocks stay rolling? Likely, yes, in the face of some daunting obstacles. A year ago, this column predicted that stocks probably would continue their winning ways in 2025. Up to now, that upbeat prognosis has held true, with equities powering past a Washington-induced April chill. The U.S. is completing the third year of a bull run, with the S&P 500 climbing almost 90%. (FactSet Research dates the start of the bull market at Oct. 12, 2022.) Of course, no one knows whether some X factor will appear to halt positive market momentum and shove investments into a hole. Recall last April, when President Donald Trump first announced his planned tariffs—and investors freaked out. The heartening news is that stocks recovered their equilibrium from that presidential pronouncement and then some. This has been the story of 2025, and with luck stocks will keep up their welcome performance. Factors benefiting stocks include a relatively low inflation rate, a decent (if not roaring) economy and artificial intelligence’s popularity. The S&P 500 this year is up 14.5% through Thursday, having shaken off the April panic, as the tariffs thus far appear not to have harmed growth, or if so, just marginally. A poll of registered investment advisors (RIAs) this summer found cautious optimism, with almost two-thirds of respondents expecting the S&P to rise 6% to 9% over the ensuing 12 months. The poll, by advisory firm Security Benefit (with data from Greenwald Research), found scant RIA expectations for a near-term recession. “We’re in the middle innings of the bull market,” says Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America, in an interview. He points to strong stock buybacks and high-income consumer spending as propellants for the equities surge. Indeed, stockholders have spent over $1 trillion on share repurchases over the past 12 months through September, per Morningstar, and consumer spending is healthy, although more so for wealthier Americans, a BofA study found. Certainly, some have worried about whether inflation will rise meaningfully, especially as the tariffs take hold. The Federal Reserve has an annual 2% target for inflation, but that has proven elusive. Thus far, the Consumer Price Index has stayed just below 3% annually (the next CPI release, covering September, is on Oct. 15, if the shutdown doesn’t thwart it). A survey by the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed that households believe inflation will tick up slightly above 3% over the next year, hardly a baleful scenario. Up ahead, macroeconomic conditions appear favorable, on balance. Macro, after all, typically drives the market. The Fed believes that gross domestic product will maintain a steady, modestly improving pace going forward, clocking a median annual increase of 1.6% this year, 1.8% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. You’d think that the U.S. government shutdown would kneecap stocks. But as Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, points out in a research note, the market has tended to “drift higher” in previous Washington closures. The thinking apparently is that no lasting damage will occur and the stoppage will be temporary. To date, the market has largely shrugged off the shutdown: The S&P climbed 0.58% on Wednesday and Thursday closed down 0.34%. Overall, since the shutdown started, the index has inched up 0.62%. One big reason for optimism about the market: Lower interest rates soon are a strong possibility. Recently released minutes of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking board in mid-September indicated that the Fed is tilted toward two more cuts this year, one-quarter percentage point each. In that same meeting, the central bank moved to slice its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to a 4.0% to 4.25% range, its first reduction of 2025. The most-discussed catalyst behind much of the market growth lately is artificial intelligence. The widespread fascination with AI’s promise has been stoked by a massive buildout of data centers. Meta Platforms and Oracle are among the tech giants pouring vast sums into this arena. The gargantuan capital spending has doubled GDP this year, by some estimates. Meta’s stock is up 25% in 2025 and Oracle’s 79%. A large question looms about whether all these outlays will pay off, and skeptics declare that the enthusiasm is reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com boom, which ended badly. Profits from AI are hard to find, as of yet. Still, the craze over the dot-com industry was not wrong, just early. Since that bust, a third of a century ago, the Web has gone on to dominate the world’s culture and commerce. Long-term investors should take heed. In the meantime, stocks should remain rewarding for investors. Nobody knows for how long, but the immediate future looks pretty good.

Title: Stocks Fell Today. Costco's Shares Rose. Here's Why.

Costco stock got a lift on a day when U.S. indexes fell. Strong September sales numbers helped. Shares of the warehouse retail giant finished Thursday up some 3% to almost $943. The move was helped by September retail sales that rose 5% year-over-year to near $26.6 billion. Investors may have read the news as an encouraging sign about the start to the holiday season, though it's worth noting that September's sales are part of a just-begun fiscal quarter that will be reported in full this December. Investors might've expected a slowdown in September sales growth as bad news for Costco, but the stock rose today. That's at least in part due to the fact that there were reasons for unusually high demand in the year-ago month, and investors took that into account in their evaluation of the latest report. Costco's (COST) September sales rose 9% in 2024, but investors didn't perceive that slowdown as a bad thing. The company, UBS analysts wrote, "had a tougher comparison from last year when the retailer benefited from a rise in demand as consumers spent around Hurricane Helene and ahead of port strikes." Extended store hours have been seen as giving sales a lift lately. Shares of Costco have had a bumpy 2025; through Thursday's close, they're up roughly 3% year-to-date. Wall Street analysts are mostly bullish, with Visible Alpha's mean price target at $1,065, about 13% above Thursday's close. Costco said global same-store sales rose 5.7%; it also introduced a new metric, “digitally-enabled” comparable sales, which includes all sales to members that started through a digital device. That number, the company said, rose more than 26%. "We see these results as yet another strong showing," UBS wrote.

Title: Dem Influencer Who Called Trump ‘Dementia-Addled’ Cheers Violent Rioters at BlackRock

Full Content:
Jack Cocchiarella, a Democrat social media influencer with over 1.25 million YouTube subscribers who recently appeared on CNN and interviewed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, expressed support on social media for protesters involved in an unruly demonstration at BlackRock headquarters. Cocchiarella posted on X, “Fuck BlackRock free Palestine it’s that simple,” in response to footage of violent pro-Hamas rioters attempting to storm BlackRock headquarters in New York City. Cocchiarella, known for his political commentary, appeared on CNN last week, where he described President Donald Trump as “kind of this dementia-addled, really nursing home patient in the White House right now.” During the same exchange, Cocchiarella criticized Trump’s approach to policy negotiations, claiming the president “doesn’t seem interested in negotiating” and instead uses his time “to go out to golf” or “maybe remodel some more parts of the White House,” taking pleasure in “the traumatizing of federal workers.” Cocchiarella’s claims fall short on the facts. Just six months into his second term, President Trump brokered roughly one peace deal or ceasefire per month, a level of achievement the president Cocchiarella supports could not match in four years. In September 2024, RNC Research reported that President Joe Biden had “spent a total of 532 days (40.3% of his presidency) on vacation.” Cocchiarella conducted an interview with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) in August, where the two discussed national politics and the Republican Party’s future leadership. Cocchiarella said: We talk a lot in our party right now about rebranding. We need to fix the brand of the Democratic Party. We do. But I think in this moment, we also have to focus on the brand of the Republican Party. These people don’t want lower taxes, more freedoms. JD Vance doesn’t care about that. JD Vance wants to take his lifestyle and impose it on you and then not live it himself. This guy’s a squish. He’s weak. He’s desperate for power. Newsom responded by warning “This is not just about Trump. This is about something much more insidious, much more alarming,” urging viewers to “pay attention” to figures like JD Vance and Stephen Miller, “The folks around Trump and those that are perpetuating, promoting Trumpism, and sometimes to your point, running circles around Trump in many respects.” He added, “JD Vance is a unique one, because he’s complete weakness masquerading as strength.” Cocchiarella’s admiration for Newsom contrasted sharply with the governor’s own record. Gavin Newsom spent $250 million on a special election to gerrymander California’s congressional map while blaming Donald Trump for a lack of wildfire aid, even as displaced residents waited for relief. Newsom called a November 4 special election under the “Election Rigging Response Act” to eliminate Republican seats in Congress, claiming he was “saving democracy” despite questions over the law’s constitutionality. Despite boasting that California’s economy rivals Japan’s, Newsom presides over surging homelessness, rising poverty, and a $68 billion budget deficit that indicate widespread mismanagement within his administration. These examples are far from exhaustive. The California governor praised Cocchiarella’s growing online platform, saying, “Let’s see the growth of your podcast, bro, what you’re doing with this YouTube channel. It’s like blowing up. That just gives you hope, and it inspires other people.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Says Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Is Dead, Predicts Lower Price Spikes And Dips

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has theorized that the concept of a four-year cycle for Bitcoin is fading away after holding sway for nearly 13 years. Hoskinson noted that financial heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity wading into BTC will reduce the volatility typically associated with the asset. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle will no longer hold sway in the coming years, given the entry of new players into the space. According to Hoskinson, new institutional money and complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will be the death of the four-year cycle. The Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to a historical market pattern revolving around the Bitcoin halving event, marked by price surges and drawdowns. The pattern begins with the accumulation phase, usually one year after the halving event, with long-term investors making sizable purchases. By the second or third year in the cycle, Bitcoin typically breaks its previous all-time high to trigger retail FOMO. The third or fourth year in the cycle is marked by sharp corrections, with previous pullbacks accumulating to 85% in losses. “I don’t think we’re gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,” said Hoskinson. Furthermore, Hoskinson added that new capital inflows and complex products will play a significant role in reducing Bitcoin’s volatility in the coming years. For Hoskinson, there will be “stronger floors and less volatility,” noting that large price jumps will be a thing of the past. He noted that reducing the volatility will play a significant role in boosting Bitcoin’s adoption to the “next half a billion people.” Hoskinson also added that regulations in the space will introduce new players with a specialty in stability and risk management, justifying his stance on lower volatility levels. Despite predicting the end of the four-year cycle for Bitcoin, Hoskinson disclosed that altcoin season will still exist in the near future. However, the Cardano founder opined that rather than a random price spurt for altcoins, key narratives will shape the ecosystem. For example, Hoskinson noted that the altcoin season of the last cycle was focused on the next Ethereum killer, leading to the rise of Solana and Polkadot. Hoskinson disclosed that the fourth-generation altcoin season will be dominated by privacy-focused projects, with the Cardano founder tipping Midnight for success.

Title: Wes Edens is selling his sprawling $35M penthouse — located in a famed architect’s only NYC building
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/09/real-estate/wes-edens-is-selling-his-sprawling-35m-penthouse/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T18:02:11Z

Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens has found a buyer for his trophy Manhattan penthouse, which was last asking $35 million. The posh perch overlooks the High Line at the curvaceous 520 W. 28th St., the only residential building in New York designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid — the first female architect to win the Pritzker Prize. And it’s about as far from Edens’ upbringing on a rural ranch in Montana as one could reasonably imagine. If the deal closes near that price, it would be a win for Edens, a co-founder of Fortress Investment Group and founder of New Fortress Energy, a liquefied natural gas company. As the sale is in contract, there’s no word yet on how much he’s selling it for — and who the new owner is. Edens, who got his start at BlackRock and Lehman Brothers, is also co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club and owns the e-sports franchise FlyQuest. In addition, he founded Brightline, a high-speed passenger rail system connecting Miami to Orlando at 125 miles an hour. Brightline also plans to connect Southern California and Las Vegas at speeds of about 200 miles per hour. The deal was first reported in the weekly Olshan Luxury Market Report. Edens bought the penthouse for $20.2 million in 2020 — four years after it hit the market for $50 million, and renovated it in 2022, according to the listing — from Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara, of Compass, who declined to comment on the pending deal. The 6,618-square-foot aerie comes with five bedrooms and seven baths, and features its own internal three-story sculptural staircase and private elevator — along with 2,500 square feet of outdoor space. The home opens to a great room with 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and views over the High Line. The room is further anchored by a large gas fireplace, custom lighting and a three-story chandelier. The main floor also comes with a chef’s kitchen, a media room, a library and a private balcony. Upstairs, a main bedroom suite comes with two walk-in closets, a spa-like bath, a sitting area and a private balcony. There are also an additional three bedrooms and a wet bar. Finally, a landscaped rooftop, “rebuilt from the studs” includes a sauna, a custom hot tub and cold plunge, a barbeque and an indoor wet bar. Amenities in the building — which was completed in 2017, a year after Hadid’s death of a heart attack at age 65 — include a 75-foot sky-lit pool, robotic parking and a private IMAX theater.

Business MILAN :A return of fund inflows into renewable energy stocks is helping to breath new life into these companies' shares, powering their strongest quarterly rise since the sustainability boom early this decade. After two years of bearish sentiment and relentless redemptions that made the sector a short-sellers' hotspot, a fundamental shift in the U.S. power demand outlook and greater policy certainty are luring investors back. U.S. President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and the subsequent move to direct the U.S. Treasury to restrict tax credit rules have hit the renewables industry. But money managers say the outcome was not as bad as many feared, and offers enough certainty for investors to engage and companies to resume projects. "Valuations were so disconnected from the fundamentals that even confirmation of negative news became a positive catalyst, said BlackRock portfolio manager Alastair Bishop. "It allowed investors to start focusing on the fundamentals." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday. This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading With the outlook improving, Bishop said outflows from BlackRock's active clean-energy strategies had slowed.Robeco portfolio manager Roman Boner said flows into the company's Smart Energy strategy had recently turned positive after sustained outflows. Lipper data shows alternative energy funds had their first net monthly inflow in June, after 25 straight months of outflows totalling around $24 billion. Investors pulled out money again in July before inflows returned in August and neared $800 million in September, the largest since April 2022. Quarterly data from Morningstar shows outflows from Clean Energy/Tech have shrunk to their lowest since the last recorded inflow in Q2 2023. These green shoots coincide with double-digit gains in clean energy indices, ETFs, and a surge in individual stocks across the sector — from producers to infrastructure plays. Bloom Energy is a prime example, teaming up with Oracle to deploy fuel cells at data centres. Its shares have rallied 300 per cent in four months to become the biggest weight in the iShares Clean Energy ETF, a jump some investors view as over-exuberant.The Federal Reserve's dovish tone has also helped. Capital-intensive renewable projects benefit from lower borrowing costs, though rates remain well above the ultra-low levels seen during ESG's heyday.PRIVATE EQUITY MOVES IN LOOKING FOR VALUEPrivate equity is also moving in, ignoring political noise to focus on long-term value. Global Infrastructure Partners is reportedly in talks to buy AES, potentially one of the largest deals involving a Wall Street power company. The MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index has halved since its January 2021 peak, but rose 17 per cent in the three months to September — its strongest quarter since end-2020 and more than double the broader market's gain.The rally, from a record-low base, has extended into October and is not purely U.S.-centricFirst Solar, a U.S. solar bellwether, climbed about 33 per cent over this period. Portuguese renewable energy company EDP Renovaveis rose 18 per cent.SHIFT IN MARKET FROM SUBSIDIES-DRIVEN TO DEMAND-LEDDriving the rally is rising electricity demand from Big Tech's rapid AI data centre build-outs, electrification of transport and industry, and the upgrading of grid infrastructure to handle new loads.U.S. power consumption, stagnant for over a decade, is forecast to grow sharply. With gas turbines in short supply and nuclear years away, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the only scalable short-term solution."Data centres need electricity in two to three years. People will just add as much renewables as they can. It's not only the cheapest source, but also the fastest to build," said Boner. These trends show renewable energy is morphing from a sector driven by policy and subsidies, to one shaped primarily by market forces, where strong demand requires all forms of energy."Every electron counts," Boner added.Cumulative new U.S. power generation demand is seen at 450 gigawatts by 2030, based on data presented by renewables developer NextEra. Of that, only 75 GW is projected from gas-fired plants, around 40 GW from deferred coal retirements, and limited nuclear contributions. Jonathan Waghorn, who manages both sustainable and fossil fuel funds at Guinness Asset Management, sees renewable earnings picking up, noting electricity demand forecasts have surged eightfold in just a few years."That's starting to get earnings momentum into the companies, especially those with AI, data centre, and grid-building exposure. The industry has just started to get going again, and the market is reacting."Waghorn's fund holds stocks involved in electrifying the energy mix like Eaton and Legrand. He also likes European names like cable maker Prysmian and grid services company Spie.Bishop expects earnings upgrades, typically supportive of price performance, and sees room for valuations to rise. At 14.6 times forward earnings, MSCI's Alternative Energy Index trades at a 40 per cent discount to world stocks, vs a 10-year average premium of 7.4 per cent, based on LSEG data, illustrating how the sector is currently valued well below the broader market despite historically commanding a premium. There are still risks - including higher-for-longer interest rates, policy reversals, and speculative retail excitement in unprofitable areas like new-generation nuclear - but some managers say unwinding bearish bets could help sustain the rally."There are still shorts to be squeezed out of the renewable space," said Luca Moro, CIO at SpesX, an energy transition fund. With the outlook improving, Bishop said outflows from BlackRock's active clean-energy strategies had slowed. Robeco portfolio manager Roman Boner said flows into the company's Smart Energy strategy had recently turned positive after sustained outflows. Lipper data shows alternative energy funds had their first net monthly inflow in June, after 25 straight months of outflows totalling around $24 billion.

These trends show renewable energy is morphing from a sector driven by policy and subsidies, to one shaped primarily by market forces, where strong demand requires all forms of energy. "Every electron counts," Boner added. Cumulative new U.S. power generation demand is seen at 450 gigawatts by 2030, based on data presented by renewables developer NextEra. Of that, only 75 GW is projected from gas-fired plants, around 40 GW from deferred coal retirements, and limited nuclear contributions. Jonathan Waghorn, who manages both sustainable and fossil fuel funds at Guinness Asset Management, sees renewable earnings picking up, noting electricity demand forecasts have surged eightfold in just a few years. "That's starting to get earnings momentum into the companies, especially those with AI, data centre, and grid-building exposure. The industry has just started to get going again, and the market is reacting." Waghorn's fund holds stocks involved in electrifying the energy mix like Eaton and Legrand. He also likes European names like cable maker Prysmian and grid services company Spie. Bishop expects earnings upgrades, typically supportive of price performance, and sees room for valuations to rise. At 14.6 times forward earnings, MSCI's Alternative Energy Index trades at a 40 per cent discount to world stocks, vs a 10-year average premium of 7.4 per cent, based on LSEG data, illustrating how the sector is currently valued well below the broader market despite historically commanding a premium. There are still risks - including higher-for-longer interest rates, policy reversals, and speculative retail excitement in unprofitable areas like new-generation nuclear - but some managers say unwinding bearish bets could help sustain the rally. "There are still shorts to be squeezed out of the renewable space," said Luca Moro, CIO at SpesX, an energy transition fund.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt. Global Infrastructure Partners, which BlackRock acquired a year ago, has a history of utility mergers, including a $6.2 billion deal that took public utility company Allete private.

If businesses pull back on their AI spending because they find the tools are not that helpful, it could cause major problems for the AI industry. By Thor Benson Share Save Despite United States President Donald Trump’s tariff and immigration policies roiling businesses, the US economy is relatively stable. Experts say the country can thank the artificial intelligence (AI) industry for that. “AI machines—in quite a literal sense—appear to be saving the US economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to his clients at the end of September. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the US would be close to, or in, recession this year.” Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has made similar observations in his Substack newsletter. AI companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and development, and other US companies are spending billions on AI products. Just last month, a data centre in Abeline, Texas, the flagship site of the $500bn Stargate programme, a joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and Japan’s SoftBank to advance AI infrastructure in the US, came online. Around the same time, chipmaker Nvidia said it would invest up to $100bn in OpenAI and provide it with data centre chips. It also became the first US company to hit a $4 trillion market value. It was soon followed in that benchmark by Microsoft, which has seen its stock price surge, with AI one of key factors driving business demand. Nvidia and Microsoft are not alone. Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have upped their commitments to their AI ambitions and investments. All of this enthusiasm surrounding AI appears to be holding up the US economy for the moment, but there are fears that this could be a “bubble” similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “The reason people are worried about an AI bubble is because seven companies are pulling more than 400 others forward,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, told Al Jazeera. A look at the S&P 500 shows that seven tech companies that are heavily involved in AI are the ones creating the most growth. Harvey admits that since it’s still early days in AI adoption and growth, it’s hard to say if the stocks of those tech companies are overvalued. “While share prices look somewhat elevated, there’s also real revenue behind the massive push to build data centres,” said Carl Frey, an associate professor of AI & Work at Oxford University. “A bubble may be building, but we’re nowhere near tulip mania territory,” he said, referring to the massive increase in tulip prices in the Netherlands in the 17th century, an event often held up as a hallmark of a bubble. “The worry is that early AI adopters are having second thoughts. Large corporations that rushed in are narrowing projects to the few that clearly save money or make money, and putting the rest on ice,” he said. For instance, major corporations like IBM and Klarna cut thousands of jobs in customer service and replaced them with AI—only to start reversing course not so long after they made that decision. They found the technology couldn’t do everything they hoped, compared to human workers. If major corporations that have spent large sums of money adopting AI tools end up deciding that these tools are not actually that useful for their businesses, that could be a serious problem for AI companies. They could end up with fewer customers, and their stock prices could begin to tumble as projected profits decline. A report released by MIT in August found that 95 percent of companies that have adopted AI are not achieving significant revenue acceleration from it. Data from the US Census Bureau shows that AI adoption by large companies has started to slow down recently. It would appear that people are starting to question the utility of these AI tools, which are often used to replace people in jobs like customer service, software engineering and several other entry-level jobs. “There’s a growing sense that a lot of companies raced to add AI to their operations last year because of the hype surrounding its power, and the fear of falling behind,” said Cal Newport, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. “It turns out, however, that integrating generative AI, in particular, into existing workflows in significantly useful ways is harder than people thought.” Newport says the underlying models in these AI programmes are currently “too unreliable” to be able to successfully automate jobs. He notes the idea that we would see AI rapidly taking jobs right now “has simply not come true”. A recent Stanford study found that entry-level jobs in customer service, accounting and software development have decreased by 13 percent since 2022 because of the adoption of AI tools in large companies. It’s not clear that AI has reached “bubble” territory yet, but it might, and if that bubble were to burst, it could do a lot of damage to the US economy. Frey says the dot-com bubble was very costly for investors, but it “left behind technologies and infrastructure that ultimately lifted productivity.” The question is whether this AI situation will play out the same way. “Unless an AI bust topples a major lender and triggers a full-blown financial crisis, the bigger risk today is different,” Frey said. “AI hasn’t yet delivered a clear, broad-based productivity boost—precisely what our stagnating economies need.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: How CIOs Can Overcome Enterprise AI Disappointment
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2025/10/09/how-cios-can-overcome-enterprise-ai-disappointment/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T16:41:00Z

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. AI’s place in the enterprise is maturing, and it’s no longer seen as “just an IT thing,” but that doesn’t mean that it has outgrown its problems. Forbes Research talked to 1,075 C-suite executives at large global companies in August and September and uncovered new challenges that are less about figuring out the basics of AI, and more about using it strategically. Just over half of executives—53%—are using AI “across the enterprise,” while the remainder are using it for “some initiatives,” the survey found. This is actually a decrease from the last two years—63% were using AI enterprise-wide in 2024, and 62% reported that blanket usage in 2023. This may indicate that companies are figuring out what AI can do best for them and concentrating its use in certain areas that have the most impact. Still, 56% are reporting an ROI of under 5% for their AI initiatives, so those more impactful uses are still developing. Right now, AI is relied upon as a strategic partner for several companies. More than four out of five respondents said AI is delivering significant gains to enhance decision making, operate more efficiently and improve product or service quality. Many of these functions are outside the traditional realm of the CIO’s office, as CEOs are becoming much more involved in AI decision making. The proportion of CEOs making decisions on AI has more than doubled since last year: 55% now from 26% last year. COOs and CFOs have also seen their involvement in AI decisions exponentially increase, with COOs going from 2% last year to 41% this year, and CFOs increasing from 1% last year to 38% this year. CIOs are still the most involved in AI decisions, taking part in 71% of them. As companies transition from the novelty of implementing AI to making it work effectively, there are many bumps in the road. Matt Calkins, CEO of AI-powered automation and orchestration platform Appian, says that there seems to be an “AI bubble” now—not referring to what’s going on with AI company valuations, but because prices for AI are high and the value to companies is lacking. He told me that’s more of a function of using AI for trivial tasks. An excerpt from our conversation about AI, as well as progress toward regulations, is later in this newsletter. We are currently accepting nominations for the Forbes CIO Next 2025 list. We’re looking for innovators who have had significant impacts both at their own companies and for other tech leaders on the whole. (And yes, you can nominate yourself.) Nominations are accepted until 5 p.m. ET October 30. AI is such a powerful and burgeoning area of business, there is no way that a single company will be able to dominate it. This week, OpenAI announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD, in which OpenAI plans to acquire and deploy six gigawatts worth of AMD’s AI chips. OpenAI plans to deploy 1 gigawatt of AMD’s Instinct MI450 GPUs next year. An SEC filing from AMD reveals that the company issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares—roughly 10% of the company—at one cent per share. Those shares will vest when share price milestones are met. This deal gives AMD a significant boost in both business in general and in its standing in the AI ecosystem. The company’s stock is up more than 38% in the last week, and the deal is a guarantee that AMD will continue to be a major player. Vasmi Boppana, AMD’s senior vice president of AI, told Forbes’ Richard Nieva that the deal was the result of both the performance of AMD’s chips and their software, which can unlock AI’s power. The OpenAI-AMD deal—and several others like it, involving tech companies that are working on AI platforms and infrastructure companies that make hardware or operate data centers—is an example of AI billionaires getting richer through deals with one another, writes Forbes’ Phoebe Liu. She writes that the spate of deals seems to stem from a stampede mentality. “There’s so much impatience and desire to move quickly, and fear of getting left behind, that there’s a very high premium on getting the most you can the fastest,” Stella Biderman, executive director of AI nonprofit EleutherAI, told Liu. The tech billionaire who has so far profited the most this year from the AI boom is Oracle’s Larry Ellison, but Oracle isn’t the only legacy tech company reinvigorated by AI. On Wednesday, Dell’s stock hit an all-time intraday high after nearly doubling its long-term guidance on demand for data centers. “As AI continues to expand into businesses and governments around the world, the opportunity ahead is massive,” chairman and CEO Michael Dell said in a statement. OpenAI’s ChatGPT can now seamlessly connect with third-party apps, CEO Sam Altman said this week at OpenAI’s DevDay event. Right now, Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify and Zillow are all available on ChatGPT. A ChatGPT user can use the chatbot to ask Spotify to make them a playlist, or to ask Zillow to find available real estate that meets specific location, size and price criteria. This ChatGPT functionality comes through OpenAI’s new Apps SDK platform. In a statement, OpenAI said that other companies will be connected with the chatbot soon, including Instacart, Target, AllTrails and Uber. Any developer can work now on building apps to connect with ChatGPT through the Apps SDK platform, which is available as a preview. OpenAI says it will start accepting app submissions for review and publication, and will share details on potential monetization. AI technology is still a boys’ club. A new report from the California Partners Project, Crunchbase and social impact organization illumyn Impact found that 43% of private AI companies have no women on their boards of directors, writes Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser. And just 5% of boards had an equal or greater share of women. While this disparity might just arise from the nature of private company boards—they’re often made up of founders and early funders, two areas in which women tend to be underrepresented—companies should be diligent and try to broaden their board representation. Adding independent director seats to boards—for people who have something to add, but aren’t directly involved with the company—is one way. But calling out this disparity also can be enough to make a difference. Crunchbase writes that five years ago, a third of all California-based public companies had no women board members. Nowadays, all-male boards are a very rare exception. When most people talk about an “AI bubble,” they’re referring to the sky-high valuations of companies that deal with aspects of the technology, which are consistently pushing the stock market to new highs. For Matt Calkins, CEO of AI-powered automation and orchestration platform Appian, the hype is more about the problem facing many companies as they implement the technology: Prices for AI are high and the value to companies is lacking. Calkins said this isn’t because AI isn’t helpful, but that companies are using it for mundane tasks that really don’t make a difference. I talked to him about how companies can shift that paradigm, as well as the regulatory outlook for AI systems and technology. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. You have a company using AI, but they’re using it for more clerical tasks that won’t make a huge difference to the company’s operations: Assistance with their help desk, refining presentations and documents, etc. How does this company go about reassessing what they can do with AI and how to make it work in a way that will impact the company? Calkins: You missed one descriptor of that sample company: They’re disappointed. They were expecting a revolution, and they tried all the things that seemed like the first application for AI. They went ahead and plugged in the chatbot, and they’re polishing their slides, and it’s just not mattering. So many companies are like this. It reminds me of what [economist] Robert Solow once said about the computer revolution back in the ‘80s: You could see it everywhere except in the productivity statistics. I feel like that’s true right now of AI: You can see AI everywhere except in the productivity statistics. All the companies out there are doing what they think they’re supposed to do, what they heard in the big speech, what they saw in the big commercial, what they read in the pitch document, and it didn’t work. It’s not that it failed, it just didn’t matter. And so where do you start with an organization like that? First of all, AI is going to matter. Don’t give up. We can still make a difference here. You just have to connect the AI to real work. I recommend we do that in a simple predictable context. It’s not going to be exciting, it’s going to be straightforward. We’re going to give it a job on a team in a process that matters to you. And you’ll see that AI is a very good worker. If AI stands to the side and waits to be asked a question or to polish a slide or something like that, AI is an indifferent contribution to your productivity. But as a worker, it’s something special. We’re going to make AI a worker, which just means we’re going to connect it to real work and track how it does. It’s going to do spectacularly because it is an exceptional piece of technology. We just need to set the expectations correctly and put it in the right place to make a difference. From a business standpoint, AI could freeze in time today for five years and it wouldn’t bother us at all. Right now, we need five years to digest this technology and connect it into real work to make it part of the way important work gets done. We don’t need to wait for AGI or for any other technological miracles. We need to learn how to connect this beautiful technology to real work. That’s where the value’s going to come from. People who think AI is disappointing, it’s just because they haven’t used it right. We talked about AI regulations last year. What do you think about where things are now? A lot’s changed, but I still think we need to do better. I believe that we have an opportunity to set clear, fair rules for a technology and thereby gain the most important thing that you could gain—which is not being the first to get a certain amount of data. The most important quantity that we could earn is trust. The most important quantity that determines the future of AI and its relationship with users and its technical sophistication is trust regulations—particularly stable, predictable regulations—to give us the framework in which the industry can build trust. The uncertainty right now is it’s self-destabilizing. On top of that, in some cases, AI is operating outside the law because the law is unclear. And I don’t believe that’s constructive for predictability, nor for rights. That’s data rights, privacy rights. I think it’s unhealthy the way it’s operating today. Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law establishing a comprehensive set of AI regulations. Considering the outsized role the state plays in the global tech industry, do you see this as a baseline for future state or federal regulation of AI? To me, this law checks the box as regulation even though it really doesn’t fill some of the most important gaps that regulation needs. For example, it does not have anything about privacy or copyright. It doesn’t even touch on it. Why would a major piece of AI legislation come out that doesn’t even touch on privacy and copyright ownership? It’s because the industry basically wrote it and they just don’t want to talk about that. This is not a good standard on which to base other laws. It lets the industry off the hook-on critical things. Also, it doesn’t talk about alignment. It talks about auditing and transparency but not about building AI models that comply with the wishes of their instructors. I think the federal government has virtually no chance of adopting this—at least during this presidency. I don’t see the federal government anywhere close to signing on to legislation like this even though it is industry-friendly. The easiest surface for a cyberattack is the human mind. Computer-based cybersecurity tactics are important, but it could be helpful to use behavioral science to enhance your enterprise’s security. Some Silicon Valley startups are bringing the 70-hour work week back. And while there is a lot to do, extreme hours can undermine worker (and executive) performance. Here’s why longer hours are not a good idea. Artist Jake Elwes turned the terms and conditions of which online company into a genre-spanning opera? A. Uber B. Facebook C. OpenAI D.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Empire Nears $100 Billion — But What’s the Real Endgame? | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how a single fund is rewriting the rules of finance, blurring the line between crypto and traditional markets. With it, concerns arise that its next milestone could change how power itself moves through money. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is closing in on a historic milestone of $100 billion in assets under management (AUM), just 22 months after its launch. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund has already surpassed legendary funds like VIG. It is now ranking 19th overall in AUM, signaling how fast Bitcoin has embedded itself into institutional finance. IBIT WATCH: lost a bit of aum yesterday bc of btc price decline but made it up w inflows. Still at $99b. So close yet so far. Just passed $VIG (an etf legend) to take the 19th spot in overall aum. pic.twitter.com/w5Lto2OaTP According to Onur, a Near Protocol ambassador and popular user on X (Twitter), IBIT’s $245 million annual fees reflect the extraordinary pace of institutional adoption. It now outpaces every other BlackRock ETF, some over a decade old. With $1.8 billion inflows last week alone and a path to $100 billion faster than any fund in history, IBIT shows how deep institutional adoption runs when Bitcoin rallies. This milestone is not happening in isolation, coming as part of a larger shift in how capital moves through crypto markets. Analysts increasingly argue that net inflows now matter more than fundamentals or narratives. “The only thing that matters in crypto right now is flows…net inflows (buy pressure) are infinitely more important than…fundamentals or narrative,” said analyst Miles Deutscher. That observation aligns with IBIT’s dominance in ETF flows. Over the past week alone, IBIT accounted for $3.5 billion in inflows, roughly 10% of all ETF flows across the US market. Even long-time laggards like GBTC saw inflows, a signal, Balchunas noted, that “the fish are hungry.” Behind these flows sits a staggering accumulation of Bitcoin. As of this week, BlackRock controls more than 802,000 BTC, following a fresh purchase of 3,450 coins. 🚨Blackrock Buys 3450 BitcoinNow Holds 802,200 BTC1M Bitcoin Soon. pic.twitter.com/NBEjRTrd12 At the current trajectory, the asset manager could soon hit 1 million BTC holdings, a figure representing a seismic shift in Bitcoin ownership concentration. A recent US Crypto News publication highlighted that the asset manager is nearing Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash. However, it is worth noting that other factors significantly affect BlackRock’s prospective $100 billion milestone. For perspective, Balchunas first anticipated BlackRock’s IBIT reaching $100 billion in July, which was over three months ago. “I wrote last week that IBIT could hit $100 billion this summer, but hell, it could be this month. Thanks to recent flows + overnight rally, it’s already at $88 billion,” Balchunas wrote at the time. Factors such as fluctuating flows and Bitcoin price volatility have been at play, derailing the landmark target. Notwithstanding, this fast-paced accumulation is intensifying questions about who ultimately controls Bitcoin’s future. While ETFs are expanding access, they are also centralizing custody and decision-making power in the hands of financial giants. Based on this, some critics see BlackRock’s ambitions extending beyond Bitcoin. Investigative journalist Whitney Webb warns that Larry Fink’s vision involves tokenizing and financializing natural assets on a “universal ledger” that would allow unprecedented tracking and control. “BlackRock being able to unlock and take control of as many natural assets as possible… is obviously a way for them to expand their control not just over people and the existing financial system, but really over the natural world as well,” Webb said in a recent interview. The convergence of Bitcoin ETF dominance and broader asset tokenization plans suggests a new financial infrastructure where Bitcoin could serve as both a liquidity magnet and a building block in a far more centralized global ledger.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Rockets Past 800,000 BTC Milestone In Record-Breaking Run
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-rockets-past-800000-btc-milestone-in-record-breaking-run/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T15:56:15Z

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds a staggering 800,000 Bitcoin (BTC), according to Glassnode data, and has accumulated $98 billion in assets under management in less than two years since its debut in January 2024. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now holds 802,200 BTC in its IBIT ETF, according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. The fund had amassed 798,747 BTC as of Oct. 7, per BlackRock’s own iShares website. IBIT’s purchase of 3,510 BTC (worth $426.2 million) yesterday was enough to push its total holdings above the 800K milestone. The market-leading ETF now holds roughly 3.804% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. IBIT accounts for over 55% of the total BTC held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs, data from Bitbo shows. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF holds more than Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which boasts a 640,031 BTC stockpile (valued at roughly $78 billion). The recent Bitcoin milestone comes amid reports that IBIT has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, surpassing the revenue of its flagship S&P 500 fund, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which debuted in 2000. Meanwhile, IBIT has led the charge in weekly inflows among all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, as pointed out by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “IBIT is #1 in weekly flows among all ETFs with $3.5 billion, which is 10% of all net flows into ETFs,” Balchunas wrote in a Wednesday X post. “Also notable is the rest of the 11 OG spot BTC ETFs all took in cash in the past week, even GBTC, somehow; that’s how hungry the fish are. Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” On Monday, the dozen BTC ETFs pulled in their biggest daily inflow since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump secured the presidency against Kamala Harris as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. These funds have now posted cumulative net inflows of $63 billion since their launch, with IBIT taking in $65 billion, offset by net outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Title: Valve’s Next Headset May Be Coming Soon, Just as Meta Loses Interest in VR
URL: https://gizmodo.com/valve-deckard-vr-headset-release-date-rumor-2000670266
Time Published: 2025-10-09T15:08:36Z
Full Content:
reading time 3 minutes I’ve been hitting the “it’s a bad time to be into VR” note a lot lately, and, sorry ya’ll, I stand by that stance… but maybe not for long. As discouraging as this year has been for VR enthusiasts (Meta barely mentioned the Quest at its annual Connect dev conference), Valve might swoop in sooner than you think to give VR hardware a shred of hope or at least a little bit of excitement. According to a report for XR Institute (a Chinese analyst group that I’ve cited before for accurate forecasts on smart glasses), Valve’s long-rumored “Deckard” headset is finally entering mass production, with a chance that it could be available before the end of the year. XR Institute says that it expects Valve to launch Deckard (an internal codename for the headset) during the holiday season with a starting yearly production of about 400,000 to 600,000 units. That’s about the initial Vision Pro release levels of stock and certainly much more encouraging than rumors about Samsung’s Project Moohan, which suggest a launch in South Korea only to start. While Deckard’s existence is from news, its imminent arrival isÂ a big deal, not just because of Valve’s success in the hardware space with the Steam Deck, but because of the de-emphasis of VR by other major players in the space. Apple is reportedly deprioritizing a cheaper Vision Pro to focus on smart glasses, while Meta already started that same train by launching three new pairs of smart glasses and zero new VR/XR headsets. While this might not be a shining moment for VR writ large, I like the prospects of a Valve-made VR headset. While other companies like Apple and most likely Samsung tend to take a more scattershot approach to XR/VR, incorporating work and communication, I expect Valve to focus more on gaming and less on the other stuff, which… is a good thing. I’m not saying there aren’t cool or fun experiences to be had outside of gaming in an XR/VR headset, but entertainment (games in particular) is still the most compelling of those experiences. Don’t get me wrong, the audience for VR games is niche, even despite the ascendence of VR headsets over the last five years, but it seems to me that the people who use headsets the most are the ones who are more deeply invested in playing games in them. VR gaming enthusiasts’ response to Valve’s headset is still dependent on a lot of things, though, price chief among them. Rumors from earlier this year have suggested Deckard could cost around $1,000, which is notably a lot more expensive than the Quest 3 and even more so than the Quest 3S, but still well under the $3,500 Vision Pro. To justify that price, I assume Valve will have to lean into its display tech, offering better resolution and probably better performance than competitors like the Quest 3 and 3S. A lighter headset would be a nice perk, but I’m not sure what Valve will have to offer on the front, if anything. SteamOS in VR seems like an obvious opportunity here, though, again, I’m not sure anyone will be rushing out to buy a new VR headset just for the UI. There’s still a lot we don’t know about Deckard, so it’s hard to say for sure whether it’ll be the jolt of excitement VR fans are pining for, but at least (between Project Moohan and Deckard) there’s something to look forward to.

Title: Bitwise ‘Not Playing Around,’ Proposes Low Fee For Its Solana Staking ETF As Official Launch Nears
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-not-playing-around-proposes-low-fee-for-its-solana-staking-etf-as-official-launch-nears/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T14:18:03Z
Full Content:
Crypto fund manager Bitwise designated a 0.20% fee for its Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund, which has a staking component, as asset managers inch closer to securing a green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their crypto-based ETFs. In a Wednesday amendment to its registration statement, Bitwise formally renames its fund to the “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while including language that enables it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.” By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains. The firm also stated that it would charge a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this incredibly low fee could be a sign of how competitive the investment vehicle could get among ETF issuers. “Bitwise not playing around, plans to charge just 0.20% for their spot Solana ETF,” Balchunas postulated. “Thought we’d see higher first, need war to get this low.” At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETFs, which often fall between 0.15% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among greenlighted crypto products. “Low fees have near perfect record of attracting investors so good sign for inflow potential,” Balchunas explained. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), the US’s first Solana staking ETF, ended its first day of trading with $12 million in inflows. The annual management fee for the SSK stands at 0.75%. According to Balchunas, Bitwise’s proposed offering is cheaper, has better tracking, and is 100% physically backed by Solana’s spot assets. “SSK is riddled with tracking issues like a futures ETF. It trails spot Solana by 12% — although it got better in the past month,” he opined. Despite leading the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to submit paperwork with the SEC for an SOL ETF. In August, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that it would be “messed up” if BlackRock were to file a last-minute application to debut its own SOL product simultaneously with other bidders, after those firms had already spent so much time working with the U.S. regulator to get the paperwork right. Nonetheless, analysts have predicted that several applications for Solana ETFs with staking could win the SEC’s regulatory blessing in the course of this month.

Title: OpenAI’s Strategic Shift: What The AMD And Nvidia Partnerships Signal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/10/09/openais-strategic-shift-what-the-amd-and-nvidia-partnerships-signal/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
BySol Rashidi, Contributor. AMD, Advanced Micro Devices saw a 23.71% surge in its share price this week, driven by a high-profile partnership with OpenAI that could fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape in AI computing infrastructure. The deal, centered around AMD’s graphics processing units (GPUs), will supply OpenAI with an initial 1-gigawatt of computing power beginning in the second half of 2026. What’s interesting about this partnership is, this isn’t just another chip supply agreement—it appears to be a calculated strategic move that gives OpenAI options for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, a stake potentially worth billions. This announcement comes just two weeks after OpenAI inked a $100 billion equity and data deal with Nvidia. This marks a clear shift in OpenAI’s ambitions to vertically integrate compute, data, and model training at unprecedented scale. According to sources close to the matter, OpenAI will tap AMD’s Instinct MI300X accelerators, which have emerged as viable competitors to Nvidia’s H100 in certain high-throughput AI workloads. The company will gain access to a gigawatt-scale infrastructure footprint by late 2026—a move likely to insulate it from compute shortages that have plagued the AI industry over the past 18 months. While the dollar figure remains undisclosed, the scale of the deal—coupled with the 160 million share option—signals a valuation easily in the multibillion-dollar range. For perspective, AMD’s total market capitalization currently sits north of $180 billion, and the share options represent nearly 9% of the company’s outstanding shares. What this new structure is telling us is OpenAI isn’t just a customer—it’s positioning itself as a strategic partner, if not an indirect stakeholder. The option to own nearly a tenth of AMD gives OpenAI substantial negotiating leverage and aligns both companies’ incentives to optimize AMD’s chips for future GPT models. OpenAI is not a traditional enterprise customer, it appears to be morphing into a power broker within the semiconductor ecosystem through the following avenues: For AMD, the deal is a validation of its long-term strategy to challenge Nvidia’s AI dominance. Its MI300X chips, launched in late 2023, have seen gradual uptake in hyperscale environments. But with OpenAI’s endorsement, AMD now has a marquee customer that could catalyze broader adoption. Expect AMD’s software ecosystem—to receive increased investment, while new benchmarking metrics may emerge to compare GPT training performance across vendors. For Nvidia, the deal is less a loss and more a wake-up call. While it still dominates AI acceleration, OpenAI’s move signals that no vendor is too big to compete with. It’s also a hedge against Nvidia’s own ambitions in AI services and inference, which increasingly overlap with OpenAI’s. For the broader market, this marks a splintering of the AI hardware stack. Rather than standardizing on a single vendor, the next generation of AI firms—spurred by OpenAI’s model—may adopt multi-vendor architectures, mixing AMD, Nvidia, and even custom silicon like Google’s TPUs. The AMD partnership is more than a procurement deal—it’s frankly a masterclass in strategic positioning. OpenAI has quietly built a playbook based on ecosystem control, upstream equity leverage, and industrial-scale deployment, setting the tone for the next phase of AI’s evolution. By aligning itself with both Nvidia and AMD—and demanding favorable terms via options and equity—OpenAI ensures both security and influence over its most critical dependency: compute. In the words of Peter Drucker, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” OpenAI isn’t waiting for the AI infrastructure to evolve—it appears to be building it, one chip deal at a time.

Title: AMD Stock To $450?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines by landing a major deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years. The deal represents one of the largest chip orders ever placed in the AI sector and underscores how OpenAI is looking to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond industry standard Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which holds over 75% of the AI compute market. AMD stock has surged by close to 40% since the deal was announced, and currently trades at about $235 per share. Is OpenAI’s next bet Intel Stock? Could AMD stock reach $450 in the next few years? It probably can. AMD stock trades at about 70x trailing adjusted earnings and roughly 60x projected 2025 earnings. Is this pricey? Not exactly. Especially when you consider AMD's steadily expanding earnings base, the accelerating demand for AI compute, and the multi-year growth runway now unlocked by its OpenAI contract. Also, for perspective, Nvidia’s market cap exceeds $4.5 trillion - more than 12 times AMD’s valuation - illustrating just how large the addressable market remains. As AMD begins to execute on this massive contract, it’s not unreasonable to see its multiple hold up - or even expand - as revenue visibility improves. In the scenario below, we use AMD's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $450-plus stock price in the coming years. AMD stock has jumped meaningfully recently, but there is significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a value to a broader, diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you buy one stock you like or build a portfolio designed to win across cycles? Our numbers show that High Quality Portfolio has turned stock-picking uncertainty into market-beating consistency. This portfolio is incorporated in the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager and Trefis partner - whose asset allocation framework yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. AMD-OpenAI Deal Will Drive Revenue Surge AMD’s revenues have risen considerably from $6.7 billion in 2019 to about $26 billion in 2024, an annual growth of over 31%, and the momentum can hold up. Consensus projects a close to 28% growth for 2025. However, with the OpenAI deal, there is a real likelihood for AMD to grow its sales at a higher pace in the next few years, led by growth in accelerated computing space and its new GPUs. Although AMD’s OpenAI deal won’t boost revenue immediately, it will have a considerable impact in the coming years. The first real sales impact starts in the second half of 2026, when MI450 and Helios systems begin deployment. The major revenue ramp is likely to come in 2027, as the large-scale installations could generate tens of billions in annual AI data center revenue. Over the next few years, AMD expects the partnership — along with related follow-on deals - to contribute over $100 billion in cumulative sales over four years. Considering this, it’s probably reasonable to assume sales will grow by about 33% from an estimated $33 billion in FY’25 to around $43 billion by FY’26. Sales could grow by about 50% over 2027 and 2028. This could translate into revenue of approximately $96 billion by FY'28. OpenAI’s endorsement is more than a sales win, it’s also a validation for AMD's chips. Being chosen by the leading AI software player gives AMD credibility that could attract other hyperscalers and enterprise customers. This could help to further boost demand and sales. Moreover, the AI workload mix is shifting from training to inference - using trained models for real-world applications. Inference favors efficiency and cost-effectiveness over brute-force performance, areas where AMD’s architectures can shine. This is in contrast with the training phase, where Nvidia's cutting edge chips were far ahead of the pack. (See How Inference Changes The AI Landscape) Higher-End Products Can Drive Margins Combine this robust revenue growth with the fact that AMD's adjusted net margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 11% in FY'19 to over 21% in FY'24 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Margins could potentially trend still higher to levels of about 25%, as AMD sees higher economies of scale, improving its fixed cost absorption. Now combining 25% adjusted net margins, with about $96 billion in revenue, would translate into earnings of about $24 billion. That's a roughly 4.4x increase in adjusted net income from levels seen in 2024. An $800 Billion Market Cap Now, if earnings grow 4.4x, the price-to-earnings multiple would theoretically shrink by a similar factor, from about 70x to roughly 16x, assuming the stock price stayed flat. But that’s exactly what AMD investors are betting will not happen. As earnings expand sharply over the next few years, a more likely scenario is that AMD's P/E stabilizes closer to say 35x, reflecting stronger growth visibility and improving profitability. Under those assumptions, AMD’s market capitalization could rise to around $840 billion. There is, however, a small caveat to this upside story for shareholders - dilution. As part of the OpenAI agreement, AMD issued warrants allowing OpenAI to purchase up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company, contingent on performance milestones such as the initial gigawatt rollout and certain share price targets. If OpenAI chooses to exercise and sell those shares — possibly to help fund its chip purchases — the move could dilute existing shareholders. That said, dilution doesn’t necessarily negate value creation. If AMD’s overall valuation expands meaningfully on the back of this partnership, the deal remains net accretive. Even assuming a 10% additional share count, a stock price of roughly $450 appears plausible upside within the next few years. So what about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? While our above example illustrates a roughly three year time frame, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes three years or four, as long as AMD is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ‘Blown Away’—Bitcoin Braced For A $100 Billion BlackRock Earthquake As Wild Price Swings Rock Crypto

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/10 update below. This post was originally published on October 09 Bitcoin has surged into October, with traders strapping in for a market “frenzy” in coming months. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has hit a fresh all-time high over $126,000 per bitcoin, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.5 trillion amid fears of a Federal Reserve-fueled U.S. dollar crisis. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump floats the idea of a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, BlackRock’s market-leading spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on the verge of crossing $100 billion in assets under management—on track to hit the milestone far faster than any other ETF in history. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock’s IBIT, which launched in January 2024 to huge fanfare, has surged thanks to massive inflows over the last few months and the increase in the value of the bitcoin price itself. The fund now has assets of $98.6 billion and could cross the psychological line in a matter of days. 10/10 update: The bitcoin price has dipped as the crypto market rally comes off the boil, even as the Federal Reserve looks all but certain to cut interest rates again later this month. “Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “This spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Following a 3% dip from $123,000 to $120,000, bitcoin has recovered to $121,600. According to Coinglass data, a dense band of short positions is at risk of liquidation just above this level. A modest push upward could trigger a cascade of liquidations and propel BTC back toward $125,000 and beyond." Bitcoin and crypto traders remain bullish despite the latest bitcoin pull back, with analysts pointing to a mismatch between current price action and the underlying market. “Bitcoin is up 7% in October, perfectly matching its seasonal pattern — but this time, the rally feels different,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “Despite trading near all-time highs, momentum is fading, and what once looked like a clean breakout now sits in no-man’s-land. Beneath the surface, the story unfolds differently: institutional whales are buying aggressively, while early adopters quietly sell into strength.” Bitcoin ETFs could add another $20 billion worth of inflows before the end of the year, according to some market watchers, with the lion's share of that likely to go to BlackRock's bitcoin fund. “Following the recent rally over the first weekend of ‘Uptober’, which saw bitcoin’s price surge to a new all-time high above $125,000, record-level ETF inflows totalled above $3 billion across the first week of the month,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform BOB, said in emailed comments. BlackRock’s IBIT is on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with it also “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs. BlackRock's flagship S&P 500 ETF took 25 years to reach its current revenue levels, while IBIT has achieved higher profitability in less than two years. The fund, charging a 0.25% fee, is thought to bring in annual revenue of $240 million for BlackRock, becoming the most profitable BlackRock ETF when it surpassed BlackRock’s IWF and EFA funds in July. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive," Seyffart, who added that BlackRock’s bitcoin fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their launches last year, told Bloomberg. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” The BlackRock bitcoin fund has become the de facto route for traditional finance to gain bitcoin exposure, with the surging popularity of the "debasement trade" this year catapulting bitcoin higher along with gold. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “While it’s very possible that gold will continue to outperform other assets for the foreseeable future, it has certainly become a crowded trade,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. "That means there is more risk involved in initiating exposure at this point. After more than a 50% rally in the gold price year-to-date, attention may now turn to other alternatives that express a similar view. These include other metals and commodities, tokenized real assets, and bitcoin, which remain undervalued against gold. These alternative assets can all play a similar role in portfolios—a hedge against future inflation and political intervention, and an alternative to the U.S. dollar and other debasing currencies.” Crypto ETFs more widely drew record inflows of almost $6 billion globally last week, according to data from CoinShares. "This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty," James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made news by entering into a significant agreement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to provide tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing power over the forthcoming five years. The initial gigawatt comprising AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 chips will be delivered in the latter half of 2026. This contract signifies one of the largest individual chip acquisitions ever made in the AI industry and highlights OpenAI's efforts to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond the industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which commands over 75% of the AI computing market. This strategic shift could represent a pivotal moment, not only for AMD but also for the ongoing expansion of the AI computing sector, opening avenues for emerging leaders in the AI semiconductor arena. The next phase of the AI computing race will no longer be about just training large language models – it’s increasingly about inference, or putting AI to work in the real world. Training is akin to teaching an AI model everything they know, while inference is when that knowledge is applied – answering questions, generating text, or running chatbots millions of times a day. As AI applications scale to hundreds of millions of users, the demand for inference capacity is set to explode. Running these workloads efficiently has become the new bottleneck, forcing companies to rethink how and where they deploy compute. Nvidia has dominated training with its H100 and A100 GPUs, but inference could shift the equation. Once models are trained, they must run continuously across billions of devices, making energy efficiency, latency, and hardware availability crucial factors. Nvidia Stock 2x To $350? That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As AI matures, more of the value creation could shift from training toward inference. Morgan Stanley projects roughly $3 trillion will be invested into the AI build out over the next three years – and it is likely that a significant portion will flow toward inference. To put this in perspective: Nvidia’s market cap is currently around $4.5 trillion, fueled largely by its dominance in training. But inference could actually be the bigger market. In the coming years, inference could easily surpass training in total revenue and total GPU units shipped, opening a new frontier in the AI chip race. This could favor companies that offer cheaper, more energy-efficient, and readily available chips, not just the most powerful ones. This shift opens the field to a broader range of players. So who are the potential winners here? Nvidia is likely to remain a leading player even as the AI market shifts. The company’s deeply entrenched software ecosystem – including CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN – are likely to have locked in many early customers. It is also adapting its product line, focusing on powerful new chip architectures for inference and optimized inference software to meet growing workloads from video generation to large-scale real-time AI applications. Combined with its strong partnerships across hyperscalers, AI startups, and enterprise customers, the company is likely to remain an AI leader, although it’s very likely that its share of the AI compute market will trend lower. AMD has considerably lagged Nvidia in the early stage of the AI build out, but it could emerge as a key challenger to Nvidia in inference. The OpenAI partnership further validates AMD’s position as a serious inference player and signals that the company is steadily carving out a place as a preferred provider for scalable, efficient AI compute solutions. AMD chips are increasingly competitive in performance while offering cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations need or can afford Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs. Many are likely to opt for older Nvidia chips or cost-effective alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which offer solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Intel might seem like a wildcard in the AI chip race, but it has a credible shot at the inference market. Its broad portfolio – including CPUs, Gaudi Habana accelerators, and an extensive datacenter ecosystem – positions Intel to deliver energy-efficient, high-volume inference solutions. Intel’s fabs could benefit as AI inference drives demand for high volumes of lower- to mid-tier chips, which Intel may be more well-positioned to produce for other companies. While its Intel’s process technology lags the likes of TSMC at the cutting edge for top-tier GPUs, it is probably more than capable of fabricating efficient, cost-effective inference chips. See: OpenAI’s Next Bet: Intel Stock? ASIC, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are increasingly gaining attention in the AI space. Unlike versatile, general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are engineered for a single task, making them far more cost- and energy-efficient for large-scale inference workloads. The crypto industry offers a clear precedent: Bitcoin mining initially relied on GPUs, but rapidly shifted to ASICs once scale and efficiency became paramount. related How Marvell Stock Surges To $140 A similar evolution could play out in AI inference. Two companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are Marvell, which has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, and Broadcom, both with proven expertise in designing custom silicon for hyperscalers. Broadcom, in particular, has emerged as a standout, securing a $10 billion deal with OpenAI. Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? U.S. Big Tech such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are all designing AI chips. Amazon has leaned into training-focused chips, Meta started with inference and is expanding to training, while Google supports both through its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the motivation is not necessarily to beat Nvidia in the market but to lower costs, gain supply control, and improve bargaining power within their massive cloud ecosystems. Over time, that means less incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Over Q2, Nvidia said that just two of its customers made up roughly 39% of total revenue — likely these big U.S. tech firms — making it vulnerable if they shift workloads to in-house silicon or lower-cost suppliers. Chinese Internet Giants In China, companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Huawei are stepping up their AI chip efforts. Recent reports suggested that Alibaba plans to launch a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to power inference at scale using its own tech stack, and to secure a steady supply of semiconductors amid U.S. export restrictions. For now, Nvidia’s GPUs are still expected to form the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training workloads, but inference is likely to become the longer-term growth driver for the company. related Alibaba’s AI Chip A Big Deal? Beyond semiconductors, growing AI inference workloads will drive demand for supporting infrastructure. Fast, reliable, and intelligent networking will be critical to handle billions of requests daily. Companies like Arista Networks and Cisco are well-positioned to benefit, as ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects become essential for moving massive datasets between servers, GPUs, and cloud nodes in real time. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Title: AI isn’t in a bubble—the cash (and the hype) are real, these analysts say

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high Wednesday (up 0.58% on the day), driven as usual by tech stocks (the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.12%), despite the fact that both the IMF and the Bank of England warned that AI might be a bubble and stocks are due for a sharp correction. For weeks, all the talk on Wall Street is that the growth of the AI sector must, surely, be unsustainable and that this bubble is due to pop. The record-high price of gold alone suggests that a lot of investors want a hedge against an implosion in U.S. tech stocks. Yet some analysts are saying that you should believe the hype. They argue: The biggest cheerleader for AI is, of course, Dan Ives at Wedbush, who recently published a note titled “Expecting a Robust 3Q Tech Earnings Season to Match the AI Hype; Popcorn Moment.” “The cloud stalwarts Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had very robust AI enterprise demand in the quarter based on our field checks. While some investors continue to question the valuations and pace of this tech spending trend, we believe to the contrary the Street is still underestimating how big this AI spending trajectory is,” he told clients. He believes these companies will spend $3 trillion on AI over the next three years. Importantly, that spending isn’t coming from debt or VC funding, according to Jan Frederik Slijkerman and Timothy Rahill at ING. They recently published a note examining whether all this AI spending might hurt corporate credit quality and discovered that … everything is totally fine! “Investments by the largest technology companies [Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle] are expected to surpass the U.S.$400 billion mark in 2026 … The investments described above are mind-blowing, given their scale. What is even more striking is that these investments have been funded from operating cash flows,” they wrote. “From a debtholder perspective, we are less concerned with a potential mismatch between supply and demand, as the large technology platforms mentioned above have funded their expansion plans from their cash flows,” they said. Goldman Sachs agrees, in part for the same reasons. The bank published a note yesterday titled “Why we are not in a bubble … yet,” which pretty much says it all. Still, surely stocks are overvalued? The majority of gains in the S&P 500 this year have been driven by a handful of tech companies. That concentration risk could hurt investors if there is a pullback. We aren’t there yet, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial in Boston. “The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of the S&P 500 has yet to reach dotcom era levels, and in fact remains below December 2020 levels because earnings were depressed coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in a note today. “So large-cap stocks are expensive, lifted by AI-driven technology stocks, but not quite to the extremes of 25 years ago.” The economics of AI are much more robust than the dotcom era, he says. “Perhaps the key difference between the broader secular AI growth theme and the dotcom era is that large AI hyperscalers have mostly funded capital expenditures (capex) with strong internal cash flows, not through AI revenue in singularity or by issuing debt or equity. In comparison, dotcom era spending was broadly funded through massive amounts of ‘vendor financing,’ which ultimately led to the circular flow of capital that fueled the bubble burst.” And even if there is a correction, it won’t be too bad, argue Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen at Pantheon Macroeconomics. They estimate that AI capex boosted U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% points. Even if it all disappeared it would not be enough to tip the U.S. into recession, they say. “Weaker growth is more likely than a recession if the AI boom turns to bust,” they said in a note to clients. “The likely hit from the AI boom turning to bust would be a significant drag on the economy, but probably a smaller shock than the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, and an ensuing recession would be far from a forgone conclusion.” That comes with a caveat: “It would be more alarming, though, if a reversal of AI optimism led to a broader correction in the stock market beyond AI-linked companies, especially if the hit to households’ wealth and confidence tipped the fragile balance in the labor market, leading to a jump in the layoff rate,” they said.

Title: I Asked Meal Planning Experts: What Are the Best Foods to Buy in Bulk?

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We consulted experts to identify which foods deliver the biggest savings and fewest store runs when purchased in bulk. When it comes to bulk buying, not all foods are created equal. Food costs keep squeezing household budgets across the country, with grocery bills still causing the biggest sticker shock. To help people cope, we've tested different money-saving approaches: rescuing discounted food through apps like Flashfood, pitting name brands against generic alternatives and investigating whether discount grocers like Trader Joe's live up to their budget-friendly reputations. Another proven approach is bulk buying. Loading up on household essentials at warehouse clubs like Costco can slash your grocery spending considerably. When I ran the numbers, the potential annual savings came to roughly $1,000 for the typical shopper who commits to buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't as simple as signing up for Costco or Sam's. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Title: OpenAI's ChatGPT Instant Checkout: The Dawn of Conversational Commerce CX

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Since its November 2022 launch, ChatGPT has become synonymous with general AI capabilities. Now OpenAI is extending its influence toward a new frontier: ecommerce. OpenAI has officially transformed ChatGPT from a discovery tool into a complete commerce platform with the launch of Instant Checkout, powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe. Starting with U.S. Etsy sellers and expanding soon to over one million Shopify merchants, including Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori, this development represents more than just another checkout option. It is a fundamental reimagining of the customer experience journey that could have been implications on the customer experience industry. Customer experience professionals in e-commerce and retail recognize OpenAI’s entry as a signal that the entire paradigm of how customers discover and purchase products is shifting toward agentic commerce — online shopping managed with AI. Instant Checkout enables ChatGPT users to complete purchases without leaving the conversational interface. When someone asks a shopping-related question—"best running shoes under $100" or "gifts for a ceramics lover"—ChatGPT displays relevant products from across the web. For items where Instant Checkout is enabled, users see a "Buy" button that lets them complete the entire transaction within the chat. The technical foundation is the Agentic Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard co-developed with Stripe that OpenAI is making available to any merchant or developer. This protocol creates a secure payment framework where ChatGPT acts as the user's AI agent, passing information between customer and merchant while the merchant retains full control as the merchant of record. Merchants handle orders, process payments through their existing systems (Stripe or otherwise), manage fulfillment and own the customer relationship post-purchase. Currently supporting single-item purchases for U.S. users of the Plus, Pro, and Free tiers, OpenAI plans to expand to multi-item carts and additional regions. The company emphasizes that product recommendations are organic and unsponsored, ranked purely by relevance, with merchants paying a small transaction fee on completed purchases. For customers, the service is free and doesn't affect product prices. ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers can leverage saved payment methods and shipping details for even faster checkout, though all users must explicitly confirm each step before purchase. This represents OpenAI's first major move toward what they call "agentic commerce"—a platform where AI doesn't just help you find products but actively facilitates purchasing them on your behalf, with the long-term vision of more autonomous shopping experiences. Related Article: Agentic AI and the Future of Customer Support: What CX Leaders Need to Know Ecommerce has long been a goal of every digital platform, from the leaders of internet browsers to social media platforms. Yet the customer journey of most ecommerce attempts often includes friction points for customers to complete a purchase: multiple browser tabs and re-entering payment information, all while having users create an account, can lead to abandoned carts. Many experts had hoped social commerce – retail through social media – would minimize the friction points. The volume of US social commerce did rise, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise of direct-to-customer retail placed a spotlight on aligning click-through behavior and sales, creating high interest in a cart checkout with just a few clicks. OpenAI's launch of Instant Checkout approaches a speedy checkout with a "chat to checkout in just a few taps." Here's how Instant Checkout works: A customer asks ChatGPT for "gifts for a ceramics lover," receives curated product recommendations, sees a "Buy" button on items with Instant Checkout enabled, and completes the purchase without ever leaving the conversation. For ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, the platform can prefill shipping and payment details, making the experience even more seamless. This level of convenience raises the digital customer experience bar significantly. If customers can complete a purchase in seconds through conversational AI, they'll increasingly expect similarly frictionless experiences everywhere else. Retailers who maintain clunky checkout processes will feel the comparison acutely. One of the most significant customer experience implications involves trust and transparency. OpenAI emphasizes that product results are "organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user," and that Instant Checkout availability doesn't influence product rankings. When multiple merchants sell the same product, ChatGPT considers availability, price, quality, primary seller status and Instant Checkout availability to optimize user experience. One potential shift for customers is the kinds of trust signals to look while shopping online. Customers have spent years learning which search results, sponsored placements and algorithmic recommendations to trust. They know when they're being marketed to. Conversational AI collapses those visual cues. There's no "Ad" label or comparison shopping pages, verifying that you're seeing the best options. For CX professionals, this creates a paradox. The experience feels more personal and helpful—like getting advice from a knowledgeable friend—but the mechanisms driving recommendations remain opaque. OpenAI's commitment to relevance-based ranking is important, but maintaining customer trust will require ongoing transparency about how these decisions are made. Unlike marketplace models where the platform intermediates the customer relationship, OpenAI positions itself as the customer's "AI agent—securely passing information between user and merchant, just like a digital personal shopper would." Merchants remain the merchant of record, handling orders, payments, fulfillment and customer support through their existing systems. This architectural choice has profound CX implications. When issues arise—damaged goods, shipping delays, return requests—customers must navigate the merchant's existing support infrastructure. They can't simply resolve everything in ChatGPT. OpenAI explicitly states that "merchants use your order information to complete the order, but OpenAI asks merchants to not sign users up for marketing emails from their ChatGPT orders." This creates a potential friction point. Customers who complete purchases in a conversational environment may expect conversational support. They'll ask ChatGPT about order status, return policies or replacement requests. While ChatGPT can surface information, the actual resolution still requires engaging with the merchant directly. For retailers, this means your post-purchase CX needs to match the seamlessness of the purchasing experience. If ChatGPT makes buying easy but your support remains difficult, the disconnect will be glaring. ChatGPT's existing features—Memory, Custom Instructions and conversation history—create opportunities for deeply personalized commerce experiences. The platform can remember that you prefer sustainable products, have a specific budget range, or are shopping for someone with particular interests. This contextual awareness enables product recommendations that feel genuinely helpful rather than algorithmically generic. For customer experience strategy, this represents a shift from session-based commerce to persistent relationship commerce. Instead of starting fresh with each visit, customers maintain an ongoing dialogue where preferences, constraints and needs are already understood. It's the digital equivalent of shopping with a personal stylist who remembers your taste, size and budget. However, this also requires rethinking privacy and consent. OpenAI notes that "to respond to your shopping question, ChatGPT uses your query and available context (such as Memory or Custom instructions)." Customers may not fully grasp how much information they're sharing through casual conversation or how it's being used to shape recommendations. Related Article: Humans Put ChatGPT Customer Experience Outcomes to the Test Currently, Instant Checkout supports single-item purchases only. OpenAI plans to add multi-item carts and expand merchant and regional availability. But the real customer experience transformation lies in what OpenAI calls "agentic commerce"—where AI doesn't just help you find what to buy but actually makes purchases on your behalf. Imagine asking ChatGPT to "stock my pantry with staples I usually buy" or "replace my worn-out workout clothes with similar items" and having it autonomously complete those purchases based on your preferences, budget and past behavior. OpenAI emphasizes that "users stay in control—they explicitly confirm each step before any action is taken," but it's easy to see how this could evolve toward greater autonomy. From a CX perspective, this promises ultimate convenience but introduces new anxieties. What happens when the AI makes a wrong assumption? How do you dispute an order you didn't manually approve? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during casual conversation? These aren't theoretical concerns—they're fundamental customer experience challenges that will need addressing as agentic commerce matures. Traditional ecommerce has maintained a clear separation between discovery (search engines, social media, content sites) and purchase (retailer websites, marketplaces). ChatGPT collapses this continuum entirely. The same conversation that starts with "how do I decorate a small apartment" can seamlessly transition to purchasing specific furniture pieces without the customer ever consciously entering "shopping mode." This fluidity creates immense convenience but also removes traditional decision-making waypoints. In conventional ecommerce, the journey from discovery to checkout includes multiple opportunities for price comparison, reading reviews and specification verification. Conversational commerce compresses these steps, potentially reducing buyer confidence even as it increases convenience. Savvy retailers will need to ensure their product information, reviews and trust signals are accessible within conversational contexts. If ChatGPT recommends your product, customers should still be able to access detailed specifications quickly, customer reviews, return policies and other information that builds purchase confidence. Actions ecommerce and CX professionals can take to prepare for conversational commerce. OpenAI's move follows a broader trend of commerce functionality migrating to conversational interfaces powered by AI. Meta has been experimenting with business messaging on WhatsApp and Instagram. Google has integrated shopping into search results, hoping to further leverage its AI Overview integration with its search engine. But OpenAI's approach—combining product discovery, recommendation and checkout entirely within a conversational AI interface—represents the most complete implementation yet. OpenAI’s decision to open-source the Agentic Commerce Protocol suggests ecosystem ambitions. By creating a standard that works across AI platforms and payment processors, OpenAI is positioning conversational commerce as infrastructure, not just a ChatGPT feature. Marketing professionals must monitor adoption of conversational commerce as an element of marketing strategies and campaigns. Moreover, competitors who are still finding their AI strategy will see the Agentic Commerce Protocol as a significant competitor. Amazon, for example, has long offered shopping capabilities with Alexa. But partners in the Alexa ecosystem may move toward Open AI if Amazon does not launch a similar AI protocol for Alexa. Traditional ecommerce metrics—bounce rate, cart abandonment, time on site—don't translate cleanly to conversational commerce. New ways to measure engagement, conversion and satisfaction when shopping happens inside AI conversations. These metrics will help retailers understand whether conversational commerce delivers genuine CX improvements or simply novelty-driven early adoption. OpenAI's Instant Checkout raises as many customer experience questions as it answers: How will product returns work when the purchase was made conversationally? Can customers modify orders placed through ChatGPT? What happens when products are out of stock after ChatGPT recommends them? How do subscription services and recurring purchases translate to conversational commerce? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during ambiguous conversations? These implementation details are fundamental to whether conversational commerce is a fit for the seamless customer experience being sought. Marketers should consider whether the answers mean achieving the promised experiences or are an indicator of implementation frustrations. Learn how you can join our contributor community.

Title: How Asset Managers Can Eliminate Child And Forced Labor From Their Portfolios
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bhaktimirchandani/2025/10/09/how-asset-managers-can-eliminate-child-and-forced-labor-from-their-portfolios/

ByBhakti Mirchandani, Contributor. Child labor is a large and growing problem in the United States. With child labor violations in the US up 79% year-over-year following an 140% increase over the past decade, detecting and mitigating child labor violations is material for all investors. This is the second article in a series on child and forced labor due diligence and monitoring. The series draws from guides for asset owners and asset managers that Kathy Hahn and Juho Rana Kim from Casey Family Programs, Jerome McCluskey of Latham & Watkins, and I co-authored following consultations with and/or contributions from over 100 experts, ranging from Save the Children to Neuberger Berman and from UNICEF USA and its Impact Fund for Children to BlackRock. This one-page child and forced labor due diligence guide for asset managers consists of six due diligence questions for asset managers to use when underwriting portfolio companies. If the answers to all of the questions immediately below are no, the process is complete. If the answer to any of the questions below is yes, asset managers would proceed with the longer questionnaire that follows further below. Alternatively, questions may be adapted and put to management or the compliance team of a target on a legal due diligence call. This guide is designed to be intuitive enough for any team member to use and brief enough for investment team members to hang in their cubicles as a reference to use while underwriting and monitoring portfolio companies. The following tables present a four-page child and forced labor due diligence questionnaire for asset managers to use with higher risk portfolio companies. If answers to any of the questions in the Standard Questionnaire immediately below are unclear or suggest a higher level of risk, parts or all of the Detailed Questionnaire should be applied based on the responses to the Standard Questions. As Human Rights Watch Senior Researcher Jim Wormington notes, optimal use of the Detailed Questionnaire would require in-house sector expertise, external partners, or both, and asset managers should consider resource requirements. Asset managers would naturally vary the number of questions from the Detailed Questionnaire that they ask based on position size, whether the position is a controlling interest, potential risks involved, and what change they are trying to drive in their portfolio and/or across the industry. Where the answer to any of the above questions is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk, please use parts or all of the below Detailed Questionnaire based on the responses to the Standard Questionnaire. The next article and final in this series presents a longer list of due diligence questions for asset owners to use if answers to any of the three Heightened Risk Scenario questions from the first article in this series is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk. Note: Special thanks to the organizations with team members who generously took the time to contribute to this work, listed here. The views of this series of articles should not be construed as reflecting the views of these organizations.

Title: How AMD’s AI Software Helped It Score The Multi-Billion Dollar OpenAI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/10/09/amd-openai-chip-software/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T10:30:05Z

ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Whenever Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AI at the chip giant AMD, gives CEO Lisa Su an update on the progress of the company’s software efforts, she always has the same response: “Great job. You need to go faster.” It may seem unusual for a semiconductor company to put such an emphasis on software, but that’s what unlocks the power of the coveted chips that undergird the AI industry. They coax better performance from the silicon and optimize functionality. They allow engineers to operate and program the hardware. More importantly, they’re sticky: when engineers at a company learn how to use a chipmaker’s software platform, they can be hard pressed to learn another. According to Boppana, software is part of what helped AMD to score one of the biggest victories in its more than 50 year history: a multibillion dollar deal that will see ChatGPT maker OpenAI use AMD’s MI450 chips to power 6 gigawatts of compute for its popular AI products. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will be able to buy up to 160 million shares, or 10%, of AMD. The partnership is a massive boon for AMD as it tries to catch up to market leader Nvidia. The foundation of the deal dates back to 2023 when OpenAI first began running some of its models on AMD hardware. In the ensuing years, AMD would seek the AI giant’s counsel on the design of its forthcoming MI450 chips. OpenAI has also influenced AMD’s software, Boppana told Forbes. “As our relationship with OpenAI deepened, we've expanded the engagements across all portions of stack, but certainly on the software side,” said Boppana. For example, AMD worked with OpenAI to make Triton, OpenAI’s open-source language for programming GPUs, compatible with AMD chips. (Previously, it only supported Nvidia GPUs.) “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia.” The AMD-OpenAI deal comes as demand for compute power has become almost insatiable. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank announced Project Stargate, a $500 billion investment in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure. Apple made a similar $500 billion commitment weeks later. The AI frenzy has turned Nvidia, previously mostly known for gaming chips, into a $4.5 trillion behemoth. Late last month, OpenAI entered into a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia to power 10 gigawatts of compute. Meanwhile, a new generation of semiconductor startups, including Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, and d-Matrix, have sought to develop specialized chips for the AI era, optimizing for those workloads instead of the more generalized approach favored by the legacy players. The explosion of AI services in the past few years means it won’t be winner-takes-all when it comes to compute power, said Sid Sheth, CEO of d-Matrix. “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia,” he told Forbes. “Customers are now willing to go through the process of learning what it takes to work with AMD’s software.” For Nvidia, software has long been seen by industry observers as a powerful tool to keep it entrenched in the market. CUDA, Nvidia’s programming software, for example, has created a formidable moat when it comes to training AI models. But when it comes to inference, or the computing it takes to actually run the models, the barrier is lower because it’s a less complicated process. And that’s what OpenAI plans to use the AMD chips for. “The moat is not as significant,” Sheth said. “The threshold of pain is coming down over time.” The sheer speed of the AI industry has also opened the door, Boppana argues. “If the world was kind of static and not evolving, and you just had lots of legacy software with the same architectures…then for sure, there is a big moat,” he said. But with AI, the pace of innovation is making the software to program chips easier to use. “On a forward-looking basis, I think it's going to be less and less important.” The OpenAI deal sees AMD now furlongs away from where it was in 2014 when Su took over. Back then, the company seemed to be on its last legs, with layoffs that nixed a quarter of the company and a stock price of around $2. (It’s stock is currently worth more than $235, with a market cap of $382 billion). AMD had missed the boat on mobile devices, and PC sales were lackluster. It was up to Su to preside over a turnaround and win data center business from hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. Now her goal is to make the company a true player in the next technological wave: artificial intelligence. “I think there’s another phase for AMD,” Su told Forbes in a 2023 cover story. “We had to prove that we were a good company. I think we’ve done that. Proving, again, that you’re great, and that you have a lasting legacy of what you’re contributing to the world, those are interesting problems for me.” If all goes well, the 6 gigawatt deployment could beget more such deals in the future. And becoming a go-to vendor for OpenAI might help to kickstart that new phase.

Elon Musk's massive Tesla pay package could see him earn billions without achieving revolutionary goals. Experts suggest easier targets, like modest vehicle sales and vague product definitions, could net him tens of billions. While the board claims the package is performance-based, an analysis reveals potential payouts far exceeding ambitious milestones, raising questions about true accountability.

Title: What Will It Take to Actually Get Alts in More Portfolios?

The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com It’s the first rule of finance: Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. While access to alternative assets is expected to broaden under the Trump administration’s Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Paul Atkins, mass affluent clients, and even advisors, aren’t overly familiar with the investments, including venture capital, infrastructure or real estate deals. The key to greater alt acceptance may lie in introducing them through more traditional products, like certain kinds of mutual funds and ETFs. “If you’re going to introduce a new asset class to the market, people will need time to become comfortable,” said Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute. “I’m not advocating for direct sales of private assets to retail, but using [40 Act] funds.” One way to introduce alts to retail investors or mass affluent clients is through target-date funds, Pan told Advisor Upside at a Financial Times conference in New York City this week. Such funds automatically adjust asset allocations over time and are already popular in 401(k)s. While alternatives often carry higher costs and potential risk, the biggest hurdle for retail investors is illiquidity, Pan said. “If it’s a piece of infrastructure, it may take you 20 years to build a bridge,” he said. “If it’s real estate, you can’t sell that overnight.” He suggested closed-end funds, which are less liquid by design, as another solution. Some firms are already using these vehicles to reach retail investors: Another big piece of the equation is transparency. If firms want to attract more clients to alternatives, private market products are going to have to become more transparent. “That’s a requirement to unlock everything else,” BlackRock COO Rob Goldstein said during a panel discussion at the conference. “The more transparency you provide on private markets, I actually think you’ll see an increase in allocation of capital to the private market.” Not So Fast. Some industry leaders remain skeptical, though. While PIMCO has launched private credit funds geared toward wealthy retail investors, company CEO Emmanuel Roman said the firm is “paranoid” about illiquidity risks, and that investors need to be compensated for locking up their investments long term. “You really have a burden of proof in terms of having a product, which delivers double-digit returns and offers what it says on the box in terms of liquidity,” he said during the conference. “It’s hard to make liquidity out of nowhere.” Advisors and clients haven’t been chasing returns, though, instead smartly choosing to stay diversified. Tax-law and human behavior are complicated, but there’s a method to mitigating past investment mistakes. In the long-running bull market, it’s not hard to make a case against risk-parity funds. But it’s harder to make one against Ray Dalio and his massive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. The opportunities to invest are expanding, but due diligence is key. Advisors are taking a variety of approaches in fixed income, stocks and alternatives. Allocations today have a striking resemblance to where they stood in 2023, according to new Goldman Sachs data. Investing $1 billion in T. Rowe may be more efficient for Goldman than building out its own channel. Mixing politics and investing is like mixing emotions and math: It rarely adds up. They’re going to have to adapt to not only younger clients’ approach to finances, but also their communication styles and social preferences. Rules-based investments are appealing, but even index-fund investing comes with limitations. With assets reaching new heights, advisors need to inform clients about what exchange-traded funds can — and can’t — do. The hype for expanded access to alternatives is real, but are they in the best interests of clients who may not understand how they work? © 2025 The Daily Upside

October 09, 2025 06:01 ET | Source: Akero Therapeutics Inc. Akero Therapeutics Inc. Shareholders to Receive $54 Per Share in Cash and CVR of $6 Per Share Advances Akero’s Mission of Bringing Novel Therapies to Patients with High Unmet Medical Needs SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (“Akero”) (Nasdaq: AKRO), a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”) for up to $5.2 billion in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, Akero shareholders will receive $54.00 per share in cash at closing and a non-transferable Contingent Value Right (“CVR”). Each CVR will entitle its holder to receive a cash payment of $6.00 per share upon full U.S. regulatory approval of efruxifermin (“EFX”) for treatment of compensated cirrhosis due to MASH by June 30, 2031. The upfront cash portion of the consideration represents an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion, a 19% premium to Akero’s 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and a 42% premium to Akero’s closing price on May 19, 2025 prior to market speculation. Combined, the upfront and potential contingent value payment represent, if achieved, an equity value of approximately $5.2 billion, a 32% premium to Akero’s 30-day VWAP, and a 57% premium to Akero’s closing price on May 19, 2025 prior to market speculation. Akero’s innovative EFX program – focused on developing a best-in-class treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”) – will complement Novo Nordisk’s leadership in GLP-1 based metabolic treatments. Novo Nordisk’s world leading capabilities in cardio-metabolic disease will enhance and accelerate evaluation of EFX in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program, preparation for a successful commercial launch, and delivery of EFX to patients in need around the globe. “We are excited to enter into this transaction with Novo Nordisk, which follows a comprehensive review undertaken by our Board of Directors, delivers meaningful value to Akero shareholders, and positions us to expand treatment options for people around the globe through Novo Nordisk’s industry-leading development capabilities and commercial infrastructure,” said Andrew Cheng, M.D., Ph.D, President and CEO of Akero Therapeutics. “I want to thank Akero’s talented employees for their tireless commitment to advancing EFX and meeting a critical global unmet need. We look forward to joining the Novo Nordisk family and accelerating the momentum of EFX to deliver a transformational impact on patients’ lives.” The transaction has been unanimously approved by Akero’s Board of Directors and is expected to close around year-end, subject to approval by Akero shareholders and upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions including approvals by regulatory authorities. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as financial advisors to Akero Therapeutics, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP as its legal advisor. About Akero TherapeuticsAkero Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Akero’s lead product candidate, efruxifermin (EFX), is currently being evaluated in three ongoing Phase 3 clinical studies: SYNCHRONY Histology in patients with pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3 fibrosis) MASH, SYNCHRONY Outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH, and SYNCHRONY Real-World in patients with MASH or MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease). The Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program builds on the results of two Phase 2b clinical trials, the HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH and the SYMMETRY study in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to MASH. Akero is headquartered in South San Francisco. Visit us at Akerotx.com and follow us on LinkedIn and X for more information. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. As of August 2025, Novo Nordisk employed about 78,400 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. Novo Nordisk’s B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (NOVO-B). Its ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NVO). For more information, visit novonordisk.com, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube. About EFX and the SYNCHRONY programEFX, Akero’s lead product candidate, is currently being evaluated in three ongoing phase 3 trials. In multiple phase 2 trials, EFX has been observed to reverse fibrosis (including compensated cirrhosis), resolve MASH, reduce non-invasive markers of fibrosis and liver injury, and improve insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein profile. This holistic profile offers the potential to address the complex, multi-system disease state of all stages of MASH, including improvements in risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease – the leading cause of death among MASH patients. Engineered to mimic the biological activity profile of native FGF21, EFX is designed to offer once-weekly subcutaneous dosing and has been generally well-tolerated in clinical trials to date. The ongoing global phase 3 SYNCHRONY program (total ~3,500 participants) is comprised of three, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of EFX in both compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH.

(Akero), a publicly held clinical-stage company developing innovative treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by a high unmet medical need. Akero’s fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogue efruxifermin (EFX) is a potentially best-in-class treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). EFX is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of patients with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (F2-F3) and patients with cirrhosis (F4). Strategic and portfolio fitThe acquisition reflects Novo Nordisk’s long-term strategy to develop innovative and differentiated medicines and treat millions of more people living with diabetes, obesity and their associated comorbidities. With more than 40% of MASH patients also having type 2 diabetes, and over 80% of MASH patients being overweight or living with obesity, MASH is closely linked with Novo Nordisk’s expertise in diabetes and obesity. “MASH destroys lives silently - and efruxifermin has the potential to change that by reversing liver damage,” said Mike Doustdar, President and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “If approved, we believe it could become a cornerstone therapy, alone or together with Wegovy® (semaglutide), to tackle one of the fastest-growing metabolic diseases of our time. This acquisition embodies Novo Nordisk’s relentless ambition to move faster, go further, and ultimately deliver on our commitment to pursue leadership in diabetes, obesity and their associated comorbidities.” EFX is currently being evaluated as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection in the phase 3 SYNCHRONY programme, which consists of three clinical trials designed to support regulatory approval for the treatment of pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH and compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH. The phase 3 programme builds on two 96-week phase 2b trials, in which EFX has been observed to significantly improve liver fibrosis and reverse compensated cirrhosis due to MASH. Over 96 weeks, the HARMONY (F2-F3) and SYMMETRY (F4) trial demonstrated 49% and 29% reduction in fibrosis without worsening of MASH respectively, compared to 19% and 11% in the respective placebo groups1. EFX is the only treatment to have shown significant fibrosis regression in F4 patients in a phase 2 trial. “Efruxifermin complements Novo Nordisk’s leading portfolio and is aligned with our commitment to building a competitive portfolio of treatment options across the stages of MASH. Within MASH, there remains a huge medical need for effective treatment options, especially in the later stages of the disease,” said Martin Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research & Development at Novo Nordisk. “Based on the data generated by Akero, we believe efruxifermin could be a first- and best-in-class treatment for mid- to late-stage MASH with the potential to reverse liver damage. Novo Nordisk is uniquely positioned to unlock the full potential of efruxifermin and reach more patients living with MASH.” Transaction termsUnder the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk will acquire all outstanding shares of Akero’s common stock at a price of 54 USD per share in cash (or aggregated value of 4.7 billion USD) at closing. In addition, Akero shareholders will receive a non-transferable CVR entitling holders to a potential additional payment of 6 USD per share in cash (or aggregated value of 0.5 billion USD) upon US regulatory approval of EFX for the treatment of compensated cirrhosis due to MASH. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Akero’s Board of Directors and is expected to close around the turn of the year, upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions including approvals by regulatory authorities. Novo Nordisk is represented by BofA Securities as its financial advisor and Ropes & Gray as its legal advisor. Financial implicationsThe transaction is not expected to impact Novo Nordisk’s previously communicated operating profit outlook for 2025. The free cash flow outlook for 2025 is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 4 billion USD, reflecting the expected enterprise value at closing. The implied 2025 free cash flow outlook is therefore 9-19 billion DKK depending on the timing of closing. For 2026, the acquisition is expected to lead to increased research and development costs, with an estimated negative impact on full year operating profit growth in 2026 of around 3%-points, depending on the timing of closing. The transaction will be mainly debt financed. Conference callNovo Nordisk will host a conference call for investors at 14.00 CEST on 9 October 2025, corresponding to 8:00 am EDT. A dial-in link to the conference call will be published on the investor section of novonordisk.com. About EFX and the SYNCHRONY programmeEFX, Akero’s lead product candidate, is currently being evaluated in three ongoing phase 3 trials. In multiple phase 2 trials, EFX has been observed to reverse fibrosis (including compensated cirrhosis), resolve MASH, reduce non-invasive markers of fibrosis and liver injury, and improve insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein profile. This holistic profile offers the potential to address the complex, multi-system disease state of all stages of MASH, including improvements in risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease – the leading cause of death among MASH patients. Engineered to mimic the biological activity profile of native FGF21, EFX is designed to offer once-weekly subcutaneous dosing and has been generally well-tolerated in clinical trials to date. The ongoing global phase 3 SYNCHRONY programme (total ~3,500 participants) is comprised of three, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of EFX in both compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH. About MASHMASH is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people are estimated to live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. MASH is characterised by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver that causes stress and injury to liver cells, leading to inflammation and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and eventually death. Approximately 20% of patients with MASH will progress to cirrhosis, which has a higher risk of mortality. There are few approved treatments for the condition and MASH is the fastest-growing cause of liver transplants and liver cancer in the US and Europe. About Akero TherapeuticsAkero Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including MASH. Akero was founded in 2017, currently has around 75 employees and is headquartered in San Francisco. Akero Therapeutics’ shares are listed on the Nasdaq-GS exchange under trading symbol AKRO. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Title: Why Wall Street Analysts Say We’re Not in an AI Bubble… Yet

A spate of unusual deals within the AI ecosystem has recently fueled concern that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble, but some professional market watchers say this isn't 1999—at least not yet. OpenAI has vowed to spend hundreds of billions on Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips; in exchange, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI, and OpenAI will invest in AMD. Nvidia has invested in cloud providers Nebius (NBIS) and CoreWeave (CRWV), both of which buy its chips, and agreed with the latter to buy all of its unused computing capacity through 2032. These deals are just a few threads in a growing web of entanglements connecting chipmakers, cloud providers and AI model makers. Artificial intelligence excitement has been the main driver of stock market returns for the past three years, increasing the weight of big tech stocks in most portfolios. Until companies can demonstrate AI is contributing to the bottom line, the AI rally will depend on investors remaining optimistic about future returns. Skeptics warn these circular deals are evidence of an artificial intelligence bubble forming. They argue that Nvidia, through investments in the companies buying and renting its chips, is subsidizing the AI build-out, and artificially overstating the strength of AI demand in the process. But many on Wall Street disagree, including analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, who cast doubt on the bubble narrative in notes published Wednesday. “We believe the recent concerns re AI financing are highly overstated,” wrote BofA semiconductor equity analyst Vivek Arya, who doesn’t expect circular deals to account for more than 5% to 10% of the $5 trillion that is likely to be spent on AI by 2030. Though, it’s worth noting that by BofA’s calculation, OpenAI will have to spend between $500 and $600 billion on infrastructure as part of its Nvidia deal alone; add in its commitments to AMD and Oracle (ORCL), and the startup has agreed to spend about $1 trillion on cloud computing in the coming years. OpenAI’s centrality to the recent spate of deals has concerned some onlookers. The ChatGPT maker recently became the world’s most valuable startup, valued at $500 billion, and is in the process of becoming a for-profit company. Still, it anticipates burning through $115 billion on the road to profitability, which isn’t expected to happen until the end of this decade at the earliest. However, Arya notes that OpenAI, while a big player in the AI boom, is “only one of multiple (5-10) ecosystems including the four large US hyperscalers, Tesla/xAI, multiple sovereign buildouts (Middle East, Asia), 100+ neoclouds that do not require or have disclosed minimal vendor financing.” Skeptics have repeatedly pointed to the stock prices of the Magnificent Seven—Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—as evidence of a burgeoning bubble. The ten largest companies in the U.S., including all of the Mag 7, cumulatively account for a quarter of global equity market value. “This degree of concentration is, in our view, unsustainable,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Wednesday, “but this is not the same as saying that we are experiencing a bubble.” Goldman identifies three common components of financial bubbles: “rapidly rising asset prices, extreme valuations and rising significant systemic risks driven by increased leverage.” While the Mag 7 stocks have soared over the past three years, Goldman notes that their valuations remain modest compared with the lead up to the Dotcom bubble, in part because their stock prices reflect “powerful and sustained profit growth rather than excessive speculation about the future.” Another difference between then and now is that the companies fueling the AI boom with their spending have unusually strong balance sheets, cash flows and hugely profitable businesses not tied to AI. That has allowed them to fund their buildouts with existing revenue streams rather than equity and debt, which reduces the risk that a sudden shock to the AI ecosystem halts AI investment, forces a sharp revaluation of related assets, and ripples through the broader economy. Though, Goldman concedes that, while we’re not currently in a bubble, a few developing trends suggest we’re headed there. Big tech’s debt issuance picked up this year as cash reserves dwindled, suggesting systemic risk may be increasing. More companies have gone public to cash in on the AI frenzy, and investors have eaten the new offerings up. “The starting day premiums for new issues has reached an average of 30% in the US,” the highest since the Dotcom bubble, according to Goldman.

Title: Battle over Elon Musk’s trillionaire pay package builds as pension funds face off against Tesla

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla is weeks away from a monumental shareholder vote on CEO Elon Musk’s potential $1 trillion pay package at its annual investor meeting, and the EV maker is pulling out all the stops to push the measure through. Last year, Tesla rallied thousands of mom-and-pop retail investors to vote their shares of stock in favor of Musk’s billions in pay. Now, Tesla is teeing up retail holders for another vote on Nov. 6 that would set Musk on the path to becoming the world’s first trillionaire by granting him up to 12% of Tesla’s outstanding shares divided into 12 tranches through a restricted stock grant. The first tranche starts at $2 trillion, and the final tranche is $8.5 trillion. If he hits all the goals in the plan, he’ll have brought Tesla to a market cap of $8.5 trillion, and his stake would be worth more than $1 trillion. Much of the playbook for 2025 is similar to 2024: a slick investor website, a bevy of posts, and engagement on X about how investors can vote shares on specific brokerage platforms, and even a special video with Optimus humanoid robots explaining voting in between taking a sauna and overseeing platters of bagels and cream cheese. Tesla’s Annual Meeting is coming up on November 6 & we need your vote!Voting is quick and easy – you can vote online, by mail, by QR code or by phone@Tesla_Optimus can show you how pic.twitter.com/OM5UwtkJWx— Tesla (@Tesla) October 6, 2025 Tesla is clearly dedicating resources to communicating with its individual retail investors and informing them about how to vote, independent activist investor Michael Levin told Fortune, a feat that is difficult to accomplish in the U.S. Given how Tesla pulled it off last year, this year’s vote to approve Musk’s new award isn’t nearly as in doubt as it was in 2024, he said. Plus, Tesla has the same playbook to work from this year. “The result of 2024 gives a very strong clue about how 2025 will work out—and that passed with 72% of voters supporting it, and that’s pretty comfortable,” Levin said. “This year, it’s sort of a version of the same thing: A comp plan going forward with these insane, ambitious goals, and people are fine with that and don’t mind him being a trillionaire.” Thousands of retail investors and Tesla loyalists have pledged their support in favor of Tesla and Musk’s stratospheric new pay plan, but a growing coalition of pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are speaking out about what they see as red flags: a comp package that is too large, a lack of independence on the board, and the potential for other founders and controlling CEOs to follow in Musk’s footsteps. The latter would be disastrous for an economy that is already tilted too favorably in the direction of billionaires like Musk while employees writ large are battling inflation and lackluster pay raises, sources said. “It’s not only the magnitude, it’s the way in which the pay package is sort of a ransom aimed at shareholders,” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander told Fortune. “It’s a megalomaniacal trip of bizarre proportions that is all about Elon’s ego and not about the financial health of the company or its stakeholders and shareholders.” Lander, who signed a letter with other investors urging shareholders to vote against Musk’s pay plan and to oppose the reelection of three Tesla board members, oversees more than $1 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of New York City’s pension funds. Similarly, New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees about $1.4 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of the state’s pension funds, called Musk’s pay “excessive,” and said it “waters down the holdings of other shareholders, and gives a captive board unwarranted discretion.” DiNapoli said he plans in coming weeks to lobby other investors to vote against the plan and all directors with reelection bids on the board. The vote will be a pivotal moment—not just for Tesla, but for all those who oversee invested assets on behalf of shareholders and retirees, New Mexico State Treasurer Laura Montoya told Fortune. “If we don’t hold them accountable you’re going to have so many others who are going to try and follow suit,” Montoya said. “This is a precedent that could be damaging to our economy, not just today and tomorrow but in our children’s future.” The Tesla meeting agenda includes investor votes on 14 proposals, but the two that are keenly relevant to Musk’s compensation include a proposal to approve his 2025 CEO performance award, and a second proposal that would include the creation of a special reserve of 208 million equity shares for Musk. The vote authorizing more shares will also replenish the equity pool of 60 million shares available for employees and directors that companies typically use to compensate executives. “All the action is in those two proposals,” said Levin, who holds a small investment in Tesla and plans to oppose the pay proposals. The pay plan up for a vote this year comes after a Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s previous moonshot award in January 2024, a decision that prompted Tesla to hold an investor vote to ratify his pay package a second time in 2024 and to authorize a move from being incorporated in the state of Delaware to Texas. The 2024 ratification vote and the move to Texas were enormous victories for the EV maker, even though the same Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s pay package a second time following the vote. Since then, the Tesla board has given Musk an interim award of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $24 billion. Musk’s proposed 2025 award involves the CEO hitting both market capitalization and operational goals that could potentially see Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion if Musk successfully unlocks all 12 tranches. He’ll have to stick around at Tesla for a minimum of 7.5 years and up to 10 years for his shares to vest. The board claimed during negotiations that Musk “raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests” if he does not get paid for his past work at Tesla and receive at least a 25% voting interest in the company. The new award requires him to “participate in the board’s development of a framework for long-term CEO succession,” one of the provisions states. All told, Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire, and he would hold 28.8% of Tesla if he hits all the goals in the moonshot plan. He would also become the first and only CEO to hit a moonshot hat trick—three back-to-back pay packages. The Tesla board told investors the pay package is key to keeping Musk focused on Tesla and motivated to grow the company. “In light of the AI talent wars, Tesla’s internal efforts to develop and expand its product offerings within the AI industry, the absence of a comprehensive plan to address the compensation that remains outstanding for Musk’s past performance, and the lack of any go-forward incentive to motivate Musk to keep his focus aimed at Tesla long enough to achieve meaningful results that will transform Tesla over the long term, we believe there is a pressing need to retain and incentivize Musk immediately,” the board told investors last month. In their criticisms, pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are taking aim not only at the size of Musk’s potential pay package but the Tesla board, chaired by Robyn Denholm. Pension leaders have said Denholm and the board are letting investors down by failing to properly oversee and challenge Musk when needed and ensure that he stays focused on Tesla. “In our view, the board’s failure to limit Mr. Musk’s outside endeavors while rewarding him with unprecedented pay packages for only a part-time commitment strongly indicates a lack of true independence by management and jeopardizes long-term shareholder value,” states a letter from SOC Investment Group, signed by a dozen fiduciaries and investors. “The board has permitted Mr. Musk to be overcommitted for years, allowing him to continue as CEO while taking time-consuming leadership roles at his other companies, xAI/X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company.” The letter noted that the level of compensation paid to the Tesla board members could also compromise the board’s impartiality. Average comp paid to S&P 500 board members in 2024 was $327,096, the letter states. Denholm’s average compensation per year has been $62 million. Denholm has repeatedly denied that her objectivity has been clouded by the wealth she’s made selling Tesla stock over the years. Still, some investors are planning to send a message to the board by voting against the three directors up for reelection this year: Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman told Fortune her concerns about Tesla as a fiduciary were based on the board’s governing track record and the lack of accountability by directors overseeing Musk in his role as CEO. “This is one of those circumstances where somebody has to say, ‘Enough is enough,’” said Lierman. Despite the organizing by pension funds, the battle to sway the vote is an uphill climb, although that is no reason not to speak out, noted Lierman. Tesla appears positioned to win approval of Musk’s new moonshot pay plan based on Musk’s ownership, the voting history of large institutional investors, and the company’s track record with individual holders. According to the proxy statement, owned by Musk—and his brother and board colleague Kimbal Musk—can be voted for the two key comp proposals. Meaning there is no majority-of-minority requirement, a corporate governance mechanism where a transaction or proposal has to be approved by a majority of shareholders who are not involved in the transaction. Currently, Musk holds about 20% of the company, and Kimbal Musk holds about 1.5 million shares, less than 1% of Tesla’s outstanding stock. In addition, large institutional investors BlackRock and Vanguard hold close to 13% of Tesla between them, and both voted in favor of Musk’s pay ratification in 2024. According to FactSet, retail shareholders equate to approximately 34% of outstanding shares. Last year’s ratification vote saw 72% of all votes cast in approval of his pay, which excluded shares connected to Musk and his brother. Given the level of insider control plus Tesla’s command over its retail base, proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis aren’t going to be a determinant even if they recommend investors oppose the pay proposals, said Levin. Similarly, BlackRock and Vanguard don’t disclose their votes in advance, but they may not be much of an issue even if they suddenly reverse course on Musk’s pay this year versus last year. Still, Musk is unlikely to leave anything to chance, said Levin, given his ownership stake in Tesla. And if Musk left Tesla it would be terrible for investors; the stock would likely immediately plummet. “Maybe it’s a risk this board doesn’t want to take,” said Levin. “But I think the cost of avoiding that risk is way too high—it’s a trillion dollars of equity.” Tesla’s shareholder meeting is slated to take place on Nov. 6 at its headquarters in Austin. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Asian shares were mostly higher on Thursday after US stocks hit records again following a brief stumble. Markets in mainland China gained more than 1% as they reopened following a weeklong holiday, while U.S. futures were mixed. Oil prices fell back, then recovered to trade flat after Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to pause fighting in Gaza so that the remaining hostages there can be freed in the coming days in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The acceptance of elements of a plan put forward by the Trump administration represents the biggest breakthrough in months in the devastating two-year-old war and reduced risks in the volatile region. U.S. benchmark crude added 2 cents to $62.57 per barrel as of Thursday afternoon. Brent crude, the international standard, edged up 4 cents to $66.29 per barrel. Gold shed some of its stellar gains but was still at $4,055.80 per ounce as of Thursday afternoon. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8% to 48,572.67. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged over 11% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged down less than 0.1% to 26,821.93, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.2% to 3,929.32 in its first trading session since Oct. 1. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up nearly 0.3% to 8,969.80 while Taiwan's Taiex pared earlier bigger gains, closing 0.9% higher. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, on Thursday reported its third-quarter revenue climbed 30% year-on-year, beating market forecasts. Its shares gained 1.8%. On Wednesday, Wall Street resumed climbing and the price of gold pushed further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,735.72, another record, a day after snapping a seven-day winning streak.

Title: Crypto-Focused AMINA Bank of Switzerland Offers Regulated Staking of Polygon Token
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/09/crypto-focused-amina-bank-of-switzerland-offers-regulated-staking-of-polygon-token
Time Published: 2025-10-09T07:19:35Z

Swiss-regulated crypto bank AMINA has become the first bank worldwide to offer institutional clients regulated staking access to POL, the native token that powers the Polygon blockchain. The launch allows qualified participants, including asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting network security in compliance with financial regulations. As part of this collaboration, AMINA clients can receive up to 15% in staking rewards. This rate combines AMINA’s base yield with an additional incentive from the foundation. The move expands the bank’s existing POL custody and trading services, giving institutions a compliant path to participate in blockchain infrastructure relied on by firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton for their tokenization efforts. Myles Harrison, AMINA’s chief product officer, said the service bridges traditional finance with “the networks that matter.” AMINA Bank (previously known as SEBA Bank) holds a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and also has nods to offer crypto services from regulators in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron called the development a sign that institutions “aren’t just buying tokens anymore — they want to participate.” Polygon, an Ethereum overlay blockchain which processes transactions for less than a cent and settles them in under five seconds, has become one of the main networks for on-chain finance. It now hosts over $1 billion in tokenized real-world assets and nearly $3 billion in stablecoin value. The POL token had a market cap of $2.5 billion at press time.

World shares are mostly higher after US stocks hit records again following a brief stumble MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — European shares were mixed in early trading while most Asian stocks rose on Thursday after U.S. stocks hit records again following a brief stumble. The futures for S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up less than 0.1%, while markets in mainland China gained more than 1% as they reopened following a weeklong holiday. In early European trading, Germany's Dax added 0.2% to 24,634.96 while France's CAC 40 was almost flat at 8,062.13. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.4% to 9,507.00 as sentiments were weighed by banking and housing stocks. Oil prices fell back, then slightly recovered after Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to pause fighting in Gaza so that the remaining hostages there can be freed in the coming days in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The acceptance of elements of a plan put forward by the Trump administration represents the biggest breakthrough in months in the devastating two-year-old war and reduced risks in the volatile region. U.S. benchmark crude added 12 cents to $62.67 per barrel as of Thursday afternoon. Brent crude, the international standard, edged up 12 cents to $66.37 per barrel. Gold shed some of its stellar gains but was still at $4,051.80 per ounce as of Thursday afternoon. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8%, closing at 48,580.44. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged over 11% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged down 0.3% to 26,740.37, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.3% to 3,933.97 in its first trading session since Oct. 1. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up nearly 0.3% to 8,969.80 while Taiwan's Taiex pared earlier bigger gains, closing 0.9% higher. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, on Thursday reported its third-quarter revenue climbed 30% year-on-year, beating market forecasts. Its shares gained 2.1%. On Wednesday, Wall Street resumed climbing and the price of gold pushed further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,735.72, another record, a day after snapping a seven-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged less than 0.1% lower to 46,601.78, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to its own record of 23,043.38.

Title: Finn McRedmond: Forget VAT. Delivery apps are killing our restaurants
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/10/09/finn-mcredmond-the-more-takeaways-we-order-the-more-miserable-we-become/

Call the social scientists. I propose a new method for tracking the social health of society and it’s called The Takeaway Index. It suggests that the moral status of the nation is tightly correlated with the amount of time we spend ordering food via apps on our smartphones. I think it stands up against accepted scientific methods. This is, conveniently, rather good news for me. I have ordered just one takeaway in 2025. It was Monday, June 30th. I had returned from Glastonbury after a seven-hour trip home, husk-like, to an empty fridge. I scrolled through Uber Eats and ordered chicken, broccoli and some pickled cabbage, in repentance for the hedonism of recent days. I felt immediate guilt, not because it was going to be disgusting, but because I know delivery apps are wreaking havoc on the restaurant industry. Forgive the moralising (it’s just dinner), but your beloved local trattoria’s life depends on it. In the first quarter of 2025, 150 restaurants in Ireland closed. Six-hundred restaurants, cafes and hospitality businesses closed in the 12 months from September, 2023. This is a crisis and if the impersonal data doesn’t do it for you, then look to your main street. Near to where I grew up, Gareth Smith’s restaurant, Big Mike’s (in Blackrock, Co Dublin), has been forced to shutter. The economics of the industry are “insurmountable”, he explained. Allow me to acknowledge the cost-of-living crisis and all the hardship it places on the consumer. Regular dinner out is an extravagance beyond many. A fish pie for €20 is not trivial pocket change. With that out of the way, now turn your eyes to this staggering figure reported by RTÉ this summer: we spend €2.2 billion a year on takeaways. Restaurants are caught in a nasty doom loop. They were once reliant on the likes of Uber Eats or Deliveroo to survive, but those are now among the factors making brick-and-mortar restaurants less viable. There are other things at play of course, but this part of the story is too often overlooked. During the pandemic, restaurants relied on these delivery apps to reach their customers. It was a vicious cycle; customers became too used to takeaways and restaurants grew too reliant on takeaway apps. Now, in 2025, not enough people are eating out. Or, as UCC professor Ronan Carbery puts it in a piece for RTÉ, “delivery platforms transformed from pandemic lifelines into structural threats”. The Government is listening. Tuesday’s budget announced VAT on “food businesses” will reduce from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent from next summer. This might dig hospitality out of the grave, but only if those in search of dinner are willing to give up their Uber Eats account too. “It’s actually much more complicated than that.” These are the words I hear from the more annoying among you. Isn’t single-cause history out of fashion? All well and good, but this is not about the multifaceted source of hospitality’s malaise. Rising wages, cost of produce, hostile rental markets – these are all problems too. But what we are witnessing beyond the economic analysis is a much more troubling directional trend. And we have always been able to learn a lot about the world by looking at how it decides to eat. Last I heard, society is more atomised than ever – polarised, miserable, with nasty populists in the wings and surrounded by a truculent electorate. The isolating power of the smartphone turns out to be even greater than we ever imagined – as young people in particular while away their hours, and thus their lives, scrolling through endless amounts of slop. This radicalises some and makes loners out of others. Meanwhile, everyone wants to sit inside and order a pizza to their front door from an app. Breaking bread might be the most ancient practice, slowly being lost to the lure of the smartphone. Ordering food off an app is a symptom of this bigger sickness. Just like the decline in shared community activities like sports teams and bridge clubs, the retreat inside to eat dinner on the sofa is part of this social atomisation. But it is a cause of the isolating spiral too. As fewer people want to be – or can afford to be – in shared places like restaurants, is it any wonder that everyone has forgotten what is nice about it in the first place? This is a self-sustaining crash-out. I’ve glanced into the future and it is a grim place where the dimly-lit wine bar serving pan-European small plates is closed. Also closed are the robust kitchens serving trad-hibernian fare, the seafood bars on Dublin’s south coast and West Cork’s shores. We have ceded our appetites to middlemen at Silicon Valley mega-corps. We demand lunch in a box handed to us by a low-wage gig-economy worker. All the while the local restaurant was just around the corner, begging for your custom. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elm Park offices present opportunity for offices and healthcare investors
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/elm-park-offices-present-opportunity-for-offices-and-healthcare-investors/a1420248835.html
Time Published: 2025-10-09T04:30:00Z

Block A at Elm Park With office deals increasing in both the lettings and sales markets, the launch of Block A at Elm Park, Dublin 4, along with the adjoining annex, presents an interesting opportunity for investors and owner occupiers. It also reflects how keen pricing has become for Dublin offices. Agent TWM is guiding in the region of €18.5m for the entire block which is equivalent to €1,744 per square metre – whereas to develop the same block at current prices could cost more than double that, at €4,198 per square metre. Block A is a modern seven-storey office building extending to about 72,000sqft with an adjoining smaller building known as the annex, extending to about 10,000sqft. The sale includes 76 secure basement car spaces. Currently the lot generates annual rent of €1.32m and there is potential to increase that by letting out two vacant floors extending to 29,000sqft which can be accessed via individual entrances. Strategic risk management firms Willis Towers Watson has a lease on four floors accounting for 60pc of the building and they are paying about €1.2m in rent. Recent figures for the Dublin office market saw increased activity when 822,000sqft of office space was leased across 61 deals during the three months to the end of September. That was the highest number of transactions in a quarter since the third quarter of 2018. Recovery in office demand was also reflected in the investment market, where offices accounted for 35pc of deal volume, across 12 deals. Michele Jackson of TWM also says Elm Park could also appeal to purchasers and occupiers in the healthcare sector, partly because its basement is built to double height level, which is designed to accommodate ambulances. “The 2024 strategic acquisition by the HSE of its Elm Park Green portfolio for approximately €50m is understood to have triggered a broader interest in this location from investors seeking a value add/alternative use play as well as from the immediate healthcare sector.” The HSE acquisition comprised 275,000sqft of accommodation across two buildings which included the vacant Seamark building, extending to approximately 180,000sqft. The acquisition will support cost-effective and expedient delivery of healthcare accommodation in line with the most recent Programme for Government. Elm Park is a prime Dublin 4 location adjacent to St Vincent’s public and private hospitals and 2kms from Blackrock Health. The development has generous secure basement parking and easy access to bus and Dart public transport. Ms Jackson says that “The location is likely to appeal to both investors and owner occupiers looking to buy into sectors poised for growth.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Six Mag 7 Stocks Failed To Hit New Highs Wednesday As Indexes Did So

ByJohn Navin, Contributor. That these Mag 7 stocks could not make it up to new highs while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 hit their new highs is peculiar. It’s the type of negative divergence that probably attracts the attention of Wall Street algorithms designed to be on the lookout for such things and to react according to their highly attuned programming. Alphabet The stock hit a peak of $255 in mid-September, sold off, rallied briefly and now trades for $244. No new high. The upward angle of the 50-day moving average is unusually strong. Today’s close is far above the 200-day moving average. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Alphabet has a market capitalization of $2401.95. Amazon The stock peaked in February at just above $240 (not seen on this chart). The early September re-test of that level failed. Today’s closing price was just above $220, just under the 50-day moving average. It appears as if Amazon has now tested the level of the 200-day moving average and managed to remain above it. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Market cap is $2401.95 billion. Broadcom The semiconducter giant hit a high of near $370 in early September. Today’s price closed the session at $345. It’s a sign of some weakness that Broadcom is unable to make it up to the old high on a day when the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 both hit new highs. Broadcom’s market cap is $1631.58 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 88. Meta The peak at near $800 arrived in August and the stock now goes for $717. An attempted retest of the previous high came in mid-September and failed. Meta Platforms now has nine closing days below the 50-day moving average. Mark Zuckerberg’s internet content company has a market cap of $1803.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 26. Netflix The stock peaked in late June up there just above $1325 and has since declined to today’s closing price of $1214. It seems to be magnetized since early August to the 50-day moving average. Netflix has a market cap of $515.97 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 51.74. Tesla The stock peaked on the first day of October at $470 and today closed at $438 – no new high here for CEO Elon Musk and friends. The 50-day moving average in September crossed above the 200-day moving average, so there’s that. Whether the momentum can be regained remains to be seen. Market cap is $1458.71 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 254. For comparison’s sake, here are the daily price charts for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 aka “the major indexes:” S&P 500 It’s a new high today, just barely. The peak is a bit clearer on the hourly chart, but it’s definitely there. Nasdaq 100 Today’s new high here is clear as a bell. Apple is the one Mag 7 name that managed a new high today.

Title: Commentary: Is Hong Kong’s comeback for the world or for China?

Commentary As China prepares for a key meeting to discuss its next five-year plan, repositioning Hong Kong must take focus, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. File photo of people crossing a street during busy evening traffic in Central Hong Kong. (Photo: AFP/Mladen Antonov) This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: Just a few years ago, many outsiders had written Hong Kong off. The violent protests of 2019, followed by the imposition of a national security law in 2020 and strict COVID-19 restrictions, triggered a mass exodus of local and foreign talent and capital. Professionals and firms fled to safer havens like Singapore, while others sought refuge in New York and London, leaving the city economically battered and demographically hollowed out. Yet, in a striking turnaround, Hong Kong is staging a robust comeback - albeit one fraught with inconsistencies. The city's stock markets have surged back to prominence, fuelled by Beijing's economic stimulus measures unveiled in September 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, the city raised HK$107.1 billion (US$13.7 billion) through initial public offerings (IPOs) - seven times the amount from the same period in 2024. PwC forecasts that 2025 will mark Hong Kong's most active IPO market in four years, with fundraising expected to claim the global number one spot. Much of this momentum is being driven by mainland Chinese firms, which account for around 60 per cent of the over 2,600 companies listed in Hong Kong, as well as more than 80 per cent of total market capitalisation. Government incentives have also drawn hundreds of thousands of Chinese talents from the mainland and overseas. The latest vindication came last month when Hong Kong supplanted Singapore as Asia's premier destination for attracting talent and rocketed to fourth place worldwide in the IMD World Talent Ranking - its highest-ever position. This resurgence, however, feels lopsided on the ground. The streets are bustling, and the vibrancy is unmistakable. Tourism footfall is up, especially from mainland China, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s visitor arrivals between January and August. But boarded-up storefronts tell another story. High rents and competition from cheaper cross-border alternatives have hit parts of the retail and restaurant segments hard, even as other sectors, for example jewellery and watches typically favoured by tourists - thrive. Beneath this uneven recovery looms a larger, strategic question: Is Hong Kong rebounding to reclaim its cherished mantle as Asia's World City - a cosmopolitan powerhouse akin to New York or London - or is it morphing into China's World City, a specialised outpost serving the mainland's ambitions? The answer will dictate everything from investment flows and urban planning to cultural identity and global relevance. Since 2001, Hong Kong has leaned heavily into its "Asia's World City" branding, spotlighting its prowess in financial services, trade, tourism, transport and communications. This narrative positioned the city as a vibrant, rule-of-law bastion bridging East and West. But the past five years have upended that vision, amid escalating US-China tensions. Perceptions have shifted dramatically; serious doubts now swirl about whether Hong Kong is devolving into "just another Chinese city". This unease stems partly from the territory's political elite, who have increasingly embraced mainland-style rhetoric and governance practices. Over the last two years, Beijing has exhorted the city to prioritise economic growth, leveraging its unique perch as a capitalist enclave under the "one country, two systems" framework. Yet Hong Kong grapples with striking a delicate equilibrium between security and development, and between deeper integration into the mainland economy and its role as a regional hub for international business. Recent flashpoints underscore the tension. In March 2025, state-backed media unleashed blistering criticism against tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings for its plan to sell strategic Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by US financial behemoth BlackRock, branding the move a "betrayal" and "spineless capitulation". Similarly, early this month, Beijing's top diplomat in Hong Kong warned the newly arrived US Consul General Julie Eadeh against "colluding with anti-China forces", after she met with local civil society figures. Contrary to fears that Hong Kong would be collateral damage in the US-China showdown, its liminal "in-between" status is proving a surprising asset. The mainland stimulus not only juiced stocks but also amplified Hong Kong's appeal as a conduit for global capital into China. Looking ahead, the city stands to gain from cross-border talent flows. In the US, President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on elite universities like Harvard and restrictions on foreign scholars have unnerved Chinese students and scientists, many of whom view Hong Kong as a lifeline. Its capitalist ethos, English common law, and open access to Western platforms like Google and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland, make it an alluring alternative. Beijing's blessings have supercharged this trend. Hong Kong's talent admission schemes, offering low taxes and top-tier international schools, have magnetised mainland professionals eager for global exposure while securing better futures for their children. Since 2022, these programmes have fielded nearly 500,000 applications, approving over 330,000 and welcoming more than 230,000 arrivals. The government's back-patting as an "international talent hub" rings somewhat hollow though, as the vast majority hail from the mainland, raising eyebrows about diversity and true global pull. These newcomers will undoubtedly invigorate the economy, restoring the frenetic energy of old. But they also fuel anxieties over whether Hong Kong can preserve its status as an international business nexus amid ballooning geopolitical friction. Officials have pivoted toward forging economic ties with Middle Eastern powerhouses and Belt and Road Initiative partners, with Dubai and Qatar emerging as favoured haunts. This shift isn't whimsical: US sanctions on senior figures, including Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, have hamstrung outreach to traditional business partners like the US, UK, and Europe, forcing a reorientation. The result? Apprehensions that Hong Kong is settling for a diminished role - a regional player on par with Dubai - rather than reclaiming its perch as a global financial titan rivalling New York and London. As China's leaders convene imminently to chart the 2026-2030 Five-Year Plan against a backdrop of roiling geopolitics, repositioning Hong Kong must rise to the fore. It needs to make the city indispensable to China’s modernisation and equally indispensable to global capital seeking exposure to China and Asia. To deliver that dual indispensability, Hong Kong must navigate these currents with nuance - honouring Beijing's directives while safeguarding the openness that once defined it as Asia's unrivalled world city.

An AI chipmaker's stock extended its rally in the wake of a major artificial intelligence deal. Meanwhile, the latest salvo in an escalating competition between credit score providers weighed on one of the industry's big players. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to set fresh closing highs, bolstered by gains in the tech sector and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggesting the central bank could be on track toward more interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow was little changed. Find Investopedia's full daily market recap here. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares posted the day's best performance in the S&P 500 index with a nearly 12% jump, extending their winning streak following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI. A slew of analysts have raised their price targets for AMD this week, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to "buy" from "hold." Dell Technologies (DELL) shares surged 9.1%, after the server maker raised its outlook, citing strong demand driven by the buildout of AI infrastructure. CEO Michael Dell said the company's broad portfolio of tech products makes it well positioned to provide the compute, storage, and network capacity necessary to deploy AI at scale. Optimism around AI helped boost other companies with exposure to the burgeoning technology as well. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) rose about 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to keep growing. Equifax (EFX) announced it will provide its VantageScore 4.0 credit scores at a reduced price or free to customers, just days after Fair Isaac (FICO) said last week that it would offer its FICO credit scores directly to firms that provide credit reports to lenders, reducing reliance on Equifax and the other nationwide credit bureaus. Fair Isaac shares dropped nearly 10%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and reversing a portion of the gains posted after last week's announcement, while Equifax shares advanced close to 1%. Live Nation (LYV) shares fell 3.4% after the Ticketmaster parent announced a plan to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes maturing in 2031. The live entertainment company intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to redeem senior notes due in 2026, repay other debt, and for general corporate purposes.

Title: Think tank founder faces scrutiny over China corporate ties despite decoupling advocacy

Republican strategist Katie Zacharia joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's negotiations with China on trade, tariffs and the framework for a TikTok sale. Oren Cass, founder of the Washington-based think tank American Compass, has built a reputation as one of the right’s most outspoken advocates for economic nationalism and "strategic decoupling" from Beijing. Yet recent details about the group’s corporate partnerships and staff affiliations raise questions about consistency between its rhetoric and its operations. In essays and media appearances, Cass has argued that the United States must take a tougher stance toward China and prioritize domestic manufacturing and independence from Chinese supply chains. In a 2023 Foreign Affairs essay, Cass and a colleague warned that the U.S. "must break from China or else become irrevocably corrupted by it," arguing that economic interdependence had already "weakened America’s industrial base and constrained its political will." MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT Oren Cass has become (Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images) In the same essay, Cass and his co-author argued that China’s influence extended deep into U.S. research and policy institutions. "China has long targeted U.S. universities, think tanks and research institutes to extract economic gain and advance its own ideological agenda," they wrote, adding that such organizations "must accept processes and controls designed to ensure the integrity and security of their work." They went further, calling for legal restrictions. "U.S. law should be changed to prohibit these institutions from entering into any partnerships with China-based and affiliated entities. Any funding flowing from one nation's institutions to the other's must be stopped." Lawmakers from both parties have long raised concerns that the Chinese government exploits educational exchanges, research partnerships and business investments in the U.S. as cover for espionage activities. These warnings have intensified in recent years amid growing scrutiny of Beijing’s influence operations on U.S. soil.

(Photo by Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images) On July 28, 2025, Cass joined a group of policymakers and national security experts in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing "deep concern" over the decision to resume exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. The group warned that the Trump administration’s move "represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence." He reiterated his stance during a conversation on Steve Bannon’s "War Room" podcast where he argued against lifting export restrictions on advanced computer chips bound for China. CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM And yet, Cass’s uncompromising rhetoric on China appears at odds with the realities of operating a Washington think tank in a globalized economy. In June 2025, American Compass hosted a lavish fifth-anniversary gala at Washington’s National Building Museum, an event underwritten in part by Qualcomm, BlackRock, and Google — companies whose global operations remain deeply intertwined with China’s economy.

Fox News Digital reached out to Qualcomm, BlackRock and Google for comment; none responded before publication.

The organization’s director of events and operations previously worked for Alibaba Group, one of China’s largest tech companies. Additionally, an economist on the group’s advisory board is also a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, a leading business institution with close ties to China's Communist Party. Cass and American Compass did not return multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital. While none of these associations are illegal or unusual in Washington, they complicate Cass’ image as a champion of economic separation from China and highlight the difficulty of pursuing that ideal while relying on corporate sponsors.

Title: Spiritans to sell Tipperary farm to fund compensation for abuse survivors

The Spiritan order is to sell one of the biggest farms in Co Tipperary as part of its pledge to compensate victims of abuse. The 765-acre Rockwell Farm will be sold on the open market and is likely to fetch at least €20 million, according to industry sources. The land was used for an agricultural college until the 1980s and is now a dairy farm with up to 650 cows. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. The schools involved were Blackrock College, its feeder junior school Willow Park, Rockwell College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College. In a statement, Spiritans provincial Fr Brendan Carr said the order had been upfront about not having the cash to compensate victims and would instead need to sell assets. He said the order had been “fully transparent about their financial position” from the beginning. “Progress is being made and Rockwell Farm will be the first of these properties to be sold, but this involves multiple legal, valuation and regulatory steps that simply take time to complete.” He added that as a registered charitable organisation, the Spiritans are subject to the oversight of the Charities Regulator and subject to audit. The order also felt a need “to respond clearly to the suggestion that the Spiritans are deliberately delaying or obstructing progress”. Last Friday, the order was accused of adding to the suffering of the survivors by missing the deadline given last June in announcing a redress scheme. The Spiritans had not provided any such update at the end of summer, the Restore Together group said, and had been seeking a meeting with the order ever since. Responding on Wednesday, Fr Carr said “a commitment was made” but “progress has not been as fast as anyone would wish”. [ Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’Opens in new window ] Fr Carr acknowledged “the immense urgency that victims and survivors feel. We feel it too.” He added: “We continue to meet regularly with survivors and to provide ongoing counselling and restorative meetings facilitated by the independent restorative justice team. These encounters are deeply important to us and they continue to shape how we respond and plan.” He appealed “for understanding as we continue to navigate these complex financial and legal steps”. Fr Carr said: “We will provide a further public update as soon as key transactions are concluded and timelines can be confirmed with confidence.” The value of Co Tipperary land was brought into focus during a recent legal action involving billionaire businessman John Magnier. Mr Magnier lost a case at the Commercial Court claiming a verbal agreement to buy the 751-acre Barne Estate amounted to a sale. He agreed a price of €15 million with the owner Richard Thomson-Moore in August 2023, but eventually lost out to New York-based businessman Maurice Regan who agreed to buy the estate for €22.5 million.

Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the tangle of AI deals among tech giants could be signs of dangerous overinvestment in the developing technology. They outline three ways the bubble could pop. Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Seoul on October 1 after agreeing to collaborate on OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project, This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, while Nvidia is investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also counts Microsoft as one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoft accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su has defended AMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expects there to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.” Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos called the current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned that “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reports estimate that AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalest notes that “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanova points out that after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreaking report from Apple suggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” A recent study from MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations considered had achieved zero return on investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently after telling Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy at McKinsey & Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbook reported that nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23% in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such as Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator, on AI startups and the mindboggling valuations of those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI is committed to investing $300 billion in computing power with Oracle over the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation has almost doubled from $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recent reporting by CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Another report says the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk have each raised concerns about the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model, provided a recent example of what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is not difficult to imagine a major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerful Washington Post op-ed, Bethany McLean poignantly recalls the overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” Yale Insights is produced by the Yale School of Management. © 2007-2025 Yale School of Management

Title: How Has The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Fared Compared To Its Older Funds?

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has highlighted how the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has performed in comparison to the world’s largest asset manager’s older funds. This comes as the fund approaches the $100 billion milestone, which will make it the fastest to reach this milestone. In an X post, Balchunas revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is approaching $100 billion, is now the most profitable fund for the asset manager by a “good amount.” The Bloomberg analyst also highlighted that this is a massive feat for the Bitcoin fund, considering its age in comparison to the other funds. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which was launched last year, is currently generating an annual revenue of $244.5 million for the world’s largest asset manager. This is well ahead of BlackRock’s Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which is 25 years old and generates an annual revenue of $219.3 million, placing it in second place. Notably, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is the only fund on the list that has a single-digit age. The other of BlackRock’s funds are 12 years and above. Eric Balchunas also noted that IBIT was approaching $100 billion in assets under management (AuM), which could make it the fastest to reach this milestone. The Bloomberg analyst revealed that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds this record, although it achieved this feat in 2,011 days. Meanwhile, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is just 437 days old, currently has $99.44 billion in assets under management, putting it on track to surpass this record by a considerable margin. This comes as the BlackRock BTC ETF continues to lead the pack, with massive daily net inflows. On October 6, these Bitcoin funds saw $1.19 billion in daily net inflows, with IBIT accounting $970 million of these flows. Meanwhile, they recorded a daily net inflow of $875.6 million yesterday, with IBIT accounting for $899.4 million of these flows. Eric Balchunas also revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now in the top 20 in ETF assets following the rapid increase in its AuM. Based on its current AuM, IBIT is 19th on the list of largest ETFs, just ahead of Vanguard’s VIG and the “legendary” Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Bloomberg analyst remarked that if the last 12 months are repeated, it may not take too long for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF to break into the top 10. He noted that the fund took in $40 billion over the last 12 months and saw an 85% increase. He added that he will put the timeline at December 2026 if he has to give one. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $121,500, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Nvidia's Jensen Huang Says AI Demand Is Up 'Substantially' This Year, and Still Growing
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-says-ai-demand-is-up-substantially-this-year-and-still-growing-11826549
Time Published: 2025-10-08T18:38:45Z
Full Content:
Demand for artificial intelligence is booming and only just getting started, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially,” the CEO told CNBC in a televised interview Wednesday, adding that that he believes the AI boom is still in its early stages, leaving room for further growth. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were up 2% in recent trading, contributing to a rally in the tech sector. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom has seen its stock climb roughly 40% so far in 2025 as sales of its chips to power data centers surged and trade policy headwinds eased. Its move this year has helped propel Nvidia into the top spot as the world's most valuable public company, and made its CEO one of the richest people in the world. As a leading beneficiary of the AI boom, Nvidia has become something of a bellwether for the AI trade, with changes in its business and big moves in its stock able to influence broader markets. Shares of Nvidia partners such as Micron Technology (MU) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) also climbed Wednesday, adding to gains earlier in the week on a massive OpenAI deal with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also collaborates with the companies. AMD's deal came just weeks after Nvidia announced its own deal with OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a social media post Monday that the startup views its AMD deal as incremental to the ChatGPT maker's work with Nvidia, and that "the world needs much more compute." The move raised speculation more high-profile partnerships could be in the works, affecting a growing number of companies, with several Wall Street analysts likening the signal of strong demand for AI to a rising tide that lifts all boats. Huang said Wednesday that his only regret is not investing more in major AI players like OpenAI and CoreWeave (CRWV), an AI data center provider in which Nvidia holds a stake. The CEO also gave a shoutout to Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, saying Nvidia is investing in Musk's xAI and that “almost everything that Elon is part of, you really want to be part of as well." Shares of the EV maker, which were up about 1% Wednesday, have been on a tear in recent weeks, adding roughly a third of their value since the start of September as bulls have shifted more of their focus to the company's developments in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI.

AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) shares soared to a record high as the provider of space-based cellphone service and Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed on a partnership to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. Credit score data provider Fair Isaac (FICO) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after score reporter Equifax (EFX) slashed prices in response to Fair Isaac providing its information directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage companies. Equifax shares advanced. DaVita (DVA) shares declined as Barclays lowered its price target for the kidney dialysis service provider's stock, pointing to a cyberattack that disrupted operations in August. Gold prices high a fresh high, and oil futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar was higher versus the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.

Under the agreement, Verizon will integrate AST’s satellite network with its terrestrial infrastructure, using Verizon’s 850 MHz spectrum to extend coverage in remote areas where towers can’t reach. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The deal builds on an earlier partnership between the two entities announced last year, in which Verizon made a $100 million commitment to support AST’s service rollout. Verizon is the second major carrier to sign with AST, following a 10-year agreement with Vodafone. For AST, the Verizon deal comes at a critical time as the company races to deploy its BlueBird satellite constellation designed to link directly with unmodified cell phones. As of now, the company has successfully placed its first five BlueBird satellites into low Earth orbit, an initial “Block 1” that are intended to deliver “intermittent” coverage across the U.S. Meanwhile, AST is assembling the next generation of satellites — “Block 2” — with plans to deploy between 45-60 satellites by 2026. The partnership also underscores how rapidly the satellite-to-cell market is evolving. SpaceX, through its Starlink network, has already started rolling out its direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile, and recently bolstered its ambitions further by agreeing to acquire $17 billion worth of wireless spectrum from EchoStar. AST has already demonstrated 4G and 5G connections between its satellites and smartphones, including voice and video calls, testing milestones that the company says have “proven the capabilities” of its network. But it still faces the challenge of scaling that technology to serve millions of users. AST shares jumped by more than 15% on Wednesday after the deal was announced.

Title: Jury told Quilligan subjected to a violent assault

Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:30:14Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of Kieran Quilligan has been told that the 47-year-old had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Mr Quilligan's skeletal remains were found in a one-tonne gravel bag on scrub land near Rostellan in east Cork on 29 January last year, five months after he was first reported missing. Niall Long, 33, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon and 27-year-old Luke Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork city have both pleaded not guilty at the Central Criminal Court to murdering Mr Quilligan on dates unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the district court of Cork city, contary to Common Law. On the opening day of the trial before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork, Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan SC told the jury of two women and ten men in his opening address that while the prosecution is not in a position to say who landed the blows, the allegation is that this was a joint enterprise where two people embarked on an enterprise to commit a murder. He said the jury would see alot of CCTV footage of both of the accused and alot of the evidence is circumstantial as there were no eye witnesses. He told jurors that Mr Quilligan was a user of the Simon Community and lived in an apartment provided by them. "He was someone who took drugs and was dealing drugs at the time. Niall Long (one of the co-accused) is someone who was a drug user and may have been dealing drugs as well," Mr O'Sullivan said. Mr O'Sullivan said on the morning of 1 September, Mr Quilligan and another man John Paul Thornton (known as 'Bubbles') robbed and assaulted Mr Long on York Hill. "It appears this is the instigating factor of what occured later that evening," Mr O'Sullivan said. It will be the State's case that at around 8pm that evening, the co-accused Luke Taylor was seen with Kieran Quilligan on CCTV leaving his apartment on Anderson's Quay and heading up along the quays towards St Finbarr's Cathedral. Two people in a house on St Finbarr's Place later reported hearing a violent altercation at around 9pm. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said CCTV will allegedly show a white Toyota RAV4 car registered to Niall Long's mother driving along Dean Street at the top of St Finbarr's Place. It will be claimed that the CCTV footage will show it reversing so that the boot of the car is facing down the lane at 9.05pm. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV footage across Cork city and county and the same car was tracked going to a location in Little Island and afterwards dropping Mr Taylor off at an address at Jacob's Island. Mr O'Sullivan says Mr Quilligan was never seen alive again. He was reported missing on 4 September and a garda investigtion began. He said the jury would also see CCTV footage taken on 4 September which shows Mr Taylor being picked up from the Rochestown Park Hotel at 10.15pm by a white Toyota RAV4, which travelled to a number of locations in east Cork. On 29 January, a cadaver dog on scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, "reacts to an area below the road, wet and damp, not the sort of place anyone would be walking", Mr O'Sullivan said. There gardaí found a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag inside which were skeletal human remains later identified as Kieran Quilligan's. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said post-mortem examination results revealed that while most of the soft tissue was gone, there was a large number of skeletal injuries. "This man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer," he said. "He met his death in a violent manner". Before his remains were found, a search was carried out on 15 September 2023 of Mr Long's home, and a car, as well as a bucket with cleaning products were seized. Blood was found, which matched to Kieran Quilligan. Concluding his opening address to the jury, Mr O'Sullivan said that "I don't have direct evidence, an eye witness saying I saw Niall Long or Luke Taylor beat him to death. I don't have that. "The case is for the most part circumstantial - a man goes missing on 1 September, found on 29 January, most likely he died on 1 September." The trial continues before Ms Justice Lankford, who indicated on Monday that it could last until the end of the month. © RTÉ 2025.

Global investment giants BlackRock and Brevan Howard have announced the launch of their tokenized funds on the Sei network, leveraging Kaios’s advanced infrastructure. Announced on October 8, 2025, the move highlights an accelerating institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The debut introduces BlackRock’s BUIDL and Brevan Howard’s BH Digital Liquidity Fund to the Sei ecosystem, facilitated by Kaios’s institutional-grade platform. Conventional funds under this initiative are transformed into on-chain digital assets, enabling 24/7 compliance with DeFi protocols. BlackRock. Brevan Howard. Live on Sei. The most powerful names in global finance are coming to Sei via @KAIO_xyz — beginning with BlackRock's ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard's Master Fund, now live. RWAs Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/fXaTgQvx1c — Sei (@SeiNetwork) October 8, 2025 Sei’s architecture ensures robust handling of high-volume transactions while maintaining enterprise-level security. Mr. Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, commenting on the announcement “This launch marks another major milestone in institutional blockchain adoption. By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain. It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets.” Justin Barlow, Executive Director at the Sei Development Foundation, in his statement, also stated, “The integration of KAIO’s onchain infrastructure with the Sei Network is another important step toward the goal for Sei to become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets. Sei’s high-performance rails enable a seamless experience for trading money market funds onchain–one that is superior to the experience of trading those funds in the real world.” This collaboration addresses longstanding pain points in asset management, such as settlement delays and high costs. By embedding KYC/AML protocols and secure custody solutions, Kaios ensures regulatory alignment, paving the way for broader institutional inflows into tokenized RWAs. The debut of these high-profile funds is poised to catalyze demand for the SEI token. As institutional activity surges, network usage is expected to rise, enhancing SEI’s deflationary mechanics and staking yields. SEI is trading at near $0.28, with a 4% weekly loss amid broader crypto market profit taking. Short-term forecasts anticipate modest recovery, targeting $0.40-$0.50, bolstered by Sei’s growing network, partnerships. Medium-term outlooks predict SEI reaching $1, with the all-time high of $1.14 allowing for further upside. The price trajectory hinges on sustained partnerships and regulatory tailwinds like potential SEC approvals for staking yields. An $18 million token unlock is a challenge that could introduce supply pressure. Sei’s staking ratio and recent 50% weekly surges suggest resilience. This launch cements Sei’s role in institutional blockchain innovation, with SEI’s price outlook tilting positive amid heightened utility and capital inflows.

Title: The Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: BITCOIN HOLDERS HESITANT TO EXPLORE BTC DEFI : Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. — Jamie Crawley Read more. ETHEREUM FUSAKA UPGRADE ON HOLESKY TESTNET GOES LIVE: Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network last week. The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for October 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. DOUBLEZERO MAINNET GOES LIVE: A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live. DoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster. In simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users. The project has already seen early adoption. When it went live, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network (as of publication is at 25%.) Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BEE MAPS RAISES $32M IN FUNDING ROUND: Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced this week. The round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year. Bee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana. Hivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery. The raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms. The fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY. – Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Title: BlackRock dominates all ETFs with $3.5bn haul: ‘that’s how hungry the fish are’

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are relentless. Larry Fink’s firm led exchange-traded fund flows across every sector last week, topping the list with $3.5 billion in flows into its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. That’s 10% of all net inflows into ETFs. In second and third place came Vanguard and State Street. Their flagship S&P 500 trackers, SPLG and VOO, hauled in $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. What’s impressive, however, is that both are getting lapped by a two-year-old. BlackRock’s IBIT has been around since January 2024, while Vanguard’s SPLG is 20 years old, and State Street’s VOO has been around for 15 years. Still, BlackRock wasn’t alone in its feeding frenzy. Every single Bitcoin ETF took in cash last week, with a total of 43,100 Bitcoin worth about $4.8 billion, according to Coinglass. “That’s how hungry the fish are,” said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst. “Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” Moreover, flows into Bitcoin ETFs are nearly on par with 2024, with just under three months still to go. Year-to-date, inflows are now at $48.3 billion versus last year’s $48.5 billion, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Since its inception, BlackRock Bitcoin investors have been insatiable. The fund is now nearing $100 billion in assets under management, making it the most profitable of all BlackRock ETFs. Loads of that capital comes from investors who had to wait a decade before the SEC greenlit a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product. Now that it’s here, almost two years in, investors can’t get enough of it. And lately, conditions have been favouring even more exposure to crypto’s top asset. The “sustained high appetite” is driven by several factors, Butterfill told DL News. For one, the Fed is starting to cut interest rates — which tends to favour risky assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum — while the US government shutdown is forcing investors to find protection. “The ongoing U.S. government shutdown impasse shows no clear path to resolution,” said Butterfill. “This increasingly projects an image of ineffectiveness and raises questions about US creditworthiness.” Off the back of BlackRock’s voracious appetite and the confluence of macro factors came a new all-time high for Bitcoin. The crypto topped $126,000 on Monday for the first time. BlackRock’s $3.5 billion intake is nothing short of impressive. Notably, that figure represents more capital than the entire crypto venture capital funding for the first quarter of 2024 by a wide margin. Back then, VCs ploughed just over $2.2 billion into crypto startups, according to DefiLlama. With some of the recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption, there are plenty more bullish signs flashing. Take crypto treasuries. They’re the firms that buy and hold tokens to bolster their balance sheets, hoping to ride the coattails of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s historic price appreciation. Currently, the top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold approximately 1 million Bitcoin, valued at around $127 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. And that’s just Bitcoin. Ethereum treasuries have been even more aggressive than their Bitcoin counterparts, accumulating more than $25 billion in barely six months.

Title: Bank of England Warns of an AI Bubble Burst
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bank-of-england-warns-of-an-ai-bubble-burst-2000669588

reading time 3 minutes The central bank of the United Kingdom is worried about an AI bubble burst. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” the bank’s financial policy committee said, according to a record of its latest meeting. “This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.” The Bank also warned that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five companies are, unsurprisingly, AI-focused tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. All five of these companies are spending eye-watering figures on AI, and the stock market loves it. Microsoft became the second company to ever hit a $4 trillion market valuation earlier this year after posting its largest ever quarterly expenditure forecast. Nvidia, on the other hand, is the first and only company in the world to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. “Material bottlenecks to AI progress â from power, data, or commodity supply chains â as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment,” the bank said. Fed researchers issued a similar warning earlier this year. While that alert did not identify an immediate risk of an AI bubble, the researchers pointed out that a risk that comes with building expensive infrastructure too quickly for anticipated demand was that demand might not grow as expected. In that case, it could lead to “disastrous consequences,” the Fed warned, likening it to the railroad over-expansion of the 1800s that led to an economic depression towards the turn of the century. These top AI companies with high revenue expectations are also heavily reliant on each other financially, increasing worries of a cascade effect if a bubble bursts. AI companies ink multibillion-dollar deals with each other over and over again, injecting more money into the system and ballooning stock valuations with each deal. While that’s happening, some experts are admitting overvaluation. Apollo Global Management’s chief economist Torsten Slok said in July that the AI bubble of today is actually worse than the 1999 dot-com bubble. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also admitted in August that he thinks investors are “over-excited about AI.” The main downside risks of AI overvaluation, according to the bank, also include disappointing AI capability or adoption progress. A recent MIT report found that despite the major push to adopt AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs actually generated real revenue gains. The report spooked investors enough that AI stocks immediately slid following the headlines in August. Last month, the Census Bureau showed that the rate of AI adoption by large companies had been declining slightly. Nonetheless, executives keep assuring investors that AI demand is scaling rapidly as the technology finds its way into more and more areas of life. AI computing demand is up “substantially” in the past six months, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on Wednesday. But if the tech giants are wrong and the Bank of England’s risk scenario does end up being the case, the bank warned that a sudden, sharp correction could occur, “adversely affecting the cost and availability of finance for households and businesses.” The U.S. has reason to be afraid of this. According to recent reports, the AI spending frenzy is not just propping up the American stock market, but it’s also lifting the real economy. According to Harvard economist James Furman‘s calculations, U.S. GDP growth in the first half of the year was almost entirely driven by investments made in data centers and other information-processing technology.

AI art really has become the aesthetic of grifters and fascists. The company dropped plans for a 244-acre project as resource-intensive data centers spread across the country. Meta expects expects 80% of Metaverse employees to have AI integrated into their daily routines by the end of the year. So long as Lee is president of DC Studios, the company will not have its heroes drawn or written by AI. Nvidia previously claimed you needed its GPUs to achieve multi-frame generation.

October 08, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT), a Southern California–based real estate development and investment firm, today announced progress on its tokenization strategy led by its flagship platform, Gaia, and confirmed that Gaia is set to begin beta testing on November 1, 2025. Interested participants can join the waitlist now for early access and to be the first notified at primior.com/gaia. Tokenization—the representation of real-world assets on a digital ledger—is emerging as one of the most transformative trends in global finance. While institutions such as BlackRock are advancing tokenization of public assets like stocks and bonds, Gaia is positioning itself to lead in tokenizing private markets—including private equity, private credit, and real estate. By lowering barriers to entry and enabling more flexible investment structures, Gaia is designed to change how capital is raised across private markets. Mission-Aligned GrowthGaia’s mission is democratizing real estate investing for all. With global real estate estimated to exceed $600 trillion, even a 1% market share represents a $6 trillion opportunity. Gaia aims to lead the tokenization of real estate by improving access, liquidity, and efficiency for investors and sponsors alike. Development Platform: GP-Led Execution Backed by USP & Institutions Alongside Gaia’s progress, Primior’s development platform continues to advance substantial projects where Primior acts as the General Partner (GP) and is fully responsible for end-to-end execution—from site acquisition and entitlements through design, capital stack structuring, construction, lease-up, and asset management. The company is currently developing more than $100M in projects, which are capitalized by USP and other institutional investors. USP (United States Property) is Primior Group’s flagship tokenized real estate fund. USP is a security token representing ownership in the fund; holding USP provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of U.S. real estate. The development pipeline managed by Primior as GP supplies high-quality opportunities that can be aggregated and managed within tokenized structures like USP, aligning tangible assets with modern digital ownership rails. (No offer of securities is being made by this release; see “No Offer or Solicitation” below.) Primior Holdings Inc. is part of the broader Primior Group, which includes private affiliates in asset management, property management, and investment banking. These divisions provide depth and expertise across real estate, fund management, and financial advisory, further strengthening the credibility and execution capacity behind Primior Holdings’ public-market initiatives. “Our strategy with Gaia is clear,” said Johnney Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Primior Holdings. “We believe tokenization will fundamentally change how private equity and real estate are financed. Gaia is built to lead that change, creating investment opportunities that are more inclusive, transparent, and scalable than traditional models.” Corporate Update: Reverse Split & Capital Structure After careful consideration and in response to shareholder feedback, Primior Holdings will cancel the previously announced reverse split. In addition, the company plans to retire the outstanding note and convert it into preferred equity rather than common equity. Primior will provide a further update once additional information is available. About Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) is a real estate development and investment firm headquartered in Irvine, California. The company is advancing next-generation financial solutions through Gaia, its proprietary tokenization platform for private equity and real estate.

Title: Top Altcoins to Watch as XRP Liquidations Shake the Market

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A sudden 4,455% spike in $XRP’s hourly liquidation imbalance just wiped out $8.14M in bullish bets, and the market’s feeling it Coming right after $XRP briefly surpassed BlackRock in market cap, the drop shows just how fragile sentiment remains in Uptober’s volatile environment run. As risk-off sentiment spreads, some traders are already seeking the next breakout opportunities in top altcoins to buy, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Maxi Doge ($MAXI), and Aster ($ASTER). $XRP’s recent move was a complete wipeout. According to Coinglass data, long positions fueled the liquidation imbalance, with bulls losing nearly $25M in 24 hours, including a single hour that wiped out $8.14M. The price drop knocked $XRP out of the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, with $BNB reclaiming the spot after its own surge to new all-time highs. Investors who once bet on $XRP’s momentum toward its ATH of $3.66 are now watching confidence fade fast. This sudden correction highlights how quickly leverage can backfire on traders in a thin market. While $XRP bulls recover from losses, rotation is already underway. The focus is shifting toward trending cryptocurrencies showing real momentum and early upside potential. As $BTC stays strong above $122K, traders are shifting into ecosystems that expand Bitcoin’s utility, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is at the forefront. Bitcoin Hyper is a complete Layer 2 scaling solution powered by Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM). In simple terms, it provides Bitcoin with what it’s always lacked – speed and low fees. That results in instant $BTC payments, DeFi applications, and even meme coins, all secured by Bitcoin’s main layer. Discover how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. Here’s how it works: you bridge your $BTC in, the system verifies it on-chain, then mints the same amount on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. Transactions run sub-second and near-zero cost before settling back to Bitcoin via zero-knowledge proofs. In a week where $XRP’s ‘utility’ narrative took a beating, $HYPER shows what real scalability looks like. Grab $HYPER before the next presale price jump. When blue-chip coins wobble, the best meme coins usually get their second wind, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is ready to flex. The ultra-ripped cousin of Dogecoin, Maxi Doge channels the degen bull run mindset with muscle, memes, and market discipline. $MAXI celebrates pure grind culture by never skipping leg day or a 1000x play. The branding is absurd, but it resonates strongly with traders who prioritize conviction and community over charts. With Dogecoin ($DOGE) up 136% in the past year, meme season’s clearly not over. Future tie-ins with leverage and trading platforms hint at deeper utility ahead, giving $MAXI more potential than most meme coins at launch. As traders de-risk from volatile majors like $XRP, meme-driven liquidity is already shifting toward community-first plays. Maxi Doge isn’t just a meme; it’s a lifestyle token designed for traders who thrive in a fast-paced environment. Join the $MAXI movement and embrace the grind – the charts don’t lift themselves. Following the chaos of $XRP’s liquidation, traders are rethinking where they park their leverage, and many are pivoting to on-chain solutions. Aster ($ASTER) is emerging as that safe haven: a next-gen decentralized exchange offering MEV-free perpetuals and spot trading across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum. Aster also allows users to post yield-bearing assets, such as $asBNB or $USDF, as collateral, thereby boosting capital efficiency for professional traders. The numbers speak for themselves – a $3.47B market cap, $1.49B 24-hour volume, and a 43% volume-to-market capitalization ratio, signaling extremely high attention. Aster’s roadmap also hints at cross-market integration, connecting crypto and traditional assets through stock perpetuals and hidden orders. This hybrid approach will position $ASTER as a full trading stack built for speed, privacy, and institutional-grade liquidity. Built on Aster Chain and backed by YZi Labs, the DEX delivers transparent governance – exactly what shaken traders are craving post-$XRP crash. Unlike $XRP’s centralized token dynamics, Aster thrives on openness, efficiency, and community-driven design. Buy $ASTER on Binance today. This article does not constitute financial advice.

Title: 2,700 Crypto Rigs Seized: Russia Launches Biggest Mining Raid Of The Year
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/2700-crypto-rigs-seized-russia-launches-biggest-mining-raid-of-the-year/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:30:41Z
Full Content:
According to reports, Russian police have seized around 2,700 crypto mining equipment from a site in St. Petersburg after a months-long probe into unusually low meter readings. The haul included banks of machines, fans and other cooling gear, and the authorities say they also took away two transformers. Investigators say the operation started after energy inspectors noticed inconsistencies between recorded meter figures and actual power use. The site had been connected to the grid since March 2018. It ran, according to officials, until August 2025. Police say three unnamed St. Petersburg residents had originally signed a contract to connect a commercial property to the grid more than seven years ago. Officers released video of the raid on a ministry Telegram channel. The footage shows police forcing open locked containers and pushing a man to the floor as they searched the premises. In one container, rows of active machines could be seen, with fans running and cooling systems in place. Other rooms held hundreds more rigs. Based on reports from the Interior Ministry, investigators believe the suspects used technical knowledge of the power grid to alter meter readings so the utility would show much lower consumption than was actually used. The suspects behind the illegal crypto mining rig operation were placed in custody and charged with causing “property damage by deception or abuse of trust,” prosecutors said. The ministry has not released an estimate of how much electricity was taken or the financial value of the theft. Officials also did not say which digital coins were being mined at the site. Police added they are still looking for possible accomplices linked to the operation. This seizure follows similar discoveries across Russia and territories under Moscow’s control. In mid-September, authorities uncovered an illegal cluster in what Moscow calls the Donetsk People’s Republic where operators had connected 25 rigs directly to the grid, bypassing meters. Officials reported damage estimated at 14 million rubles ($170,633) for that network. In other areas, hidden setups have appeared underground or inside trucks and vans. Regions mentioned by officials include Dagestan, parts of the North Caucasus and Southern Siberia — places where cheap or poorly monitored power has sometimes attracted clandestine miners.

Title: AI could wipe out 100 million US jobs – Bernie Sanders report
URL: https://www.rt.com/business/626089-ai-technology-us-jobs/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:20:07Z
Full Content:
Artificial intelligence and automation technologies pose a threat to nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released on Monday by Senator Bernie Sanders. The report suggests the disruption will be widespread, affecting both white- and blue-collar professions. According to Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, AI and automation could replace 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants, and 89% of fast food workers. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” The warning contrasts with the stance of the Trump administration, which has championed American leadership in AI development, arguing that losing the technological race to China poses a national security threat. In an opinion piece for Fox News accompanying the report, Sanders questioned the motives behind these massive investments, noting that “some of the very wealthiest people in the world,” including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, are pouring hundreds of billions into the technology. He warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” Sanders argued that the technology is being leveraged primarily to increase corporate profits and concentrate wealth, citing executives who have announced significant investments in automation concurrently with mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The senator warned that workers in manufacturing, trucking, and taxi services face a particularly severe impact from the rapid advancement of self-driving projects by automakers and tech companies. He also expressed skepticism that their goal was to uplift the “60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck” and believes the true driver is because “investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially.” The trend is already underway, with corporate giants Amazon and Walmart having eliminated tens of thousands of positions as they intensify automation.

Title: Man was murdered in Cork after carrying out robbery and assault, trial hears
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/10/08/man-was-murdered-in-cork-after-carrying-out-robbery-and-assault-trial-hears/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:19:08Z
Full Content:
The murder of a man whose body was found months after he went missing had its origins in an assault and robbery he and another person committed, a jury has heard. Donal O’Sullivan SC, prosecuting, told jurors they will hear evidence how Mr Quilligan and another man had assaulted and robbed Niall Long off York Street in Cork city on September 1st, 2023. “This apparently was the instigating factor to what happened later,” Mr O’Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork. Mr Long (33), of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, deny the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th last year. Mr O’Sullivan said the jury would hear Mr Quilligan (47) was a drug user and dealer and that Mr Long was a drug user and may also have been dealing drugs. After being assaulted on September 1st, Mr Long could be seen on CCTV around Cork city, while Mr Taylor could be seen on CCTV with Mr Quilligan some time before 9pm leaving Mr Quilligan’s flat in the Simon Community complex on Anderson’s Quay. Mr O’Sullivan said Mr Quilligan and Mr Taylor went up St Finbarr’s Place lane. Two people in a nearby house heard a “violent altercation” and called the guards, he said. He said a white Toyota Rav registered to Mr Long’s mother was reversed into the top of St Finbarr’s Place with the boot facing the lane. Neither Mr Quilligan nor Mr Taylor were seen on CCTV at the top of the lane before the car left the area. “Kieran Quilligan is never seen alive again,” Mr O’Sullivan said, saying gardaí tracked the vehicle to a farm at Little Island and then back to the city, where Mr Taylor is dropped off. Mr O’Sullivan said gardaí later became concerned about an area at Whitewell, Rostellan. With a cadaver dog, gardaí searched the area on January 29th last year and found skeletal remains in a gravel bag. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established Mr Quilligan suffered bone injuries, but she could not determine a cause of death. Mr O’Sullivan said: “The man was beaten badly. A weapon in the nature of a hammer was used. He met in his end in a violent manner after a lot of bony injuries.” He told the jury of 10 men and two women how gardaí had months earlier searched Mr Long’s home and a vehicle and they had discovered a bucket with cleaning products found to contain blood matching Mr Quilligan’s. “I don’t have direct evidence. I don’t have witnesses saying, ‘I saw Luke Taylor and Niall Long beat him to death’. I don’t have that. The case is for the most part circumstantial: a man goes missing on September 1st, found on January 29th. Most likely he died on September 1st,” he said. The trial continues.

Shares of AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) blasted off, trading at an all-time high after the provider of space-based cellphone service announced it had struck a deal with Verizon Communications (VZ) to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. AST said the service will be available to Verizon customers next year and will allow them to have cell reception wherever they are without the need for specialized equipment. Verizon customers will be able to get cellphone service virtually anywhere in the continental U.S. without specialized equipment. The partnership with AST SpaceMobile promises more reliable coverage in remote areas, opening the door to a new era of space-based connectivity starting in 2026. AST noted that the agreement came after the company’s AST SpaceMobile network hit certain milestones in tests. Financial terms were not listed. The deal “will extend the scope of Verizon’s 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology," said Founder and CEO Abel Avellan. Srini Kalapala, senior vice president of technology and product development at Verizon, said the partnership is “not just filling in the map; we are creating a new paradigm of connectivity that will unlock the full potential of the digital age.” AST SpaceMobile shares have soared 250% this year. Shares of Verizon are little changed today.

Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google As SpaceX races to dominate satellite-to-phone services, Verizon is doubling down on rival AST SpaceMobile instead. On Wednesday, Verizon announced it had signed a commercial agreement with the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile to supply satellite-to-phone connectivity starting next year. Terms were kept under wraps. But the agreement promises to give Verizon customers a new way to remain connected in cellular dead zones by tapping AST’s orbiting satellites, which have been designed to power voice and video calls, along with data. Currently, Verizon subscribers on certain phones can receive only limited satellite-powered texting through partner Skylo. Importantly, the deal solidifies Verizon’s relationship with AST after the two initially announced a “strategic partnership” last year. The partnership calls for Verizon to commit $100 million while giving AST access to a slice of its radio spectrum to power the satellite-to-phone services. However, industry watchers have been waiting for an actual commercial agreement between the two. There was even speculation that Verizon could back out and tap SpaceX, which offers its cellular Starlink service through T-Mobile. Last month, Elon Musk's company also reached a $17 billion deal to acquire valuable radio spectrum for Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar, to upgrade the cellular Starlink system with even more capacity. Wednesday’s agreement signals that Verizon is going all in on AST, even though it’s still months away from offering commercial service to users. In contrast, SpaceX already has over 650 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit and has been delivering service to T-Mobile users since January, first as a beta and then with a formal launch in July. AT&T is also betting on AST; last year, the carrier announced its own commercial agreement that lasts until 2030. But the major challenge facing AST is launching enough satellites in time. It's using Blue Origin, India’s national space agency, and SpaceX as launch partners. The company currently has only five of its “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, when it needs 45 to 60 to deliver continuous coverage in the US. AST was supposed to fly up a prototype FM1 satellite in August, the first second-generation BlueBird. However, the launch has been delayed until December or January. Still, AST indicated last week it could send up a separate second-generation BlueBird in the coming weeks. In a tweet, the company noted: “BlueBird 7 is expected to ship to the Cape Canaveral launch site in October.” The same tweet also reiterated that AST expects to have 45 to 60 satellites in orbit by the end of next year. In Wednesday’s announcement, AST also emphasized its tests show the company’s satellites can complete “direct voice and video calls, as well as two-way RCS messaging, between standard, unmodified smartphones.” “A crystal-clear Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call was made from a smartphone on Verizon's network in Texas, connecting via an AST SpaceMobile satellite to another Verizon smartphone in New Jersey,” the company added. “These successful tests represent a significant leap in satellite-to-cellular technology and pave the way for a future of ubiquitous connectivity.” My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Title: Investors can’t hold back their AI bubble jitters anymore as gold pushes beyond $4,000 per ounce

Time Published: 2025-10-08T14:05:41Z
Full Content:
U.S. stocks are edging higher, a day after breaking their seven-day winning streak, while the price of gold is pushing further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% in early trading Wednesday and is near its all-time high set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51 points, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%. AST SpaceMobile soared after Verizon Communications agreed to use its space-based network to offer service to its cellular customers when needed, starting next year. The stock market is near records, but trading has been muted recently following the U.S. government’s latest shutdown. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Wall Street ticked slightly higher in early trading Wednesday after posting the first loss in eight days. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each rose 0.1% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%. The price of gold, which topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, continued to rise, trading up nearly $53, or 1.3%, at $4,057.50. Investors have traditionally seen gold as a hedge against high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year because of governments’ huge debt loads, political uncertainties and anticipation that the Fed will continue to trim its benchmark lending rate after cutting for the first time this year in September. The minutes of that September meeting will be released today at 2 p.m. ET, which investors and analysts will scour for clues about how many more rate cuts could be coming this year. Most economists are expecting at least one more cut as the Fed tries to manage a weakening labor market and inflation that remains above its target of 2%. Equifax gained 2.5% before the bell after the credit reporting agency slashed the price of its mortgage credit score product by more than 50% below competitor Fair Isaac’s. Fair Isaac shares soared last week after it announced a program to streamline access to its FICO credit scores. Fair Isaac shares slid 3.7% before the bell Wednesday. Artificial intelligence stocks are mixed as Bank of England warned Wednesday of the rising risk that tech stock share prices pumped up by the AI boom could face a “sudden correction.” “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” policymakers at the U.K. central bank said in a report. With Big Tech companies accounting for an increasingly outsize share of stock market indexes, stocks are “particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.” AI stocks have been on a tear this year. Chipmaker Nvidia is up nearly 40% since January, Oracle is up 70% and Palantir is up 140%. Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are all up sharply. In Europe at midday the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.8% as departing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, aiming to calm the political storm triggered by his resignation on Monday less than 24 hours after unveiling his ministers, raced to beat a deadline Wednesday to break a deadlock caused by his decision to quit. Germany’s DAX rose 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 jumped 0.9%. The U.S. dollar has risen against the euro, thanks to the upheavals in France, and also against the Japanese yen. The yen has fallen sharply on expectations that Sanae Takaichi, the conservative lawmaker likely to become the next prime minister, will push to keep interest rates low. The dollar rose to 152.70 yen from 151.90 yen early Wednesday, while the euro slipped to $1.1633 from $1.1659. Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.5% to 47,734.99. It had jumped to new records earlier this week after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Takaichi as their leader last weekend. She is expected to increase spending and to advocate for easier credit, possibly slowing efforts by the Bank of Japan to raise its key interest rate. It has remained near zero for years, even as inflation has exceeded its target of about 2%, outpacing wage increases. The government reported Wednesday that inflation-adjusted wages fell in August for the eighth straight month. “While the economic case for tighter monetary policy remains intact, we suspect that the Bank of Japan will use the pressure by Japan’s incoming government as an opportunity to delay rate hikes until January,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary. Lawmakers in Japan’s lower house of parliament are due to elect a successor to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this month. The Liberal Democrats hold the most seats despite not having an outright majority, so Takaishi is expected to become the country’s first female prime minister. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.5% to 26,829.46 and the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,947.60. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays. In Taiwan, the Taiex lost 0.5%. India’s Sensex was up 0.1%. Also early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 81 cents, or 1.3%, at $62.54 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 79 cents to $66.24 per barrel. _____ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The satellite design and manufacturing company is up more than 300% in 2025. Why: On Wednesday, AST SpaceMobile announced an agreement with Verizon to provide cell service to consumers from space. Starting next year, the company will provide Verizon customers with a direct-to-cellular connection via satellite. According to AST SpaceMobile, its network features the largest commercial communications array ever deployed into low Earth orbit. The technology can connect directly to standard smartphones. "The agreement will extend the scope of Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology, stated AST SpaceMobile founder and CEO Abel Avellan. What it means: The Verizon deal is a major milestone for the company, which has emerged as a popular stock among retail traders looking for exposure to the growing space tech sector. The news on Wednesday prompted a jubilant reaction from traders on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Its partnership with an industry leader like Verizon may be a turning point for what's often been viewed as a meme stock, as it could position AST SpaceMobile as a serious competitor to larger rivals like SpaceX. In September, ASTS stock briefly surged on momentum when a Mexican news outlet reported that América Móvil was considering taking a stake, a story that SpaceMobile revealed to be false. Jump to

Title: AppLovin Stock Up 85%. Learn Whether To Bet Against $APP

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. AppLovin stock experienced sharp volatility, dropping then recovering significantly, as an SEC investigation into its data practices emerged amidst analyst buy recommendations.The company is reportedly under SEC investigation for alleged "fingerprinting" data collection, spurred by short-seller claims, which AppLovin denies as false and misleading.Despite strong financial performance and AI-powered growth, AppLovin faces risks from potential regulatory sanctions, high valuation, and insider selling. AppLovin stock is up 85% in 2025. However, the stock fell 14% on Monday and dropped 3% in Tuesday premarket trading before reversing course – ending the day up 7.6%. The recovery may have been due to reports from Citigroup and Oppenheimer which reiterated their buy recommendations and suggested the market overreacted to reports into an investigation of the company by the Securities and Exchange Commission, noted MarketBeat. But short sellers – ApplLovin’s short interest is 6.6% of its float, according to the Wall Street Journal – have issued reports raising questions about how the mobile advertising company delivers its services. Their questions may have prompted an SEC investigation of AppLovin’s data-collection practices, according to Bloomberg. The company’s rapid and highly profitable growth make a compelling case for AppLovin bulls. However, if the SEC investigation results in changes to the company’s business model, the company’s growth could slow – rewarding the short sellers with a drop in the company’s stock. AppLovin denies short sellers’ claims. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote in February blog post. AppLovin did not comment on the report of an SEC investigation. “We regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,” the company said in an email to Bloomberg. “Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels.” Neither did the SEC. “During the shutdown, the SEC’s public affairs office is not able to respond to many inquiries from the press,” the agency said by email to Bloomberg. I think AppLovin’s positives outweigh the negatives. Moreover, selling a stock short – borrowing shares from a broker, selling them, and hoping to repay the loan at a profit by buying back the shares at a lower price – is extremely risky. If AppLovin was poised to go out of business, that might be a risk worth considering. But that does not appear imminent. Indeed, analysts estimate the stock could rise 5% to meet their price target. Traders who see more downside in the company’s stock might buy puts – which provide the option, but not the obligation – to sell the stock at a specific price the trader hopes will be higher than the market price. I have requested comment from AppLovin and will update this post if I receive a reply. The SEC is reportedly looking into the company’s data collection practices. More specifically, the agency has assigned cyber and emerging technologies officials to investigate “allegations that AppLovin violated platform partners’ service agreements to push more targeted advertising to consumers,” according to anonymous sources featured in a Bloomberg report. A whistleblower complaint and several short-seller reports published in the last several months have prompted the SEC investigation. AppLovin has not been charged and such probes may result in fines for companies or corporate officials, reported Bloomberg. AppLovin stock has been rising rapidly – with the company’s market capitalization soaring 700% in 2024 and its market capitalization nearly doubling this year to $230 billion as of last week, according to CNBC. The company helps mobile app developers find users and sell advertising in their apps. In September, AppLovin was added to the S&P 500 – rising on a “wave of interest in artificial intelligence tools and ad placement,” noted Bloomberg. Here are bullish indicators for the stock: A big reason to avoid the stock is the risk of regulatory sanctions if the SEC finds valid the short seller and whistleblower allegations against the company. Short seller reports allege AppLovin has violated data collection rules. For example, Fuzzy Panda and Muddy Waters accused AppLovin of fingerprinting – unauthorized harvesting of proprietary identifiers from other platforms "to track users across different websites and apps and retarget them with advertising,” noted Bloomberg. Apple’s App Store prohibits fingerprinting as did Google until a February policy change, added Bloomberg. AppLovin challenged the short seller reports saying they were “littered with inaccuracies” and denied creating “alternative accurate and persistent identifiers, typically called device fingerprints,” noted Foroughi’s blog post. AppLovin also hired Alex Spiro – whose clients include Elon Musk, according to Business Insider. Spiro is conducting an “independent review and investigation into recent short report activity,” reported Bloomberg, and continues to investigate the source of the reports which he dubbed “clearly false.” Here are other reasons to avoid the stock: Wall Street views AppLovin shares as slightly undervalued. Based on 18 analysts offering 12 month price targets for AppLovin, the stock would need to rise 5% to reach their average price target of $664.41, according to TipRanks.

October 08, 2025 09:01 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced that it is now shipping Tomahawk® 6 – Davisson (TH6-Davisson), the company’s third-generation Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) Ethernet switch. Designed specifically for the accelerating demands of AI networking, TH6-Davisson is the industry’s first to deliver an unprecedented 102.4 terabits per second of optically enabled switching capacity. Doubling the bandwidth of any CPO switch available today, TH6-Davisson sets a new benchmark for data center performance. Built on Broadcom’s foundation of CPO innovation and field shipments, the platform doubles the bandwidth of any CPO switch available today, while delivering major advancements in power efficiency and traffic stability to unlock optical interconnect performance required to scale-up and scale-out the world’s most demanding AI clusters. “TH6-Davisson, our third-generation CPO Ethernet switch, represents a significant advancement for AI infrastructure,” said Near Margalit, Vice President and General Manager, Optical Systems Division, Broadcom. “By enhancing link stability and energy efficiency, we’re enabling smoother, more cost-effective AI model training. We designed this platform to scale large AI clusters by delivering on the three imperatives for optical interconnect: higher model FLOPs utilization, reduced job interruptions, and improved cluster reliability.” CPO: Purpose-Built for AI Networking The rise of large-scale AI training and inference is driving unprecedented east-west traffic in data centers, as XPUs and GPUs exchange vast datasets across tens of thousands of servers. Traditional pluggable optics are straining under this growth—consuming more power, introducing higher latency, and demanding larger system footprints. TH6-Davisson embodies Broadcom’s lead-edge and robust CPO architecture that has been fine-tuned over multiple generations of development to overcome these barriers and deliver the bandwidth, efficiency, and reliability required for next-generation AI networks. World-Class Energy Efficiency TH6-Davisson was architected from the ground up for power efficiency. By heterogeneously integrating TSMC Compact Universal Photonic Engine (TSMC COUPE™) technology-based optical engines with advanced substrate-level multi-chip packaging, the switch dramatically reduces the need for signal conditioning and minimizes trace loss and reflections. The result is a 70% reduction in optical interconnect power consumption—more than 3.5x lower than traditional pluggable solutions—delivering a step change in energy efficiency for hyperscale and AI data centers. Improved Link Stability and Traffic Performance As AI training jobs scale, link stability has become a critical bottleneck, with even minor interruptions causing measurable losses in XPU and GPU utilization. TH6-Davisson addresses this challenge by directly integrating optical engines onto a common package with the Ethernet switch. This highly integrated design eliminates many of the sources of manufacturing and test variability inherent in pluggable transceivers. The result is significantly improved link flap performance and higher cluster reliability as validated by a TH5-Bailly link flap study here. Bandwidth Improvement and Interoperability Operating at 200 Gbps per channel, TH6-Davisson doubles the line rate and overall bandwidth of Broadcom’s second-generation TH5-Bailly CPO solution. Designed for interoperability, it seamlessly interconnects with DR-based transceivers as well as LPO and CPO optical interconnects running at 200 Gbps per channel. This ensures frictionless connectivity with the industry’s most advanced NICs, XPUs, and fabric switches, enabling next-generation AI and cloud clusters to scale without compromise. CPO Roadmap Leveraging the advanced CMOS nodes and continuous breakthroughs in device technology, Broadcom is now developing its fourth-generation CPO solution. The new generation will double per-channel bandwidth to 400 Gbps while achieving greater levels of energy efficiency, further extending Broadcom’s leadership in enabling the scale and sustainability of future AI and cloud networks.

Murphy, United States District Judge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, James A. Byrne U.S. Courthouse, Courtroom 3-B, 601 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106, for the purpose of determining: (1) whether the proposed Settlement of the claims in the above-captioned Action for consideration including the sum of $25,000,000 should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, and adequate; (2) whether the proposed plan to distribute the Settlement proceeds is fair, reasonable, and adequate; (3) whether the application of Lead Counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees of up to one-third of the Settlement Amount plus interest, reimbursement of expenses of not more than $985,000, and service awards of no more than $20,000 to each Plaintiff, or $240,000 in total, should be approved; and (4) whether this Action should be dismissed with prejudice as set forth in the Stipulation of Settlement, dated September 5, 2025 (“Stipulation”). The Court reserves the right to hold the Settlement Hearing telephonically or by other virtual means. You may have previously received notice of a $40 million settlement in this Action (“Prior Settlement”). The Prior Settlement was ultimately not approved by the Court due to the intervening settlement agreements that The Vanguard Group, Inc. (“Vanguard”) entered into with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and certain state regulators concerning substantially the same alleged conduct (“SEC Settlement”). The SEC Settlement required Vanguard to pay $92.91 million in remediation to an SEC Fair Fund (“Fair Fund”), which will be distributed to affected investors. After the Court denied approval of the Prior Settlement, Vanguard paid an additional $40 million into the Fair Fund, pursuant to the SEC Settlement. This $25 million Settlement provides compensation in addition to the $132.91 million that will be paid to investors through the Fair Fund. This Settlement is not intended to preclude or limit Settlement Class Members’ ability to participate in the Fair Fund. The SEC has not yet determined exactly who will be eligible to recover in the Fair Fund or how or when it will be distributed. All questions about the SEC Settlement or Fair Fund should be directed to the SEC. If you received capital gains distributions in 2021 from Investor TRFs that were held in a Taxable Account or in a Tax-Advantaged Account where capital gains from the Investor TRFs in 2021 were distributed outside of the Tax-Advantaged Account, your rights may be affected by this Settlement, including the release and extinguishment of claims you may possess relating to the 2021 capital gains distributions from those funds. If you need assistance obtaining a detailed Notice of Pendency and Proposed Settlement of Class Action (“Notice”) and a copy of the Proof of Claim and Release Form (“Proof of Claim”), you may write to, call, or contact the Claims Administrator: Vanguard Chester Funds Litigation, c/o Strategic Claims Services, 600 N.

You can also download copies of the Notice and submit your Proof of Claim online at www.strategicclaims.net/vanguard. If you are a member of the Settlement Class, to share in the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund, you must submit a Proof of Claim electronically or to be received no later than February 3, 2026 by the Claims Administrator, establishing that you are entitled to share in the recovery. If you submitted a Proof of Claim for the proposed Prior Settlement in this Action, you do not need to submit a new Proof of Claim. If you are not sure whether the Claims Administrator already received a claim from you, please contact the Claims Administrator. Unless you submit a written exclusion request, you will be bound by any judgment rendered in the Action whether or not you make a claim. If you desire to be excluded from the Settlement Class, you must submit to the Claims Administrator a request for exclusion so that it is received no later than December 16, 2025, in the manner and form explained in the Notice. All members of the Settlement Class who have not requested exclusion from the Settlement Class will be bound by any judgment entered in the Action pursuant to the Stipulation.

Title: How ACHR Stock Rises 10x To $150?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) isn’t merely another aviation stock—it’s positioning itself at the heart of what could be the most revolutionary shift in urban transportation since the automobile. With six Midnight aircraft currently in production and three in final assembly at facilities in California and Georgia, the company is carefully working towards a commercial launch as the market starts to understand the significance of this opportunity. The figures reveal an early narrative: a $6 billion order book where each Midnight air taxi is valued at $5 million, alongside stock performance that has provided nearly 300% gains over the past year. However, here’s the reality—this $6 billion backlog is relatively insignificant compared to what we might be looking at in the long run. Consider the last time you found yourself stuck in traffic, watching time slip away, aware that you had an important appointment. Now visualize stepping out of your building, using your phone, and within minutes rising above the gridlock—no traffic signals, no congestion, simply a direct path to your destination. This isn’t futuristic fantasy any longer. The deep-seated human desire to overcome the limitations of ground transportation is real, and eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) technology finally makes it available. When individuals experience their first air taxi ride, they don’t merely encounter a new transportation method—they perceive liberation from the frustrations characteristic of modern commuting. Before we dive into the specifics, if you’re looking for an upside with less volatility than holding a single stock like ACHR, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. What’s the reason? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, see – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? Multiple factors are coming together to create a perfect scenario for massive growth: Let’s crunch the numbers on what substantial adoption entails. If Archer scales up to producing 2,000 units per year—feasible in a mature market serving major global cities—that signifies $10 billion in yearly revenue. With a 30% cash profit margin, you’re looking at $3 billion in annual profits. Using a reasonable 30x earnings multiple, this scenario values the company at $90 billion. That’s 10 times larger than the current $9 billion market cap. This isn’t about replacing every car journey—it’s about seizing the premium mobility market in high-density urban areas where time savings warrant higher costs. Consider business travelers, airport connections, emergency services, and ultimately, everyday commuters who prioritize time over cost. Fast-forward a decade, and we could potentially witness millions of air taxi rides globally. Just as Uber revolutionized ground transportation by making it accessible and convenient, eVTOL services could fundamentally alter how people navigate cities. The total addressable market stretches far beyond current transportation spending. By eliminating commute times, productivity and lifestyle enhancements unlock value that individuals are willing to pay premium prices for access. Business districts, airports, suburban-to-urban connections, and intercity travel all represent significant revenue opportunities. Of course, this transformation isn’t assured. Several factors could greatly impede growth: Keep in mind, investing in an individual stock without thorough analysis can carry risks. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. What’s the reason? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks allowed for responsiveness to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Archer Aviation stands at a pivotal juncture where technological capability, market demand, and regulatory frameworks are converging. The company's current valuation reflects early-stage execution risks, but the potential upside is truly remarkable. We aren’t just discussing a new product—we might be witnessing the emergence of an entirely new category of human mobility. For investors willing to accept the inherent risks of pioneering technology, Archer offers a rare opportunity to engage in what could develop into one of the most significant growth narratives of the coming decade. The question is not whether urban air mobility will materialize—it’s whether Archer can execute effectively enough to capture a substantial share of what promises to be a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity.

Title: How Time Became the Next Great Asset Class

In 1915, a Wall Street analyst named Benjamin Graham saw an opportunity. Guggenheim Exploration was trading as a single stock, but it held shares in multiple copper mining companies worth far more than the parent company’s price. Graham bought the undervalued parent, shorted the overvalued components, and waited. When the structure dissolved, he captured the spread exactly as he had hoped (and projected). Everyone was happy, especially Graham.

Δ That trade launched Graham’s career and established him as the de facto father of value investing. Over the next several decades, his Graham-Newman Partnership would generate above-average annualized returns by doing one thing very well: finding inefficiencies in markets and moving fast enough to capture them before those windows closed. From 1980 through 2003, Graham’s most famous protegee, Warren Buffett, used the same arbitrage principles to produce Berkshire Hathaway’s own above-average annualized returns. He did that by taking a page from Graham’s playbook: find investments with spreads between what it’s trading for today and what it’s worth tomorrow, then monetize the difference. Financial markets are built on spreads, the differences in price, risk or timing that smart investors use to create value. The best investors do not invent opportunity. Instead, they look for market inefficiencies and move fast enough to capture them before the market corrects. Now, a similar kind of spread has opened up in the daily lives of people and businesses. And it has nothing to do with currencies, stock markets or interest rates. It’s about the spread between what something once cost in time spent and what it costs now in time saved in the age of Gen AI. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Gen AI is giving people and businesses the capability to produce more, faster and better, with less time and effort. That difference, the time spread, can be captured, reinvested and compounded. It is the newest form of asset class: time arbitrage. In financial markets, arbitrage works because inefficiencies exist. In everyday life and business, inefficiency exists too. It shows up as friction. The waiting and reworking, the different hoops to jump through, the endless clicks and scrolls, approvals that take days and weeks to finalize, the hopscotching between apps and web sites and forms. It all amounts to the waste of the most precious of human assets: our time. Consider this from the business perspective. The average U.S. worker earns roughly $45 an hour and works roughly 1800 hours a year. If Gen AI eliminates just 15% of their low-value effort, that’s 270 hours of time returned per person. Or, using this formula, about $12,000 in annualized value for each worker. Across 163 million U.S. workers, that’s more than a $1.9 trillion productivity dividend, equal to 6.4% of the U.S. GDP. In other words, time that can be released for other productive work which can, in turn, boost GDP. To paraphrase the immortal words of Muhammad Ali, that ain’t nothing. Consumers experience the same phenomenon in their daily lives. Each year, they spend three hours just opening apps, and another six managing billing errors, rescheduling appointments, and fixing travel plans. That’s a more than a full workday of lost effort every year. Gen AI can eliminate much of that, compressing mundane tasks that took hours and days into milliseconds. Those reclaimed hours are the time spread, whether they are coming from improved business productivity or greater consumer productivity. They are the fuel for new value creation. So, there is no longer the question of whether we’ll save time. We will. The question becomes how people, businesses and the economy will reinvest it. Time has always been finite, but Gen AI has made it more liquid. It frees trapped capacity the same way financial innovation once freed trapped capital. Benjamin Franklin said, “Lost time is never found again.” But in a Gen AI-powered world, time can, in a sense, be reclaimed, multiplied and redeployed. Time arbitrage turns hours into capital that can be redeployed. Just as compound interest transformed investing, compounding time will transform productivity and creativity. Every hour saved using advanced AI becomes an hour that can be reinvested. In learning, invention, spending time with family, training a new pup, reading a book or doing absolutely nothing at all. And as with financial capital, the real advantage comes not from saving time, but from what consumers and businesses do with those extra hours. In finance, market makers create liquidity. They match buyers and sellers, price risk, and profit from the spread. In the time economy, the large language models such as GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, and others are the new market makers. In a sense, they set the “exchange rate” between human effort and machine output. A prompt can be thought of as the bid. An answer, design, video, ad copy or insight is the ask. Each interaction defines a new unit of efficiency. How much time it takes to achieve a result. ChatGPT turns a two-hour analysis into two minutes of synthesized context. Copilot organizes and prioritizes an overflowing inbox. Gemini drafts an investor brief or product roadmap in real time. Perplexity and Claude summarize hundreds of pages in seconds. All of these models are exploring how to monetize the spread in different ways, through subscription revenues or transaction fees on ecommerce purchases and on advertising. These models don’t just perform tasks; they create liquidity in time and they will monetize the friction they reduce or eliminate. And by doing that, they give every worker, creator and consumer a personal time arbitrage opportunity. And those models a way to monetize the spread. Despite media hype to the contrary, the most sophisticated companies aren’t just asking, “How do we save time?” They’re asking, “How do we reinvest our collective workforce capacity to become a different company?” Part of the answer may be that they don’t need as many workers, who then become available for other companies that do. When Klarna reported that it had deployed AI agents to handle customer service inquiries, the company claimed to have freed 1.4 million workhours annually. It said that it reallocated that capacity into fraud prevention innovation, new product development in business banking, and advanced credit risk analytics. Klarna claims that the value of that time arbitrage resulted in an estimated $40 million of annual profit improvement. AI revolutionized vaccine development by turning years-long processes into weeks using advanced algorithms. Moderna used them to develop its COVID-19 vaccine in just 42 days using 750+ active AI models. Pfizer’s Smart Data Query system analyzed data from 44,000 trial participants in real time, cutting trial validation from 30 days to 22 hours. These data-driven efficiencies compressed vaccine development to under 9 months, setting a new benchmark for AI-powered biomedical innovation. And new capacity for innovative thinking. Platforms like Uber, Lyft, Door Dash, Fivvr and others give consumers the ability to monetize idle capacity, on demand and as it suits them. Marketplaces and streaming platforms like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Spotify provide distribution for microprenuers to create and make sales. Gen AI has the potential to expand consumer capacity for those platforms and others by monetizing their “time equity.” Every free minute becomes a new potential opportunity for personal, business and economic growth. They are expanding the supply of ideas, products and services that fuel growth. Consumers don’t just create demand for products and services anymore. They create supply and do that at scale. The solopreneur building a brand on new found evening hours. The student launching a micro-SaaS business with weekend capacity. The retiree turning expertise into an AI-powered consulting practice. The single mom converting wait time at her daughter’s dance classes into a side-hustle. It’s a flywheel: Gen AI saves people time. People reinvest that time into creation, education or starting new businesses. Those outputs feed demand for smarter and better tools. Smarter tools save more time. More time equals more creation, education, businesses and business outcomes. In the industrial economy, supply was constrained by labor. In the time arbitrage economy, supply grows with every person who reinvests their time. McKinsey research suggests that if U.S. businesses shifted from extracting time savings as cost reductions to reinvesting them to support innovation, the economy could generate an additional $2 to 4 trillion in new output by 2030. Not from working more hours. From monetizing the time arbitrage. The space between what used to take days and what now takes minutes. Companies that use Gen AI only for cost reduction will see diminishing returns. The ones that reinvest time into innovation, using automation and autonomy to fund experimentation, R&D and creativity, will reap the benefits of the compounding of time across their workforce. This creates a compounding effect that traditional ROI doesn’t capture. Companies don’t just get more innovation per dollar; they get more kinds of innovation. From more people. With more perspectives. And that opens the door to bigger, more diverse breakthroughs. That’s the new kind of ROI, Return on Innovation, measured by how much more time can be spent moving from an idea to a finished product. When projects that once took months can now be tested in days, failure becomes affordable. When experiments cost hundreds of dollars instead of hundreds of thousands, people and companies are more willing to take calculated risks. When the time from idea to prototype shrinks from quarters to days, innovation stops being something only special teams do. It becomes part of everyone’s job, happening all the time, across the organization. With Gen AI, it’s possible for people work at the speed of their ideas. Previously, the lag between conception and manifestation created friction. Someone would have an idea, spend hours bringing it into being, getting consensus and building the business case. By the time they saw it realized, the thinking had moved on. Maybe so had the market opportunity. Time arbitrage makes creativity move in parallel streams. People can explore multiple paths at the same time. Test assumptions in real-time. Follow hunches without committing days and weeks to what could turn out to be dead ends. In a February 2025 Scientific American article, researchers published a study of the neuroscience of “aha” moments. We’ve all had them. The new idea that pops into your head out of the blue. On a run, or while making dinner or walking the dog. Scientists say that these flashes of “brilliance” are the result of a burst of high-frequency activity in the right temporal lobe, that palm-to-the-forehead moment that envisions a new twist or unsticks something that felt stuck. The brain, having stopped focusing on the task at hand, responds to being unincumbered by reassembling old information in a new way. Gen AI has the potential to create more of those moments. By handing off the mundane parts of day-to-day management at home or at the office, people can use their time arbitrage to focus on new thinking. Gen AI doesn’t create the aha moment, but it could give more people more opportunities to have them. Ben Graham spent his career teaching investors how to turn a dollar into two. He taught them to calculate intrinsic value, identify the spread and capture it before markets corrected. His students, like Warren Buffett, built fortunes on this single insight: inefficiency is an opportunity that can be monetized at scale. Graham died in 1976, decades before ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini existed. But he would have understood the impact of those tools on his thesis. The greatest market inefficiency we’ve ever seen isn’t in commodities or finance. It’s in how human time is valued and spent. Time has always been the scarcest yet most ubiquitous form of capital. Every person has a supply of time to spend. Now time is becoming the most liquid. In the Gen AI era, reclaimed time can be found, multiplied and reinvested. What used to take hours now takes minutes. What used to take days now takes hours. What used to require teams now requires prompts. The spread between old time costs and new time costs is massive. And it’s available to anyone with access to these tools. The question for every person and business is the same one Graham and his protegees asked about every investment: How to capture and reinvest the spread? For individuals, the return is new opportunity. For businesses, it is a new source of competitive advantage. For economies, it is the compounding effects of innovation with the potential to touch everyone and deliver change. At scale. Join the 18,000 subscribers who’ve already said yes to what’s NEXT.

Title: From 2x To 3x: Behind the Rise of Leveraged Single-Stock ETFs

A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com You might think 2025 has plenty of built-in risk. Some fund managers, however, are betting investors want more. A flurry of 3x filings hit the SEC’s desk this past week from Defiance ETFs, Themes ETFs and Direxion, according to a recent report from Bloomberg. ProShares also filed Monday for an array of single-stock offerings, holding companies like Amazon and Nvidia but also cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana and Ether. The products are the latest example of issuers displaying an appetite for risky ETFs and betting that regulators will prove willing to move beyond their prior opposition to 3x strategies. Despite the frenzy, however, experts said the average retail investor should be cautious about getting involved with 3x funds. “They’re great tools for day traders,” said Brian Glenn, chief investment officer at Premier Wealth. “For our space, wealth management, I think they’re generally horrible.” Leveraged ETFs work by amplifying the performance of their underlying holdings by a set multiple: if a stock is down 10%, its 2x leveraged ETF would be down 20%. In 2020, the last year of President Donald Trump’s first term, the SEC established a framework prohibiting the creation of new 3x leveraged ETFs, setting a maximum leverage of 2x. As a result, the approval path for current 3x filings is murky at best, with issuers likely betting on a more lax regulatory environment in Trump’s second term. “I’m not sure how exactly these new filings are betting on going through,” said Morningstar research analyst Lan Anh Tran. “It’s either a bet on a change in the framework at the SEC, or a change of mind from the regulators.” Other recent filers include: Glenn thinks the rising number of 3x filings is the result of a few developments. One is broker-dealers wanting to be a one-stop shop for investors; another is the rise of a prolific gambling culture. Many products will close as they lose assets and as the current crop of stocks they’re based on lose notoriety, he added. “In 20 years, with Tesla or Nvidia — it will be like today, if we had an IBM 3x ETF. No one really cares about trading IBM in a leveraged fashion,” Glenn said. “That’s just the life cycle of a company. I imagine as an individual product, they’ll cease to exist, and money leaves, and then they close down.” Useless Case? For most investors, leveraged single-stock funds aren’t a wise choice, Tran said. The only scenario in which they might work out well is with an underlying holding that increases slightly day by day, but that’s not typically how stocks move. “The more leverage you have … the more you have to make back [when the stock is down],” Tran said. “Usually they don’t make back that much to crawl themselves out of the hole that they dug themselves in.” Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. Semiliquid funds topped $450 billion in assets, but a handful of private credit ETFs have been slow to win over investors. ETFs that use artificial intelligence to select holdings have largely underperformed over the past five years. Many have closed. The company is reportedly considering adding third-party products to its brokerage,, but Vanguard said it hasn’t made any decisions. The ETF strategy lets wealthy investors defer, or even avoid, capital gains tax liabilities. Man Group is the latest to join the ETF bonanza, and it’s far from alone. The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: More CEOs demand ‘moonshot’ pay—billions in compensation for aggressive, seemingly impossible targets

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Good morning. If it seems like more CEOs are asking for—and getting—so-called “moonshot” pay packages, well, they are, as I reported in a recent feature for Fortune. A moonshot ties CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible targets over five to 10 years. The upshot is often billions in compensation and slices of company ownership. But in the meantime, the CEO gets almost nothing. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hit two moonshots, but the second award, once valued at $56 billion, was twice rescinded after a legal challenge. Taser stun gun and body camera company Axon Enterprise awarded its CEO Rick Smith a carbon copy of Musk’s deal in 2018 at a smaller magnitude. Smith blew the lights out and last year earned compensation valued at $165 million after growing the company’s market cap from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Smith even brought his entire workforce along with him by sharing some of his pay with employees, negotiating a deal where $88 million in stock went to the lowest-paid workers at Axon. His moonshot is also open to Axon workers, allowing them to put some of their pay at risk in a way similar to Smith’s comp. He’s now on a second seven-year moonshot plan, but even Smith’s wife was against the notion at first, because she thought it was just too risky. Now, the trend is poised to spread beyond founder-CEOs like Smith to what Todd Sirras of executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy calls “founder-anointed successors.” For instance, Opendoor Technologies CEO Kaz Nejatian got a potential $2.8 billion moonshot and a slice of the company after he was hired last month. But Sirras’ concern is that big bets on a single CEO pose major risks to shareholders. Human beings are emotional and they get distracted easily thinking about what they can buy with all this stock, he said, like a new private jet. He compared the potential rise of moonshot pay deals to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras said. While moonshots for founder-annointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T-Rex fence”—“awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland.” Read the full article here.—Amanda Gerut Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com AI bull run is too narrow, Morgan Stanley exec says Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer Lisa Shalett warned that the U.S. equity market’s remarkable run is built on a precariously narrow foundation: a surge in spending on, and optimistic assumptions about, infrastructure for artificial intelligence. This spending has fueled a boom in the shares of most of the so-called Magnificent 7 and a few dozen related businesses, which have now come to account for roughly 75% of the S&P 500’s returns since the rally began. AI companies may be underinsured, legally OpenAI and Anthropic may not be carrying enough insurance to pay all the legal claims against them from publishers whose work they have used to train their AI models, the FT reports. The companies may be required to use investor funds to pay off lawsuits. Kevin Kalinich, head of cyber risk at Aon, said “we don’t yet have enough capacity for [AI] providers”. SoftBank will buy ABB robotics for $5.4 billion “SoftBank’s next frontier is Physical AI. Together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics—driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward,” Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, said. Soybean farm crisis may need $24 billion bailout China, in response to President Trump’s trade war, has refused to buy U.S. soybeans this year, and it’s driving American farms into bankruptcy. Bailout packages for soy farms may cost taxpayers $24 billion, the WSJ reports, as the market for animal feed evaporates. Trump says federal workers may not get shutdown back pay “I would say it depends on who we’re talking about,” the president said yesterday, arguing that some workers “really don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way.” Red Lobster CEO’s recipe for a comeback 36-year-old Red Lobster CEO Damola Adamolekun is tasked with bringing the fast casual chain back to success following a tumultuous bankruptcy. He sees seafood boils and his own private equity savvy as ways ahead. Wall Street economist’s tariff predictions Wall Street economist Nathan Sheets told Fortune that the Trump Administration’s tariffs are unlike any we’ve seen “for many decades,” and could play out in two different ways. Retailers may subtly pass them off by raising prices during phases like the holiday season, though tariffs could also make some manufacturing unprofitable and bring about automation quicker. Elsewhere: Attorney General Pam Bondi refused to answer questions about her treatment of files held by the Justice Department that relate to President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein … The E.U. is considering new tariffs on steel imports by cutting the quota of steel that can be imported tariff-free and raising tariffs on the rest to 50% … Elon Musk’s Tesla launched two new, cheaper vehicles, priced at $40,000 for the Model Y and $37,000 for the Model 3.

Title: How American Tech Cartels Use Apps to Break the Law

Time Published: 2025-10-08T08:59:06Z

The death of competition spells doom for regulation. Competition is an essential component of effective regulation, for two reasons: First, competition keeps the companies within a sector from all telling the same lie to its regulators. Second, competition erodes companies’ profits and thus starves them of the capital they need to overpower or outmaneuver their regulators. While not all regulation is wise or helpful, a world without regulation is a catastrophe. That’s because, in a highly technological world, your ability to do well (or even to live out the day) requires that you correctly navigate innumerable highly technical questions that you can’t possibly answer. You need to know whether you can trust the software in your car’s antilock braking system, whether you should heed your doctor’s advice to get vaccinated, whether the joists over your head at home are sufficient to keep the ceiling from falling in and killing you, and whether your kids’ schooling is adequate or likely to turn them into ignoramuses. Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law. It’s not that you lack the intellect and discernment to answer each of these questions. You’re a smart cookie. Given enough time, you could get a PhD’s worth of education in software engineering, cell biology, material science, structural engineering, and pedagogy; investigate each of the offerings before you in each of these categories; and make an intelligent choice that reflects your priorities and the trade-offs you’re willing to make. The problem is that it would take you several lifetimes to acquire all that knowledge, and long before you could do so, you’d be killed by food poisoning because you guessed wrong about whether you could trust the hygiene policies at your local diner. It would be nice if you could let markets take care of these questions for you, but many of the consequences of wrong answers don’t manifest fast enough to steer your decision-making. Sure, if a private school turns one of your kids into an ignoramus, you can demand your money back and refuse to send your other kids to that school—but your kid is still an ignoramus. Likewise, you can punish a restaurant that gives you food poisoning by withholding your future custom, but if that’s a lethal poisoning, the fact that you don’t eat at that restaurant anymore isn’t quite the moral victory you might be hoping for. To navigate all of these technical minefields, you need the help of a third party. In a modern society, that third party is an expert regulator who investigates or anticipates problems in their area of expertise and then makes rules designed to solve these problems. To make these rules, the regulator convenes a truth-seeking exercise, in which all affected parties submit evidence about what the best rule should be and then get a chance to read what everyone else wrote and rebut their claims. Sometimes, there are in-person hearings, or successive rounds of comment and counter-comment, but that’s the basic shape of things. Once all the evidence is in, the regulator—who is a neutral expert, required to recuse themselves if they have conflicts—makes a rule, citing the evidence on which the rule is based. This whole system is backstopped by courts, which can order the process to begin anew if the new rule isn’t supported by the evidence created while the regulator was developing the record. This kind of adversarial process—something between a court case and scientific peer review—has a good track record of producing high-quality regulations. You can thank a process like this for the fact that you weren’t killed today by critters in your tap water or a high-voltage shock from one of your home’s electrical outlets. One key advantage of the process is that it relies on competitors to counter one another’s claims. The reinforced steel joist manufacturer that claims that only its products are suitable for use in high-rise apartment buildings will have to defend those claims against competitors who submit their own structural engineering and material science evidence. Regulators don’t need to look for holes in the arguments advanced by interested parties; they only need to assess the quality of the criticisms raised by other commenters who submit to the docket. This process isn’t just a way to prevent corporate executives from cheating the public by knowingly overpromising about their own products or denigrating their rivals’; it’s also a way to stop firms that have tricked themselves from fooling the rest of us, too. As with the scientific method, the safeguards of peer review help us catch grubby attempts at both deception and self-deception, because it’s very easy to talk yourself into a sincere belief that you are right and everyone else is wrong. This process works well on “disorganized” sectors composed of many firms that compete hard with one another. When hundreds of companies are all at one another’s throats, they suffer from a collective action problem—the same force that keeps users from leaving services like Facebook. Hundreds of companies find it impossible to agree on almost anything, including where to have a meeting in which they could discuss what line they are going to feed their regulator. They probably can’t even agree on how to cater that meeting. Hundreds of companies are a disorganized rabble. They can’t come to accord, and even if they could, a truly competitive sector produces smaller profits for each company (since one of the best ways to compete is by lowering prices to attract new customers and raising wages to attract the best workers). That leaves very little surplus capital with which to pursue regulatory adventures. But when a sector dwindles to five companies—or four, or three, or two, or just one—the collective action problem is annihilated by the inevitable coziness among the executives of the incestuous industries. After all, the executives in an industry dominated by a handful of firms are apt to have worked at most or all of the companies in the sector. They know one another, came up together, and are part of one another’s social milieu. Not only do concentrated industries find it easier to converge on a set of policy priorities and maintain message discipline while bargaining with their regulators, they also have a lot to bargain with. Concentrated sectors tend to have Mafia-style demarcations of turf. (Think of Pope Alexander VI dividing up the “New World” in 1494, of cable companies carving up the map of the United States into exclusive fiefdoms, or of Apple taking an annual $20 billion-plus payment from Google in exchange for not making its own search engine.) This prevents “wasteful competition” and allows these companies to amass gigantic war chests that they can mobilize to win their policy priorities. A hundred companies are a mob, a rabble. Five companies are a cartel. “Regulatory capture”—when a company suborns its regulator and teams up with it to screw over customers, rivals, and suppliers—starts with a regulator that is weaker than the company it is supposed to be watchdogging. The pro-monopoly policies of the past forty years have produced gigantic companies that find it easy to unite against their regulators, even as the deregulatory policies over the same period have starved regulators of the resources they need to fight back. The inevitable result is regulatory capture. * Regulatory capture has two faces: On the one hand, a captured industry is able to flout regulations that are meant to prevent it from harming the public, its employees and other stakeholders, and the environment. On the other hand, regulatory capture creates a coalition between the regulated industry and its regulators. They form a team and work together to enforce rules against other industries, startups, foreign adversaries, and so on. Regulatory capture isn’t the same as underregulation; rather, it is the combination of underregulation (for the industry that has effected the capture) and overregulation (against that industry’s enemies). Tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.” The most common tactic used to flout regulation is to break the law with an app and then insist that the law hasn’t been broken at all, because the crime was committed with an app. Sometimes literally (as Uber does when it argues that it’s not an employer because it directs its workers with an app) and sometimes figuratively. Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law. (“It’s not an illegal unregulated hotel, it’s an Airbnb!”) Riley Quinn, showrunner for the excellent Trashfuture podcast, says that whenever you hear the word fintech (financial technology), you should mentally substitute unregulated bank. App-based lending platforms ignore usury law and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app. Cryptocurrency hustlers illegally trade in unregistered securities and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app. When Uber entered the taxi market without securing taxi licenses or extending the workforce protections required under law, it said the move didn’t count because it did it with an app. The McDonald’s-backed company Plexure sells surveillance data on you to vendors, who use it to raise the price of items when they think you’ll pay more. In its promotional materials, Plexure uses the example of charging extra for your breakfast sandwich on payday. It says that such practices are not a rip-off because they’re done with an app. RealPage gives “recommendations” to landlords about the minimum rents they should charge for all the apartments in your neighborhood, raising rents and worsening the housing crisis. The company says it’s not price-fixing because it’s done with an app. On the subject of the housing crisis, Airbnb is racing to convert all the rental stock in your city into an unlicensed hotel room, but it says the conversion doesn’t count because it’s done with an app. The legal regime for apps really is different from the rules governing web pages. Thanks to intellectual property laws that ban “circumvention,” companies that embed undesirable anti-features in apps can use the law to destroy rivals that disenshittify their offerings. In other words, tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.” __________________________________ Excerpted from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow.

Most major corporations — from airlines to social media platforms — now aspire to become unregulated banks. Bankification today accounts for the highest profit margins in the US economy, crippling productive capacity and setting the stage for the next crash. Airlines lose money on flights and make windfall profits off credit cards and frequent-flyer programs that are bad for consumers. But the phenomenon isn’t limited to flying banks like Delta — almost every major US corporation now aspires to be a bank.

The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns about the effect of mixing nonbanks into the financial system. “It’s the recipe for a subprime crisis 2.0. Why would we want to see that play out again?” The quest to combine banking and commerce has been one of the holy grails of robber barons for centuries. In the nineteentth century, industry tycoons like John Pierpont Morgan and Jay Gould used their banking fortunes to finance the expansion of their own railroad projects. In the twentieth century, banking empires such as A.P. Giannini’s TransAmerica (now Bank of America) controlled manufacturing ventures from oil and gas to home construction and even frozen foods before Congress forced the conglomerates to divest from commercial enterprises. Bankification usually follows the same pattern: Once businesses dominate their market, monopolizing the heavy-industry sectors isn’t enough. Companies instead set their sights on acquiring the lifeblood of commerce: banking, where they can make money off of money by lending capital to be repaid with interest and collecting fees on financial transactions. Instead of haggling with risk-averse bankers or courting new investors for financing, corporations could set up their own financial institutions to receive customer deposits, tap these pools of capital to fund their own projects at better rates, and cut off banking access to competitors that encroach on their market share or unions that meddle with the business. Ever greater financialization, however, has crippled the American economy. After a wave of financial deregulation in the 1980s, Wall Street looked to expand beyond the bounds of traditional finance. In the corporate raider era, private equity firms and hedge funds began acquiring ever more Fortune 500 companies through buyouts and stock market ownership. The pressure to deliver shareholder returns pushed companies to outsource manufacturing jobs overseas, leaving the United States with an economy dominated by high finance and software technology. Despite industry titans’ plans for total control of the financial economy, lawmakers have long recognized that cross-ownership of banking and commerce would concentrate too much financial risk. “We treat banks as systemically important to our society, so we subsidize them as a public good through things like FDIC insurance, because if they go out of business, that’s a problem in a way that Macy’s going out of business isn’t,” explained Brad Lipton, the director of the corporate power and financial regulation program at the Roosevelt Institute and a former senior consumer financial protection regulator during the Biden administration. “You don’t want to mix the two.” Regulators first established a firm legal separation between the sectors with the National Banking Act of 1864, which codified rules for national banking charters. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shored up those rules, taking aim at the banking subsidiaries that conglomerates were using to circumvent regulations. But corporate America has continuously found ways to circumvent these legal prohibitions. The last major fight to ensure a clear separation between banking and commerce took place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lead-up to the disaster, which would result in over five million foreclosures and roughly ten million job losses, giant commercial firms like General Motors and General Electric used a decades-old legal loophole to operate “industrial loan companies.” These largely unregulated financial arms made poor lending decisions, such as acquiring growing portfolios of risky subprime mortgages. The mass defaults of these mortgages ultimately contributed to their owners’ bankruptcies, requiring federal bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, tried to put an end to these industrial banks by issuing a federal moratorium on new bank charters, among other banking reforms. But since then, a bold new wave of bankification has taken shape, further diverting companies’ resources from production to financial extraction. In 2020, a general partner at the venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz delivered a speech titled “Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company.” The presentation outlined the vision behind a nascent industry called “embedded finance,” urging companies of all kinds to integrate financial services into their operations or lose out on future growth. “Embedded finance” now appears in startup pitch decks and conference panels nearly as regularly as terms like AI and crypto, acting like a Pavlovian bell to get the attention of financiers for seed capital. “The business world realized that adding a financial services element to nearly every product is a way to supercharge their attractiveness to Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” said Seth Frotman, former general counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. Along with other major investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz now holds substantial stakes in these ventures. The venture capital fund has estimated that adding financial services, from selling insurance product warranties on goods to speeding up the online checkout process by leveraging data collection, can boost companies’ revenues by two to five times per customer and generate $230 billion in added revenue by the end of this year. Big Tech’s main focus so far has been payment processing services, for which they can charge fees on each transaction. Apple Pay, the largest of these networks, already boasts nearly 750 million active users worldwide and facilitates transactions worth trillions of dollars. Google, Meta, Amazon, and now even OpenAI also operate their own payment networks, which act as middlemen to facilitate contactless transactions and manage customers’ money. Along with financial technology companies like PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, these payment apps offer digital wallets, usually connected to customers’ bank accounts, that store balances and transfer funds. These payment networks have transformed the financial services industry so quickly that Wall Street banks are running scared. Despite these products’ ostensible convenience for consumers, payment processing services come with a variety of financial risks. For starters, while payment networks’ transaction fees are far lower than the credit card companies’ swipe fees, as these payment networks become more ubiquitous and acquire market power, rates could increase. Apple Pay collects a standard commission of less than a percent on every transaction, which in aggregate amounts to a billion-dollar windfall for the company. Tech companies are also effectively managing their customers’ digital balances without the protections of traditional financial institutions. When money sits in a bank account, it’s usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that reimburses depositors’ money if it disappears during an event like a bank run. But funds sitting in a Venmo account or a stored-value account in Apple Wallet are not insured. Financial regulators estimate that these payment apps are holding billions of dollars of completely uninsured deposits. If the apps suffered a technical glitch, got hacked, or unexpectedly went bankrupt, customers could lose their money. This happened in 2024 when Synapse, a technology company connecting fintech apps like Juno and Yotta with banks, suddenly collapsed, putting nearly one hundred thousand customers at risk of losing their life savings. Thousands did. Amanda Fischer, a financial policy expert at the research organization Better Markets, notes that there’s also a taxpayer risk if these payment processing services collapse. With their current growth rate, tech giants’ banking footprints could become “too big to fail,” potentially requiring a taxpayer bailout to avoid a nationwide economic collapse. “Imagine the millions of people that use Amazon are now maintaining balances on their account, and something goes wrong with Amazon corporate,” said Fischer, who served as the chief of staff and senior counselor to the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “It’s a really good way to take the U.S. government hostage.” There’s another concern: A driving factor behind Big Tech’s payments networks — as with all embedded finance — is the new opportunities it provides for consumer surveillance. “Payments have gone from this really sleepy blackwater to the cutting-edge forefront of consumer issues, and a lot of that is due to the monetization of financial data,” said Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau general counsel. Frotman added that users’ financial information is one of the last remaining frontiers for data privacy. That’s because sensitive financial data, unlike online shopping patterns or location tracking, has typically been well protected at tightly regulated banking institutions. By running payment networks, Google, Meta, and Amazon have a God’s-eye view into financial transactions that take place not just on their own platforms but across others when users pay with their digital wallets. In a 2023 speech, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said that the tech firms “have a strong incentive to surveil all aspects of a consumer’s transactions, since this data can advantage the rest of their businesses.” By identifying users’ purchasing habits, tech companies could exploit those tendencies to sell people more goods or keep them on the platform. What’s more, by controlling banking services, tech companies can also cut users out of the financial system for any reason, in a process called “debanking.” “Corporate surveillance activities can also raise a range of questions about espionage, tracking, and censorship,” said Chopra. Simultaneously, Silicon Valley’s entry into banking has also created a countervailing bankification effect: Threatened by Big Tech’s encroachment, Wall Street firms are now trying to edge into tech’s core business. JPMorgan, for example, launched an advertising brokerage last year to compete with Big Tech’s digital advertising empire. It’s more likely than not that bankification is already hiding in plain sight in your wallet. While your credit cards used to be simply branded with big bank names like Chase, Capital One, and American Express, now they’re often linked to specific corporate brands, like Costco, Disney, Netflix, and even NASCAR. More and more businesses, especially in retail, are offering credit cards to encourage consumer spending on their brands. More than half of the country’s top one hundred retailers, for example, now offer their own business-specific credit cards, including Target, Macy’s, and Nordstrom. The resulting revenues, split between businesses and the partnered credit card companies, are highly lucrative. For the top segment of large retailers, payments on store-specific cards generate up to 14 percent of company profits, a critical income stream for businesses operating on relatively thin profit margins. If not for the hundreds of millions it makes from its widely used credit cards, the Kohl’s department store chain would be in the red. No sector is more dependent on its credit cards than the airline industry. Even though all of the country’s major airlines lost money on flying passengers last year, the companies still earned billions in operating profits — mostly from revenues they earned from unregulated frequent-flier programs they operate through branded credit cards. In 2023, Delta Air Lines, the world’s most lucrative airline, generated the bulk of its $4.6 billion in operating income from its deal with American Express, and so far this year, nearly all of its earnings have come from the credit card company. This arrangement led the legal scholar and airline expert Ganesh Sitharaman to conclude that “frequent-flier [points] systems… turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side.” While these frequent-flier programs promise rewards like discounted seats or free flights, experts say these perks are rarely good deals for consumers. As recent investigations and government probes have revealed, airlines have been known to put their thumbs on the scale to devalue and distort points when it helps their bottom line. That includes a 2024 Department of Transportation investigation that probed the airlines for systematically devaluing their point systems and raising reward thresholds to reduce the number of free flights and other perks offered to customers. “Airlines will [deviate] the point prices compared to the dollar price… in order to affect the overall value of the monetary supply of points,” said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator. “It’s almost as though they’re acting like their own central bankers.” For example, Delta in 2023 switched the metric for its SkyMiles points system from miles traveled to total customer spending, which dramatically devalued the points accrued by its customers. The changes were met with widespread outrage by budget-conscious travelers, since their flights would no longer generate as many points. One well-known blogger at the credit card–focused travel site The Points Guy declared that he would “stop chasing airline status.” Similarly, credit card reward programs in other industries rarely pay off for customers. “Consumers think they’re getting convenience, but businesses get new ways to monetize your data and make revenue [off] you,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The trade-off in the end balances out to favor companies in ways many consumers don’t realize in terms of the security and privacy of their money and data.” At a basic level, loyalty rewards work similarly to a punch card at a coffee shop. The difference is that credit card rewards programs use far more sophisticated financial tools and technology to create a vastly more intricate system that stacks the deck in favor of companies’ bottom lines. Take Starbucks and Dunkin’, which run two of the country’s largest retail rewards programs. Starbucks boasts over thirty million users, while Dunkin’ claims over ten million. Both programs reward customers with a free coffee if they preload a certain amount of money onto their digital rewards apps, to be used at the stores’ locations. The total balances held across these digital apps have exploded, in Starbucks’ case to nearly $2 billion, larger than the balances managed by many small- and medium-sized banks — except without any of the same regulatory oversight. A significant portion of the clientele who sign up for these programs forget about their balances and never spend them. Customers have essentially placed their money in a savings account that accrues no interest, while giving these conglomerates an interest-free loan to use at the company’s discretion. If Starbucks or Dunkin’ ever experienced financial difficulties or went out of business, these digital funds could evaporate. That might not be as implausible as it sounds, considering how Wall Street firms have acquired and stripped once-powerful retail empires like Toys “R” Us for parts. When the private equity-backed bowling alley chain Bowlero merged with bowling competitor Lucky Strike and rebranded in 2023, the balances that customers had stored on their Bowlero rewards card vanished overnight. Loyalty reward scams aren’t the only problem with retail credit cards. For one thing, the cost of such credit cards is usually higher than that of non-retail cards. In 2024, 90 percent of retail credit cards had annual percentage rates (APR) above 30 percent, compared to just a third of other cards. According to government regulators, retail credit cards are, in general, among the most expensive credit options, thanks to their excessive fees and interest charges. These high fees are so important to the credit card companies that a Biden administration rule to cap late fees at $8 threatened to significantly cut into industry profits. The Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, immediately sued the agency to block the rule. To take advantage of these high fees, retailers are forcing their workers to become credit card salesmen. “Companies are enlisting low-wage workers to target other low-wage earners with predatory products,” said Frotman. At employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, retail workers’ compensation is reportedly dependent in part on hitting sales quotas for signing customers up for store credit cards. Such requirements have become the source of contract disputes during union bargaining at some stores. With their salaries on the line, retail workers are often forced to hawk cards to customers without adequate training to evaluate creditworthiness. For this reason, regulators have warned that the underwriting standards for retail cards are less stringent, which may be driving customers into bad deals and debt. “Does anyone think this is going to end well?” asked Frotman. On average, retail cardholders are more likely than other credit card customers to carry a balance and only pay the minimum monthly amount due, which increases the likelihood of going into debt, according to government findings. In health care, the peddling of credit cards can be even more exploitative, contributing to the nation’s ballooning medical debt crisis. For the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or aren’t fully covered, doctors and nurses are now offering these cards or other installment loans to help them pay their medical bills. While these cards were historically offered just for elective procedures, they’re increasingly being promoted for basic health expenses and medical emergencies. CareCredit from Synchrony Financial, one of the largest financial players in the medical space, now carries 11.7 million cardholders and lists over 250,000 health care partners. While medical credit cards can reduce care providers’ billing and administration costs, regulators have found that the sale of these cards often comes with minimal disclosure of the unforgiving terms, high rates, and other predatory practices. In some instances, the cards have been sold to patients whose procedures, unbeknownst to them, might have been covered by their insurance or nonprofit hospitals’ bill-forgiveness programs. “We transcribed phone calls that we had with hospitals to kind of show how they’re softly nudging people toward these payment products,” said Eli Rushbanks, the general counsel at the patient advocacy nonprofit Dollar For, which submitted a public comment in 2023 calling for a government inquiry into the matter. “We took screenshots of websites that really blend the ideas of what’s Medicaid, what’s charity care, and what’s a payment plan under just sort of a nebulous umbrella of financial assistance.” The American Prospect even reported that regulators have learned of instances in which patients had no memory of agreeing to use a medical credit card. It turned out that they had been signed up for the service while they were under anesthesia. In their quest to embrace embedded finance, companies are venturing into new, unregulated areas of banking and lending. Rideshare apps Uber and Lyft have developed company-issued debit cards, payment processing apps, and even in-house auto lending programs that they offer to their drivers. These payment services aren’t covered by the FDIC, and the lending arms have been taken to court for illegal, exploitative practices such as charging higher interest rates than the industry average. All of these financial arrangements threaten to lock rideshare workers into their jobs, as their employer serves as their de facto banker. Amazon similarly began offering workers a product called “earned wage access,” which lends them their salary before payday, putting them in debt to their boss. The earned-wage-access industry has been criticized for exploiting low-income workers by charging steep penalties for late payments. Most prominently, big-box retailers and grocery stores are increasingly offering “buy now, pay later” options at checkout, providing consumers short-term financing for purchases that they often can’t afford. Buy now, pay later is a short-term financing option that provides smaller loans to be paid back in incremental installments. Sometimes promoted as zero-interest loans, buy now, pay later options often involve costly late fees and sneaky terms that can saddle borrowers with sky-high interest rates if they don’t pay off the loan on time. While buy now, pay later programs often charge merchants higher transaction fees than credit cards, nearly all major chain stores now offer the option because it helps generate more sales. A number of companies, including Costco, are now integrating buy now, pay later options from providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay directly into their websites and apps to capture a larger share of the resulting revenues. These deals encourage retailers to push a largely unregulated financial product. Over a quarter of all Americans now use buy now, pay later programs, and according to a recent survey from LendingTree, roughly 25 percent of those customers regularly use the option to pay for basic items like groceries. Even more concerning, 40 percent of buy now, pay later borrowers reported missing at least one of their installment payments, leading to late fees. “The marketing of buy now, pay later loans can make them appear to be a zero-risk credit option,” read a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report identifying “several areas of risk of consumer harm.” The report concluded that borrowers with buy now, pay later plans were more likely “to be highly indebted,” to “have delinquencies in traditional credit products,” and to exhibit “high levels of financial distress.” The agency’s assessment also noted that buy now, pay later lenders may be engaging in a form of “regulatory arbitrage” by strategically operating in the shadows and avoiding stricter legal standards imposed on other financial markets. Along with preying on consumers, embedded finance also targets small, independent businesses. Fintech companies such as Shopify, PayPal, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square offer business-management services for nascent enterprises, including transaction processing, one of the biggest logjams in digital retail. But these benefits come with a catch: The platforms steer small businesses toward merchant cash advances, a virtually unregulated financial service that’s been accused of exploitative practices. Merchant cash advances provide businesses with lines of credit, but instead of expecting direct reimbursement, lenders take a fixed percentage of the businesses’ sales until the end of the loan term. By arguing that their product is not a loan covered by financial regulations but rather an investment in their borrowers’ business, merchant cash advance providers are free to saddle businesses with exorbitantly high payments and avoid state caps on excessive interest charges. America’s long-standing efforts to separate banking and commerce haven’t kept up with the breakneck growth of nonbank financial institutions. While these businesses engage in many of the same kinds of lending as banks, they don’t accept traditional commercial deposits. That means they’re not subject to the same regulatory oversight from banking authorities tasked with protecting consumers from financial risk. The digital app Juno, for example, advertised itself as a “complete replacement for banking” with better savings rates — except without consumer protections like FDIC insurance. So when Synapse, a software company that Juno relied on for back-end tech services, collapsed in 2024, many Juno customers lost their entire savings. During the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies pursued a range of actions and investigations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the burgeoning embedded-finance market. Government investigators probed predatory practices in retail credit cards, medical debt loans, buy now, pay later services, and digital payment apps. Some of the probes led to new regulations, such as a 2024 rule that extended financial regulators’ supervisory authority to Big Tech payment platforms and regulated them as strictly as banks. That rule drew ire from the tech industry and was immediately terminated by the Trump administration, along with a host of other Biden-era financial reforms. Since then, one of the country’s top financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been systematically dismantled under the direction of the White House. The Trump administration has even indicated it will reopen applications for industrial loan companies, the auto industry–owned banks that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. The news inspired each of the country’s Big Four auto companies to file new applications to operate their own banks. The result is that consumers have been left to navigate the strange new world of bankification on their own — with troubling consequences. Take Paula, a Florida resident, who had to undergo an emergency dental procedure that cost thousands of dollars. Her insurer wouldn’t cover it, so her dental practice recommended she sign up for a CareCredit payment plan to afford the bill. According to a public comment letter submitted to consumer regulators by the advocacy group Consumer Reports on her behalf, Paula paid the requested amount each month — but when the plan’s zero-interest promotional period expired, she still had a remaining balance of $700, so interest payments kicked in. The following month, Paula’s bill doubled to $1,400. It turned out that thanks to Care Credit’s unregulated fine print, the company charged interest on the total up-front cost of her medical bill, rather than her remaining balance. For Paula, the frictionless convenience offered by embedded finance wasn’t a panacea — it was a debt trap. As she put it bluntly in her comment letter, “I would rather be in pain and suffer than pay the exorbitant interest charged to me.” This article was first published by the Lever, an award-winning independent investigative newsroom.

Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns about the effect of mixing nonbanks into the financial system. “It’s the recipe for a subprime crisis 2.0. Why would we want to see that play out again?” The quest to combine banking and commerce has been one of the holy grails of robber barons for centuries. In the nineteentth century, industry tycoons like John Pierpont Morgan and Jay Gould used their banking fortunes to finance the expansion of their own railroad projects. In the twentieth century, banking empires such as A.P. Giannini’s TransAmerica (now Bank of America) controlled manufacturing ventures from oil and gas to home construction and even frozen foods before Congress forced the conglomerates to divest from commercial enterprises. Bankification usually follows the same pattern: Once businesses dominate their market, monopolizing the heavy-industry sectors isn’t enough. Companies instead set their sights on acquiring the lifeblood of commerce: banking, where they can make money off of money by lending capital to be repaid with interest and collecting fees on financial transactions. Instead of haggling with risk-averse bankers or courting new investors for financing, corporations could set up their own financial institutions to receive customer deposits, tap these pools of capital to fund their own projects at better rates, and cut off banking access to competitors that encroach on their market share or unions that meddle with the business. Ever greater financialization, however, has crippled the American economy. After a wave of financial deregulation in the 1980s, Wall Street looked to expand beyond the bounds of traditional finance. In the corporate raider era, private equity firms and hedge funds began acquiring ever more Fortune 500 companies through buyouts and stock market ownership. The pressure to deliver shareholder returns pushed companies to outsource manufacturing jobs overseas, leaving the United States with an economy dominated by high finance and software technology. Despite industry titans’ plans for total control of the financial economy, lawmakers have long recognized that cross-ownership of banking and commerce would concentrate too much financial risk. “We treat banks as systemically important to our society, so we subsidize them as a public good through things like FDIC insurance, because if they go out of business, that’s a problem in a way that Macy’s going out of business isn’t,” explained Brad Lipton, the director of the corporate power and financial regulation program at the Roosevelt Institute and a former senior consumer financial protection regulator during the Biden administration. “You don’t want to mix the two.” Regulators first established a firm legal separation between the sectors with the National Banking Act of 1864, which codified rules for national banking charters. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shored up those rules, taking aim at the banking subsidiaries that conglomerates were using to circumvent regulations. But corporate America has continuously found ways to circumvent these legal prohibitions. The last major fight to ensure a clear separation between banking and commerce took place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lead-up to the disaster, which would result in over five million foreclosures and roughly ten million job losses, giant commercial firms like General Motors and General Electric used a decades-old legal loophole to operate “industrial loan companies.” These largely unregulated financial arms made poor lending decisions, such as acquiring growing portfolios of risky subprime mortgages. The mass defaults of these mortgages ultimately contributed to their owners’ bankruptcies, requiring federal bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, tried to put an end to these industrial banks by issuing a federal moratorium on new bank charters, among other banking reforms. But since then, a bold new wave of bankification has taken shape, further diverting companies’ resources from production to financial extraction. In 2020, a general partner at the venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz delivered a speech titled “Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company.” The presentation outlined the vision behind a nascent industry called “embedded finance,” urging companies of all kinds to integrate financial services into their operations or lose out on future growth. “Embedded finance” now appears in startup pitch decks and conference panels nearly as regularly as terms like AI and crypto, acting like a Pavlovian bell to get the attention of financiers for seed capital. “The business world realized that adding a financial services element to nearly every product is a way to supercharge their attractiveness to Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” said Seth Frotman, former general counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. Along with other major investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz now holds substantial stakes in these ventures. The venture capital fund has estimated that adding financial services, from selling insurance product warranties on goods to speeding up the online checkout process by leveraging data collection, can boost companies’ revenues by two to five times per customer and generate $230 billion in added revenue by the end of this year. Big Tech’s main focus so far has been payment processing services, for which they can charge fees on each transaction. Apple Pay, the largest of these networks, already boasts nearly 750 million active users worldwide and facilitates transactions worth trillions of dollars. Google, Meta, Amazon, and now even OpenAI also operate their own payment networks, which act as middlemen to facilitate contactless transactions and manage customers’ money. Along with financial technology companies like PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, these payment apps offer digital wallets, usually connected to customers’ bank accounts, that store balances and transfer funds. These payment networks have transformed the financial services industry so quickly that Wall Street banks are running scared. Despite these products’ ostensible convenience for consumers, payment processing services come with a variety of financial risks. For starters, while payment networks’ transaction fees are far lower than the credit card companies’ swipe fees, as these payment networks become more ubiquitous and acquire market power, rates could increase. Apple Pay collects a standard commission of less than a percent on every transaction, which in aggregate amounts to a billion-dollar windfall for the company. Tech companies are also effectively managing their customers’ digital balances without the protections of traditional financial institutions. When money sits in a bank account, it’s usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that reimburses depositors’ money if it disappears during an event like a bank run. But funds sitting in a Venmo account or a stored-value account in Apple Wallet are not insured. Financial regulators estimate that these payment apps are holding billions of dollars of completely uninsured deposits. If the apps suffered a technical glitch, got hacked, or unexpectedly went bankrupt, customers could lose their money. This happened in 2024 when Synapse, a technology company connecting fintech apps like Juno and Yotta with banks, suddenly collapsed, putting nearly one hundred thousand customers at risk of losing their life savings. Thousands did. Amanda Fischer, a financial policy expert at the research organization Better Markets, notes that there’s also a taxpayer risk if these payment processing services collapse. With their current growth rate, tech giants’ banking footprints could become “too big to fail,” potentially requiring a taxpayer bailout to avoid a nationwide economic collapse. “Imagine the millions of people that use Amazon are now maintaining balances on their account, and something goes wrong with Amazon corporate,” said Fischer, who served as the chief of staff and senior counselor to the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “It’s a really good way to take the U.S. government hostage.” There’s another concern: A driving factor behind Big Tech’s payments networks — as with all embedded finance — is the new opportunities it provides for consumer surveillance. “Payments have gone from this really sleepy blackwater to the cutting-edge forefront of consumer issues, and a lot of that is due to the monetization of financial data,” said Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau general counsel. Frotman added that users’ financial information is one of the last remaining frontiers for data privacy. That’s because sensitive financial data, unlike online shopping patterns or location tracking, has typically been well protected at tightly regulated banking institutions. By running payment networks, Google, Meta, and Amazon have a God’s-eye view into financial transactions that take place not just on their own platforms but across others when users pay with their digital wallets. In a 2023 speech, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said that the tech firms “have a strong incentive to surveil all aspects of a consumer’s transactions, since this data can advantage the rest of their businesses.” By identifying users’ purchasing habits, tech companies could exploit those tendencies to sell people more goods or keep them on the platform. What’s more, by controlling banking services, tech companies can also cut users out of the financial system for any reason, in a process called “debanking.” “Corporate surveillance activities can also raise a range of questions about espionage, tracking, and censorship,” said Chopra. Simultaneously, Silicon Valley’s entry into banking has also created a countervailing bankification effect: Threatened by Big Tech’s encroachment, Wall Street firms are now trying to edge into tech’s core business. JPMorgan, for example, launched an advertising brokerage last year to compete with Big Tech’s digital advertising empire. It’s more likely than not that bankification is already hiding in plain sight in your wallet. While your credit cards used to be simply branded with big bank names like Chase, Capital One, and American Express, now they’re often linked to specific corporate brands, like Costco, Disney, Netflix, and even NASCAR. More and more businesses, especially in retail, are offering credit cards to encourage consumer spending on their brands. More than half of the country’s top one hundred retailers, for example, now offer their own business-specific credit cards, including Target, Macy’s, and Nordstrom. The resulting revenues, split between businesses and the partnered credit card companies, are highly lucrative. For the top segment of large retailers, payments on store-specific cards generate up to 14 percent of company profits, a critical income stream for businesses operating on relatively thin profit margins. If not for the hundreds of millions it makes from its widely used credit cards, the Kohl’s department store chain would be in the red. No sector is more dependent on its credit cards than the airline industry. Even though all of the country’s major airlines lost money on flying passengers last year, the companies still earned billions in operating profits — mostly from revenues they earned from unregulated frequent-flier programs they operate through branded credit cards. In 2023, Delta Air Lines, the world’s most lucrative airline, generated the bulk of its $4.6 billion in operating income from its deal with American Express, and so far this year, nearly all of its earnings have come from the credit card company. This arrangement led the legal scholar and airline expert Ganesh Sitharaman to conclude that “frequent-flier [points] systems… turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side.” While these frequent-flier programs promise rewards like discounted seats or free flights, experts say these perks are rarely good deals for consumers. As recent investigations and government probes have revealed, airlines have been known to put their thumbs on the scale to devalue and distort points when it helps their bottom line. That includes a 2024 Department of Transportation investigation that probed the airlines for systematically devaluing their point systems and raising reward thresholds to reduce the number of free flights and other perks offered to customers. “Airlines will [deviate] the point prices compared to the dollar price… in order to affect the overall value of the monetary supply of points,” said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator. “It’s almost as though they’re acting like their own central bankers.” For example, Delta in 2023 switched the metric for its SkyMiles points system from miles traveled to total customer spending, which dramatically devalued the points accrued by its customers. The changes were met with widespread outrage by budget-conscious travelers, since their flights would no longer generate as many points. One well-known blogger at the credit card–focused travel site The Points Guy declared that he would “stop chasing airline status.” Similarly, credit card reward programs in other industries rarely pay off for customers. “Consumers think they’re getting convenience, but businesses get new ways to monetize your data and make revenue [off] you,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The trade-off in the end balances out to favor companies in ways many consumers don’t realize in terms of the security and privacy of their money and data.” At a basic level, loyalty rewards work similarly to a punch card at a coffee shop. The difference is that credit card rewards programs use far more sophisticated financial tools and technology to create a vastly more intricate system that stacks the deck in favor of companies’ bottom lines. Take Starbucks and Dunkin’, which run two of the country’s largest retail rewards programs. Starbucks boasts over thirty million users, while Dunkin’ claims over ten million. Both programs reward customers with a free coffee if they preload a certain amount of money onto their digital rewards apps, to be used at the stores’ locations. The total balances held across these digital apps have exploded, in Starbucks’ case to nearly $2 billion, larger than the balances managed by many small- and medium-sized banks — except without any of the same regulatory oversight. A significant portion of the clientele who sign up for these programs forget about their balances and never spend them. Customers have essentially placed their money in a savings account that accrues no interest, while giving these conglomerates an interest-free loan to use at the company’s discretion. If Starbucks or Dunkin’ ever experienced financial difficulties or went out of business, these digital funds could evaporate. That might not be as implausible as it sounds, considering how Wall Street firms have acquired and stripped once-powerful retail empires like Toys “R” Us for parts. When the private equity-backed bowling alley chain Bowlero merged with bowling competitor Lucky Strike and rebranded in 2023, the balances that customers had stored on their Bowlero rewards card vanished overnight. Loyalty reward scams aren’t the only problem with retail credit cards. For one thing, the cost of such credit cards is usually higher than that of non-retail cards. In 2024, 90 percent of retail credit cards had annual percentage rates (APR) above 30 percent, compared to just a third of other cards. According to government regulators, retail credit cards are, in general, among the most expensive credit options, thanks to their excessive fees and interest charges. These high fees are so important to the credit card companies that a Biden administration rule to cap late fees at $8 threatened to significantly cut into industry profits. The Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, immediately sued the agency to block the rule. To take advantage of these high fees, retailers are forcing their workers to become credit card salesmen. “Companies are enlisting low-wage workers to target other low-wage earners with predatory products,” said Frotman. At employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, retail workers’ compensation is reportedly dependent in part on hitting sales quotas for signing customers up for store credit cards. Such requirements have become the source of contract disputes during union bargaining at some stores. With their salaries on the line, retail workers are often forced to hawk cards to customers without adequate training to evaluate creditworthiness. For this reason, regulators have warned that the underwriting standards for retail cards are less stringent, which may be driving customers into bad deals and debt. “Does anyone think this is going to end well?” asked Frotman. On average, retail cardholders are more likely than other credit card customers to carry a balance and only pay the minimum monthly amount due, which increases the likelihood of going into debt, according to government findings. In health care, the peddling of credit cards can be even more exploitative, contributing to the nation’s ballooning medical debt crisis. For the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or aren’t fully covered, doctors and nurses are now offering these cards or other installment loans to help them pay their medical bills. While these cards were historically offered just for elective procedures, they’re increasingly being promoted for basic health expenses and medical emergencies. CareCredit from Synchrony Financial, one of the largest financial players in the medical space, now carries 11.7 million cardholders and lists over 250,000 health care partners. While medical credit cards can reduce care providers’ billing and administration costs, regulators have found that the sale of these cards often comes with minimal disclosure of the unforgiving terms, high rates, and other predatory practices. In some instances, the cards have been sold to patients whose procedures, unbeknownst to them, might have been covered by their insurance or nonprofit hospitals’ bill-forgiveness programs. “We transcribed phone calls that we had with hospitals to kind of show how they’re softly nudging people toward these payment products,” said Eli Rushbanks, the general counsel at the patient advocacy nonprofit Dollar For, which submitted a public comment in 2023 calling for a government inquiry into the matter. “We took screenshots of websites that really blend the ideas of what’s Medicaid, what’s charity care, and what’s a payment plan under just sort of a nebulous umbrella of financial assistance.” The American Prospect even reported that regulators have learned of instances in which patients had no memory of agreeing to use a medical credit card. It turned out that they had been signed up for the service while they were under anesthesia. In their quest to embrace embedded finance, companies are venturing into new, unregulated areas of banking and lending. Rideshare apps Uber and Lyft have developed company-issued debit cards, payment processing apps, and even in-house auto lending programs that they offer to their drivers. These payment services aren’t covered by the FDIC, and the lending arms have been taken to court for illegal, exploitative practices such as charging higher interest rates than the industry average. All of these financial arrangements threaten to lock rideshare workers into their jobs, as their employer serves as their de facto banker. Amazon similarly began offering workers a product called “earned wage access,” which lends them their salary before payday, putting them in debt to their boss. The earned-wage-access industry has been criticized for exploiting low-income workers by charging steep penalties for late payments. Most prominently, big-box retailers and grocery stores are increasingly offering “buy now, pay later” options at checkout, providing consumers short-term financing for purchases that they often can’t afford. Buy now, pay later is a short-term financing option that provides smaller loans to be paid back in incremental installments. Sometimes promoted as zero-interest loans, buy now, pay later options often involve costly late fees and sneaky terms that can saddle borrowers with sky-high interest rates if they don’t pay off the loan on time. While buy now, pay later programs often charge merchants higher transaction fees than credit cards, nearly all major chain stores now offer the option because it helps generate more sales. A number of companies, including Costco, are now integrating buy now, pay later options from providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay directly into their websites and apps to capture a larger share of the resulting revenues. These deals encourage retailers to push a largely unregulated financial product. Over a quarter of all Americans now use buy now, pay later programs, and according to a recent survey from LendingTree, roughly 25 percent of those customers regularly use the option to pay for basic items like groceries. Even more concerning, 40 percent of buy now, pay later borrowers reported missing at least one of their installment payments, leading to late fees. “The marketing of buy now, pay later loans can make them appear to be a zero-risk credit option,” read a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report identifying “several areas of risk of consumer harm.” The report concluded that borrowers with buy now, pay later plans were more likely “to be highly indebted,” to “have delinquencies in traditional credit products,” and to exhibit “high levels of financial distress.” The agency’s assessment also noted that buy now, pay later lenders may be engaging in a form of “regulatory arbitrage” by strategically operating in the shadows and avoiding stricter legal standards imposed on other financial markets. Along with preying on consumers, embedded finance also targets small, independent businesses. Fintech companies such as Shopify, PayPal, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square offer business-management services for nascent enterprises, including transaction processing, one of the biggest logjams in digital retail. But these benefits come with a catch: The platforms steer small businesses toward merchant cash advances, a virtually unregulated financial service that’s been accused of exploitative practices. Merchant cash advances provide businesses with lines of credit, but instead of expecting direct reimbursement, lenders take a fixed percentage of the businesses’ sales until the end of the loan term. By arguing that their product is not a loan covered by financial regulations but rather an investment in their borrowers’ business, merchant cash advance providers are free to saddle businesses with exorbitantly high payments and avoid state caps on excessive interest charges. America’s long-standing efforts to separate banking and commerce haven’t kept up with the breakneck growth of nonbank financial institutions. While these businesses engage in many of the same kinds of lending as banks, they don’t accept traditional commercial deposits. That means they’re not subject to the same regulatory oversight from banking authorities tasked with protecting consumers from financial risk. The digital app Juno, for example, advertised itself as a “complete replacement for banking” with better savings rates — except without consumer protections like FDIC insurance. So when Synapse, a software company that Juno relied on for back-end tech services, collapsed in 2024, many Juno customers lost their entire savings. During the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies pursued a range of actions and investigations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the burgeoning embedded-finance market. Government investigators probed predatory practices in retail credit cards, medical debt loans, buy now, pay later services, and digital payment apps. Some of the probes led to new regulations, such as a 2024 rule that extended financial regulators’ supervisory authority to Big Tech payment platforms and regulated them as strictly as banks. That rule drew ire from the tech industry and was immediately terminated by the Trump administration, along with a host of other Biden-era financial reforms. Since then, one of the country’s top financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been systematically dismantled under the direction of the White House. The Trump administration has even indicated it will reopen applications for industrial loan companies, the auto industry–owned banks that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. The news inspired each of the country’s Big Four auto companies to file new applications to operate their own banks. The result is that consumers have been left to navigate the strange new world of bankification on their own — with troubling consequences. Take Paula, a Florida resident, who had to undergo an emergency dental procedure that cost thousands of dollars. Her insurer wouldn’t cover it, so her dental practice recommended she sign up for a CareCredit payment plan to afford the bill. According to a public comment letter submitted to consumer regulators by the advocacy group Consumer Reports on her behalf, Paula paid the requested amount each month — but when the plan’s zero-interest promotional period expired, she still had a remaining balance of $700, so interest payments kicked in. The following month, Paula’s bill doubled to $1,400. It turned out that thanks to Care Credit’s unregulated fine print, the company charged interest on the total up-front cost of her medical bill, rather than her remaining balance. For Paula, the frictionless convenience offered by embedded finance wasn’t a panacea — it was a debt trap. As she put it bluntly in her comment letter, “I would rather be in pain and suffer than pay the exorbitant interest charged to me.” This article was first published by the Lever, an award-winning independent investigative newsroom.

The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards.

Along with financial technology companies like PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, these payment apps offer digital wallets, usually connected to customers’ bank accounts, that store balances and transfer funds. These payment networks have transformed the financial services industry so quickly that Wall Street banks are running scared. Despite these products’ ostensible convenience for consumers, payment processing services come with a variety of financial risks. For starters, while payment networks’ transaction fees are far lower than the credit card companies’ swipe fees, as these payment networks become more ubiquitous and acquire market power, rates could increase. Apple Pay collects a standard commission of less than a percent on every transaction, which in aggregate amounts to a billion-dollar windfall for the company. Tech companies are also effectively managing their customers’ digital balances without the protections of traditional financial institutions. When money sits in a bank account, it’s usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that reimburses depositors’ money if it disappears during an event like a bank run. But funds sitting in a Venmo account or a stored-value account in Apple Wallet are not insured. Financial regulators estimate that these payment apps are holding billions of dollars of completely uninsured deposits. If the apps suffered a technical glitch, got hacked, or unexpectedly went bankrupt, customers could lose their money. This happened in 2024 when Synapse, a technology company connecting fintech apps like Juno and Yotta with banks, suddenly collapsed, putting nearly one hundred thousand customers at risk of losing their life savings. Thousands did. Amanda Fischer, a financial policy expert at the research organization Better Markets, notes that there’s also a taxpayer risk if these payment processing services collapse. With their current growth rate, tech giants’ banking footprints could become “too big to fail,” potentially requiring a taxpayer bailout to avoid a nationwide economic collapse. “Imagine the millions of people that use Amazon are now maintaining balances on their account, and something goes wrong with Amazon corporate,” said Fischer, who served as the chief of staff and senior counselor to the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “It’s a really good way to take the U.S. government hostage.” There’s another concern: A driving factor behind Big Tech’s payments networks — as with all embedded finance — is the new opportunities it provides for consumer surveillance. “Payments have gone from this really sleepy blackwater to the cutting-edge forefront of consumer issues, and a lot of that is due to the monetization of financial data,” said Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau general counsel. Frotman added that users’ financial information is one of the last remaining frontiers for data privacy. That’s because sensitive financial data, unlike online shopping patterns or location tracking, has typically been well protected at tightly regulated banking institutions. By running payment networks, Google, Meta, and Amazon have a God’s-eye view into financial transactions that take place not just on their own platforms but across others when users pay with their digital wallets. In a 2023 speech, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said that the tech firms “have a strong incentive to surveil all aspects of a consumer’s transactions, since this data can advantage the rest of their businesses.” By identifying users’ purchasing habits, tech companies could exploit those tendencies to sell people more goods or keep them on the platform. What’s more, by controlling banking services, tech companies can also cut users out of the financial system for any reason, in a process called “debanking.” “Corporate surveillance activities can also raise a range of questions about espionage, tracking, and censorship,” said Chopra. Simultaneously, Silicon Valley’s entry into banking has also created a countervailing bankification effect: Threatened by Big Tech’s encroachment, Wall Street firms are now trying to edge into tech’s core business. JPMorgan, for example, launched an advertising brokerage last year to compete with Big Tech’s digital advertising empire. It’s more likely than not that bankification is already hiding in plain sight in your wallet. While your credit cards used to be simply branded with big bank names like Chase, Capital One, and American Express, now they’re often linked to specific corporate brands, like Costco, Disney, Netflix, and even NASCAR. More and more businesses, especially in retail, are offering credit cards to encourage consumer spending on their brands. More than half of the country’s top one hundred retailers, for example, now offer their own business-specific credit cards, including Target, Macy’s, and Nordstrom. The resulting revenues, split between businesses and the partnered credit card companies, are highly lucrative. For the top segment of large retailers, payments on store-specific cards generate up to 14 percent of company profits, a critical income stream for businesses operating on relatively thin profit margins. If not for the hundreds of millions it makes from its widely used credit cards, the Kohl’s department store chain would be in the red. No sector is more dependent on its credit cards than the airline industry. Even though all of the country’s major airlines lost money on flying passengers last year, the companies still earned billions in operating profits — mostly from revenues they earned from unregulated frequent-flier programs they operate through branded credit cards. In 2023, Delta Air Lines, the world’s most lucrative airline, generated the bulk of its $4.6 billion in operating income from its deal with American Express, and so far this year, nearly all of its earnings have come from the credit card company. This arrangement led the legal scholar and airline expert Ganesh Sitharaman to conclude that “frequent-flier [points] systems… turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side.” While these frequent-flier programs promise rewards like discounted seats or free flights, experts say these perks are rarely good deals for consumers. As recent investigations and government probes have revealed, airlines have been known to put their thumbs on the scale to devalue and distort points when it helps their bottom line. That includes a 2024 Department of Transportation investigation that probed the airlines for systematically devaluing their point systems and raising reward thresholds to reduce the number of free flights and other perks offered to customers. “Airlines will [deviate] the point prices compared to the dollar price… in order to affect the overall value of the monetary supply of points,” said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator. “It’s almost as though they’re acting like their own central bankers.” For example, Delta in 2023 switched the metric for its SkyMiles points system from miles traveled to total customer spending, which dramatically devalued the points accrued by its customers. The changes were met with widespread outrage by budget-conscious travelers, since their flights would no longer generate as many points. One well-known blogger at the credit card–focused travel site The Points Guy declared that he would “stop chasing airline status.” Similarly, credit card reward programs in other industries rarely pay off for customers. “Consumers think they’re getting convenience, but businesses get new ways to monetize your data and make revenue [off] you,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The trade-off in the end balances out to favor companies in ways many consumers don’t realize in terms of the security and privacy of their money and data.” At a basic level, loyalty rewards work similarly to a punch card at a coffee shop. The difference is that credit card rewards programs use far more sophisticated financial tools and technology to create a vastly more intricate system that stacks the deck in favor of companies’ bottom lines. Take Starbucks and Dunkin’, which run two of the country’s largest retail rewards programs. Starbucks boasts over thirty million users, while Dunkin’ claims over ten million. Both programs reward customers with a free coffee if they preload a certain amount of money onto their digital rewards apps, to be used at the stores’ locations. The total balances held across these digital apps have exploded, in Starbucks’ case to nearly $2 billion, larger than the balances managed by many small- and medium-sized banks — except without any of the same regulatory oversight. A significant portion of the clientele who sign up for these programs forget about their balances and never spend them. Customers have essentially placed their money in a savings account that accrues no interest, while giving these conglomerates an interest-free loan to use at the company’s discretion. If Starbucks or Dunkin’ ever experienced financial difficulties or went out of business, these digital funds could evaporate. That might not be as implausible as it sounds, considering how Wall Street firms have acquired and stripped once-powerful retail empires like Toys “R” Us for parts. When the private equity-backed bowling alley chain Bowlero merged with bowling competitor Lucky Strike and rebranded in 2023, the balances that customers had stored on their Bowlero rewards card vanished overnight. Loyalty reward scams aren’t the only problem with retail credit cards. For one thing, the cost of such credit cards is usually higher than that of non-retail cards. In 2024, 90 percent of retail credit cards had annual percentage rates (APR) above 30 percent, compared to just a third of other cards. According to government regulators, retail credit cards are, in general, among the most expensive credit options, thanks to their excessive fees and interest charges. These high fees are so important to the credit card companies that a Biden administration rule to cap late fees at $8 threatened to significantly cut into industry profits. The Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, immediately sued the agency to block the rule. To take advantage of these high fees, retailers are forcing their workers to become credit card salesmen. “Companies are enlisting low-wage workers to target other low-wage earners with predatory products,” said Frotman. At employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, retail workers’ compensation is reportedly dependent in part on hitting sales quotas for signing customers up for store credit cards. Such requirements have become the source of contract disputes during union bargaining at some stores. With their salaries on the line, retail workers are often forced to hawk cards to customers without adequate training to evaluate creditworthiness. For this reason, regulators have warned that the underwriting standards for retail cards are less stringent, which may be driving customers into bad deals and debt. “Does anyone think this is going to end well?” asked Frotman. On average, retail cardholders are more likely than other credit card customers to carry a balance and only pay the minimum monthly amount due, which increases the likelihood of going into debt, according to government findings. In health care, the peddling of credit cards can be even more exploitative, contributing to the nation’s ballooning medical debt crisis. For the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or aren’t fully covered, doctors and nurses are now offering these cards or other installment loans to help them pay their medical bills. While these cards were historically offered just for elective procedures, they’re increasingly being promoted for basic health expenses and medical emergencies. CareCredit from Synchrony Financial, one of the largest financial players in the medical space, now carries 11.7 million cardholders and lists over 250,000 health care partners. While medical credit cards can reduce care providers’ billing and administration costs, regulators have found that the sale of these cards often comes with minimal disclosure of the unforgiving terms, high rates, and other predatory practices. In some instances, the cards have been sold to patients whose procedures, unbeknownst to them, might have been covered by their insurance or nonprofit hospitals’ bill-forgiveness programs. “We transcribed phone calls that we had with hospitals to kind of show how they’re softly nudging people toward these payment products,” said Eli Rushbanks, the general counsel at the patient advocacy nonprofit Dollar For, which submitted a public comment in 2023 calling for a government inquiry into the matter. “We took screenshots of websites that really blend the ideas of what’s Medicaid, what’s charity care, and what’s a payment plan under just sort of a nebulous umbrella of financial assistance.” The American Prospect even reported that regulators have learned of instances in which patients had no memory of agreeing to use a medical credit card. It turned out that they had been signed up for the service while they were under anesthesia. In their quest to embrace embedded finance, companies are venturing into new, unregulated areas of banking and lending. Rideshare apps Uber and Lyft have developed company-issued debit cards, payment processing apps, and even in-house auto lending programs that they offer to their drivers. These payment services aren’t covered by the FDIC, and the lending arms have been taken to court for illegal, exploitative practices such as charging higher interest rates than the industry average. All of these financial arrangements threaten to lock rideshare workers into their jobs, as their employer serves as their de facto banker. Amazon similarly began offering workers a product called “earned wage access,” which lends them their salary before payday, putting them in debt to their boss. The earned-wage-access industry has been criticized for exploiting low-income workers by charging steep penalties for late payments. Most prominently, big-box retailers and grocery stores are increasingly offering “buy now, pay later” options at checkout, providing consumers short-term financing for purchases that they often can’t afford. Buy now, pay later is a short-term financing option that provides smaller loans to be paid back in incremental installments. Sometimes promoted as zero-interest loans, buy now, pay later options often involve costly late fees and sneaky terms that can saddle borrowers with sky-high interest rates if they don’t pay off the loan on time. While buy now, pay later programs often charge merchants higher transaction fees than credit cards, nearly all major chain stores now offer the option because it helps generate more sales. A number of companies, including Costco, are now integrating buy now, pay later options from providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay directly into their websites and apps to capture a larger share of the resulting revenues. These deals encourage retailers to push a largely unregulated financial product. Over a quarter of all Americans now use buy now, pay later programs, and according to a recent survey from LendingTree, roughly 25 percent of those customers regularly use the option to pay for basic items like groceries. Even more concerning, 40 percent of buy now, pay later borrowers reported missing at least one of their installment payments, leading to late fees. “The marketing of buy now, pay later loans can make them appear to be a zero-risk credit option,” read a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report identifying “several areas of risk of consumer harm.” The report concluded that borrowers with buy now, pay later plans were more likely “to be highly indebted,” to “have delinquencies in traditional credit products,” and to exhibit “high levels of financial distress.” The agency’s assessment also noted that buy now, pay later lenders may be engaging in a form of “regulatory arbitrage” by strategically operating in the shadows and avoiding stricter legal standards imposed on other financial markets. Along with preying on consumers, embedded finance also targets small, independent businesses. Fintech companies such as Shopify, PayPal, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square offer business-management services for nascent enterprises, including transaction processing, one of the biggest logjams in digital retail. But these benefits come with a catch: The platforms steer small businesses toward merchant cash advances, a virtually unregulated financial service that’s been accused of exploitative practices. Merchant cash advances provide businesses with lines of credit, but instead of expecting direct reimbursement, lenders take a fixed percentage of the businesses’ sales until the end of the loan term. By arguing that their product is not a loan covered by financial regulations but rather an investment in their borrowers’ business, merchant cash advance providers are free to saddle businesses with exorbitantly high payments and avoid state caps on excessive interest charges. America’s long-standing efforts to separate banking and commerce haven’t kept up with the breakneck growth of nonbank financial institutions. While these businesses engage in many of the same kinds of lending as banks, they don’t accept traditional commercial deposits. That means they’re not subject to the same regulatory oversight from banking authorities tasked with protecting consumers from financial risk. The digital app Juno, for example, advertised itself as a “complete replacement for banking” with better savings rates — except without consumer protections like FDIC insurance. So when Synapse, a software company that Juno relied on for back-end tech services, collapsed in 2024, many Juno customers lost their entire savings. During the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies pursued a range of actions and investigations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the burgeoning embedded-finance market. Government investigators probed predatory practices in retail credit cards, medical debt loans, buy now, pay later services, and digital payment apps. Some of the probes led to new regulations, such as a 2024 rule that extended financial regulators’ supervisory authority to Big Tech payment platforms and regulated them as strictly as banks. That rule drew ire from the tech industry and was immediately terminated by the Trump administration, along with a host of other Biden-era financial reforms. Since then, one of the country’s top financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been systematically dismantled under the direction of the White House. The Trump administration has even indicated it will reopen applications for industrial loan companies, the auto industry–owned banks that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. The news inspired each of the country’s Big Four auto companies to file new applications to operate their own banks. The result is that consumers have been left to navigate the strange new world of bankification on their own — with troubling consequences. Take Paula, a Florida resident, who had to undergo an emergency dental procedure that cost thousands of dollars. Her insurer wouldn’t cover it, so her dental practice recommended she sign up for a CareCredit payment plan to afford the bill. According to a public comment letter submitted to consumer regulators by the advocacy group Consumer Reports on her behalf, Paula paid the requested amount each month — but when the plan’s zero-interest promotional period expired, she still had a remaining balance of $700, so interest payments kicked in. The following month, Paula’s bill doubled to $1,400. It turned out that thanks to Care Credit’s unregulated fine print, the company charged interest on the total up-front cost of her medical bill, rather than her remaining balance. For Paula, the frictionless convenience offered by embedded finance wasn’t a panacea — it was a debt trap. As she put it bluntly in her comment letter, “I would rather be in pain and suffer than pay the exorbitant interest charged to me.” This article was first published by the Lever, an award-winning independent investigative newsroom.

Most major corporations — from airlines to social media platforms — now aspire to become unregulated banks. Bankification today accounts for the highest profit margins in the US economy, crippling productive capacity and setting the stage for the next crash. Airlines lose money on flights and make windfall profits off credit cards and frequent-flyer programs that are bad for consumers. But the phenomenon isn’t limited to flying banks like Delta — almost every major US corporation now aspires to be a bank.

The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns about the effect of mixing nonbanks into the financial system. “It’s the recipe for a subprime crisis 2.0. Why would we want to see that play out again?” The quest to combine banking and commerce has been one of the holy grails of robber barons for centuries. In the nineteentth century, industry tycoons like John Pierpont Morgan and Jay Gould used their banking fortunes to finance the expansion of their own railroad projects. In the twentieth century, banking empires such as A.P. Giannini’s TransAmerica (now Bank of America) controlled manufacturing ventures from oil and gas to home construction and even frozen foods before Congress forced the conglomerates to divest from commercial enterprises. Bankification usually follows the same pattern: Once businesses dominate their market, monopolizing the heavy-industry sectors isn’t enough. Companies instead set their sights on acquiring the lifeblood of commerce: banking, where they can make money off of money by lending capital to be repaid with interest and collecting fees on financial transactions. Instead of haggling with risk-averse bankers or courting new investors for financing, corporations could set up their own financial institutions to receive customer deposits, tap these pools of capital to fund their own projects at better rates, and cut off banking access to competitors that encroach on their market share or unions that meddle with the business. Ever greater financialization, however, has crippled the American economy. After a wave of financial deregulation in the 1980s, Wall Street looked to expand beyond the bounds of traditional finance. In the corporate raider era, private equity firms and hedge funds began acquiring ever more Fortune 500 companies through buyouts and stock market ownership. The pressure to deliver shareholder returns pushed companies to outsource manufacturing jobs overseas, leaving the United States with an economy dominated by high finance and software technology. Despite industry titans’ plans for total control of the financial economy, lawmakers have long recognized that cross-ownership of banking and commerce would concentrate too much financial risk. “We treat banks as systemically important to our society, so we subsidize them as a public good through things like FDIC insurance, because if they go out of business, that’s a problem in a way that Macy’s going out of business isn’t,” explained Brad Lipton, the director of the corporate power and financial regulation program at the Roosevelt Institute and a former senior consumer financial protection regulator during the Biden administration. “You don’t want to mix the two.” Regulators first established a firm legal separation between the sectors with the National Banking Act of 1864, which codified rules for national banking charters. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shored up those rules, taking aim at the banking subsidiaries that conglomerates were using to circumvent regulations. But corporate America has continuously found ways to circumvent these legal prohibitions. The last major fight to ensure a clear separation between banking and commerce took place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lead-up to the disaster, which would result in over five million foreclosures and roughly ten million job losses, giant commercial firms like General Motors and General Electric used a decades-old legal loophole to operate “industrial loan companies.” These largely unregulated financial arms made poor lending decisions, such as acquiring growing portfolios of risky subprime mortgages. The mass defaults of these mortgages ultimately contributed to their owners’ bankruptcies, requiring federal bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, tried to put an end to these industrial banks by issuing a federal moratorium on new bank charters, among other banking reforms. But since then, a bold new wave of bankification has taken shape, further diverting companies’ resources from production to financial extraction. In 2020, a general partner at the venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz delivered a speech titled “Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company.” The presentation outlined the vision behind a nascent industry called “embedded finance,” urging companies of all kinds to integrate financial services into their operations or lose out on future growth. “Embedded finance” now appears in startup pitch decks and conference panels nearly as regularly as terms like AI and crypto, acting like a Pavlovian bell to get the attention of financiers for seed capital. “The business world realized that adding a financial services element to nearly every product is a way to supercharge their attractiveness to Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” said Seth Frotman, former general counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. Along with other major investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz now holds substantial stakes in these ventures. The venture capital fund has estimated that adding financial services, from selling insurance product warranties on goods to speeding up the online checkout process by leveraging data collection, can boost companies’ revenues by two to five times per customer and generate $230 billion in added revenue by the end of this year. Big Tech’s main focus so far has been payment processing services, for which they can charge fees on each transaction. Apple Pay, the largest of these networks, already boasts nearly 750 million active users worldwide and facilitates transactions worth trillions of dollars. Google, Meta, Amazon, and now even OpenAI also operate their own payment networks, which act as middlemen to facilitate contactless transactions and manage customers’ money. Along with financial technology companies like PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, these payment apps offer digital wallets, usually connected to customers’ bank accounts, that store balances and transfer funds. These payment networks have transformed the financial services industry so quickly that Wall Street banks are running scared. Despite these products’ ostensible convenience for consumers, payment processing services come with a variety of financial risks. For starters, while payment networks’ transaction fees are far lower than the credit card companies’ swipe fees, as these payment networks become more ubiquitous and acquire market power, rates could increase. Apple Pay collects a standard commission of less than a percent on every transaction, which in aggregate amounts to a billion-dollar windfall for the company. Tech companies are also effectively managing their customers’ digital balances without the protections of traditional financial institutions. When money sits in a bank account, it’s usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that reimburses depositors’ money if it disappears during an event like a bank run. But funds sitting in a Venmo account or a stored-value account in Apple Wallet are not insured. Financial regulators estimate that these payment apps are holding billions of dollars of completely uninsured deposits. If the apps suffered a technical glitch, got hacked, or unexpectedly went bankrupt, customers could lose their money. This happened in 2024 when Synapse, a technology company connecting fintech apps like Juno and Yotta with banks, suddenly collapsed, putting nearly one hundred thousand customers at risk of losing their life savings.

With their current growth rate, tech giants’ banking footprints could become “too big to fail,” potentially requiring a taxpayer bailout to avoid a nationwide economic collapse. “Imagine the millions of people that use Amazon are now maintaining balances on their account, and something goes wrong with Amazon corporate,” said Fischer, who served as the chief of staff and senior counselor to the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “It’s a really good way to take the U.S. government hostage.” There’s another concern: A driving factor behind Big Tech’s payments networks — as with all embedded finance — is the new opportunities it provides for consumer surveillance. “Payments have gone from this really sleepy blackwater to the cutting-edge forefront of consumer issues, and a lot of that is due to the monetization of financial data,” said Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau general counsel.

That’s because sensitive financial data, unlike online shopping patterns or location tracking, has typically been well protected at tightly regulated banking institutions.

One well-known blogger at the credit card–focused travel site The Points Guy declared that he would “stop chasing airline status.” Similarly, credit card reward programs in other industries rarely pay off for customers. “Consumers think they’re getting convenience, but businesses get new ways to monetize your data and make revenue [off] you,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The trade-off in the end balances out to favor companies in ways many consumers don’t realize in terms of the security and privacy of their money and data.” At a basic level, loyalty rewards work similarly to a punch card at a coffee shop. The difference is that credit card rewards programs use far more sophisticated financial tools and technology to create a vastly more intricate system that stacks the deck in favor of companies’ bottom lines. Take Starbucks and Dunkin’, which run two of the country’s largest retail rewards programs. Starbucks boasts over thirty million users, while Dunkin’ claims over ten million. Both programs reward customers with a free coffee if they preload a certain amount of money onto their digital rewards apps, to be used at the stores’ locations. The total balances held across these digital apps have exploded, in Starbucks’ case to nearly $2 billion, larger than the balances managed by many small- and medium-sized banks — except without any of the same regulatory oversight. A significant portion of the clientele who sign up for these programs forget about their balances and never spend them. Customers have essentially placed their money in a savings account that accrues no interest, while giving these conglomerates an interest-free loan to use at the company’s discretion. If Starbucks or Dunkin’ ever experienced financial difficulties or went out of business, these digital funds could evaporate. That might not be as implausible as it sounds, considering how Wall Street firms have acquired and stripped once-powerful retail empires like Toys “R” Us for parts. When the private equity-backed bowling alley chain Bowlero merged with bowling competitor Lucky Strike and rebranded in 2023, the balances that customers had stored on their Bowlero rewards card vanished overnight. Loyalty reward scams aren’t the only problem with retail credit cards. For one thing, the cost of such credit cards is usually higher than that of non-retail cards. In 2024, 90 percent of retail credit cards had annual percentage rates (APR) above 30 percent, compared to just a third of other cards. According to government regulators, retail credit cards are, in general, among the most expensive credit options, thanks to their excessive fees and interest charges. These high fees are so important to the credit card companies that a Biden administration rule to cap late fees at $8 threatened to significantly cut into industry profits. The Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, immediately sued the agency to block the rule. To take advantage of these high fees, retailers are forcing their workers to become credit card salesmen. “Companies are enlisting low-wage workers to target other low-wage earners with predatory products,” said Frotman. At employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, retail workers’ compensation is reportedly dependent in part on hitting sales quotas for signing customers up for store credit cards. Such requirements have become the source of contract disputes during union bargaining at some stores. With their salaries on the line, retail workers are often forced to hawk cards to customers without adequate training to evaluate creditworthiness. For this reason, regulators have warned that the underwriting standards for retail cards are less stringent, which may be driving customers into bad deals and debt. “Does anyone think this is going to end well?” asked Frotman. On average, retail cardholders are more likely than other credit card customers to carry a balance and only pay the minimum monthly amount due, which increases the likelihood of going into debt, according to government findings. In health care, the peddling of credit cards can be even more exploitative, contributing to the nation’s ballooning medical debt crisis. For the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or aren’t fully covered, doctors and nurses are now offering these cards or other installment loans to help them pay their medical bills. While these cards were historically offered just for elective procedures, they’re increasingly being promoted for basic health expenses and medical emergencies. CareCredit from Synchrony Financial, one of the largest financial players in the medical space, now carries 11.7 million cardholders and lists over 250,000 health care partners. While medical credit cards can reduce care providers’ billing and administration costs, regulators have found that the sale of these cards often comes with minimal disclosure of the unforgiving terms, high rates, and other predatory practices. In some instances, the cards have been sold to patients whose procedures, unbeknownst to them, might have been covered by their insurance or nonprofit hospitals’ bill-forgiveness programs. “We transcribed phone calls that we had with hospitals to kind of show how they’re softly nudging people toward these payment products,” said Eli Rushbanks, the general counsel at the patient advocacy nonprofit Dollar For, which submitted a public comment in 2023 calling for a government inquiry into the matter. “We took screenshots of websites that really blend the ideas of what’s Medicaid, what’s charity care, and what’s a payment plan under just sort of a nebulous umbrella of financial assistance.” The American Prospect even reported that regulators have learned of instances in which patients had no memory of agreeing to use a medical credit card. It turned out that they had been signed up for the service while they were under anesthesia. In their quest to embrace embedded finance, companies are venturing into new, unregulated areas of banking and lending. Rideshare apps Uber and Lyft have developed company-issued debit cards, payment processing apps, and even in-house auto lending programs that they offer to their drivers. These payment services aren’t covered by the FDIC, and the lending arms have been taken to court for illegal, exploitative practices such as charging higher interest rates than the industry average. All of these financial arrangements threaten to lock rideshare workers into their jobs, as their employer serves as their de facto banker. Amazon similarly began offering workers a product called “earned wage access,” which lends them their salary before payday, putting them in debt to their boss. The earned-wage-access industry has been criticized for exploiting low-income workers by charging steep penalties for late payments. Most prominently, big-box retailers and grocery stores are increasingly offering “buy now, pay later” options at checkout, providing consumers short-term financing for purchases that they often can’t afford. Buy now, pay later is a short-term financing option that provides smaller loans to be paid back in incremental installments. Sometimes promoted as zero-interest loans, buy now, pay later options often involve costly late fees and sneaky terms that can saddle borrowers with sky-high interest rates if they don’t pay off the loan on time. While buy now, pay later programs often charge merchants higher transaction fees than credit cards, nearly all major chain stores now offer the option because it helps generate more sales. A number of companies, including Costco, are now integrating buy now, pay later options from providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay directly into their websites and apps to capture a larger share of the resulting revenues. These deals encourage retailers to push a largely unregulated financial product. Over a quarter of all Americans now use buy now, pay later programs, and according to a recent survey from LendingTree, roughly 25 percent of those customers regularly use the option to pay for basic items like groceries. Even more concerning, 40 percent of buy now, pay later borrowers reported missing at least one of their installment payments, leading to late fees. “The marketing of buy now, pay later loans can make them appear to be a zero-risk credit option,” read a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report identifying “several areas of risk of consumer harm.” The report concluded that borrowers with buy now, pay later plans were more likely “to be highly indebted,” to “have delinquencies in traditional credit products,” and to exhibit “high levels of financial distress.” The agency’s assessment also noted that buy now, pay later lenders may be engaging in a form of “regulatory arbitrage” by strategically operating in the shadows and avoiding stricter legal standards imposed on other financial markets. Along with preying on consumers, embedded finance also targets small, independent businesses. Fintech companies such as Shopify, PayPal, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square offer business-management services for nascent enterprises, including transaction processing, one of the biggest logjams in digital retail. But these benefits come with a catch: The platforms steer small businesses toward merchant cash advances, a virtually unregulated financial service that’s been accused of exploitative practices. Merchant cash advances provide businesses with lines of credit, but instead of expecting direct reimbursement, lenders take a fixed percentage of the businesses’ sales until the end of the loan term. By arguing that their product is not a loan covered by financial regulations but rather an investment in their borrowers’ business, merchant cash advance providers are free to saddle businesses with exorbitantly high payments and avoid state caps on excessive interest charges. America’s long-standing efforts to separate banking and commerce haven’t kept up with the breakneck growth of nonbank financial institutions. While these businesses engage in many of the same kinds of lending as banks, they don’t accept traditional commercial deposits. That means they’re not subject to the same regulatory oversight from banking authorities tasked with protecting consumers from financial risk. The digital app Juno, for example, advertised itself as a “complete replacement for banking” with better savings rates — except without consumer protections like FDIC insurance. So when Synapse, a software company that Juno relied on for back-end tech services, collapsed in 2024, many Juno customers lost their entire savings. During the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies pursued a range of actions and investigations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the burgeoning embedded-finance market. Government investigators probed predatory practices in retail credit cards, medical debt loans, buy now, pay later services, and digital payment apps. Some of the probes led to new regulations, such as a 2024 rule that extended financial regulators’ supervisory authority to Big Tech payment platforms and regulated them as strictly as banks. That rule drew ire from the tech industry and was immediately terminated by the Trump administration, along with a host of other Biden-era financial reforms. Since then, one of the country’s top financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been systematically dismantled under the direction of the White House. The Trump administration has even indicated it will reopen applications for industrial loan companies, the auto industry–owned banks that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. The news inspired each of the country’s Big Four auto companies to file new applications to operate their own banks. The result is that consumers have been left to navigate the strange new world of bankification on their own — with troubling consequences. Take Paula, a Florida resident, who had to undergo an emergency dental procedure that cost thousands of dollars. Her insurer wouldn’t cover it, so her dental practice recommended she sign up for a CareCredit payment plan to afford the bill. According to a public comment letter submitted to consumer regulators by the advocacy group Consumer Reports on her behalf, Paula paid the requested amount each month — but when the plan’s zero-interest promotional period expired, she still had a remaining balance of $700, so interest payments kicked in. The following month, Paula’s bill doubled to $1,400. It turned out that thanks to Care Credit’s unregulated fine print, the company charged interest on the total up-front cost of her medical bill, rather than her remaining balance. For Paula, the frictionless convenience offered by embedded finance wasn’t a panacea — it was a debt trap. As she put it bluntly in her comment letter, “I would rather be in pain and suffer than pay the exorbitant interest charged to me.” This article was first published by the Lever, an award-winning independent investigative newsroom.

Title: Review: Prodigy V2 – looks rad, goes far, hurts bum
URL: https://newatlas.com/bicycles/ride1up-prodigy-v2-review/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T00:50:16Z
Full Content:
The Ride1Up doesn't just look good – it looks sweet. The matte black frame and gum-wall tires hit me right in the kid-feels. It just needs an old milk crate zip-tied to the cargo rack and it'd look perfect. To start, it wasn't just me testing the ebike. "Wifey," as I call her, has much more experience riding ebikes than I do (and is more opinionated than I am? Am I allowed to say that?), and I have a friend who rides almost daily on her uber-expensive, carbon fiber setup but has somehow never ridden an ebike before. I've smooshed our combined thoughts together into this review. The Prodigy V2 has some solid tech in it for a US$2,000 (normally $2,495) machine, starting with the heart of it: a 36-volt Brose mid-drive motor. The German automotive supplier company has been around for a while and is well known for its reliable, smooth, quiet, and powerful mid-drive motors. The Prodigy V2 does not disappoint in that department, cranking out 66 lb-ft (89 Nm) of pedal-assist fury – but quiet enough that you can barely hear it while you hamster away at the pedals. Though, there is a slight "quirk" when shifting gears that takes a little bit of getting used to ... The Prodigy V2 uses a shift sensor that briefly cuts power to the motor when you change gears on the 9-speed Shimano cassette to alleviate wear and tear on the drivetrain. How/why? Well, the motor pumps out about 380% more torque than what you're likely capable of – it's like strapping a pro-level sprinter to your pedals with no off switch. That kind of hard-hitting toque just wants to break chains and shear cogs, so taking the load off while shifting keeps that from happening. It's a bit annoying when you're pedaling uphill and need to downshift, but better than snapping chains, for sure. There's always a price to pay for big torque numbers like that, I suppose. Another feature that's pretty nifty for a relatively inexpensive ebike is air-charged fork suspension. Not something normally seen at this lower price point. It can be tuned to match your weight and riding style simply by increasing or decreasing the air pressure. It has a suspension lockout too, if that's what you're into. With minor adjustments, we found that it soaks up bumps adequately up front with its 100-mm of travel, but the bike is still a hard-tail, so don't expect a plush ride if you're on cobblestone streets or anywhere in Louisiana, really. The V2 comes equipped with 27.5-inch wheels shod in Maxxis Rekon Race, 2.25-inch wide, gum-wall rubber (I love gum-walls, did I mention that?). Not quite a full mountain-bike-type setup, but fantastic for grip on and off road. "Better than expected," was the consensus when talking about grip levels on gravel and compact sand. The four-piston Tektro Orion 4P hydraulic brakes on 180-mm rotors will get you stopped in a hurry. Both front and rear brakes have great feel on the levers, too. No cable-pull brakes for this ride. While the Tektro might not be a particularly high-end brake setup, it still performs wonderfully, and replacement pads can be found for around 20 bucks. The bike is offered in both chain and belt-drive setups, with the belt paired to an Enviolo CVT hub for seamless ratio changes. We tested out the old school chain-drive on the XR frame version, so I haven't a clue what the belt drive is like, though I'm pretty curious. There's also an ST frame with a lower top tube for easier step-through on both the chain and CVT variants. The saddle and seating position were the areas of the bike we unanimously agreed could be better. The pedals sit pretty much under you, which is fine for short cruises, but could be set further forward for better ergonomics. And while the stock Selle Royal Viento saddle looks good, it won't win any comfort awards. It's just good enough on shorter spins, but the wifey says it's flat-out terrible – too hard, too narrow, too uncomfortable. My cyclist-friend wasn't impressed either, mostly with the lack of enough adjustability. Perhaps more adjustability on the seat to move it further back would fix all those issues. Realistically, swapping out for your preferred saddle is something most people are going to do anyway, so this isn't really a deal-breaker. A quick look at the numbers: Range and modes: I think Ride1Up may have been a bit conservative with its range estimates. The bike has over 60 miles (97 km) on the ODO now, and based on start/finish battery levels while testing it out, it seems like the bike will easily hit more than the claimed 30-50 mile (48–80 km) range on a single charge ... at least out here in the flatlands, and depending on your strength, weight and level of assist, of course. Maybe more like 40-70 miles (64–113 km) of range in our tests. Tour is the sweet spot for cruising while still feeling like you're getting your heart rate up. Sport adds some punch, and Boost is where the bike really takes off and makes you feel heroic. Boost makes the 58-lb (26.8-kg) beast feel light – perfect for hammering a headwind, sit-n-spinnin' some hills, or pulling away from a stop sign with traffic on your tail, honking at you. We saw a top speed of 29.5 mph (47.5 km/h). Eco has its place, if only to simply offset the bike's heft while getting you to your far away destination. Handling is quick but stable at all speeds. Wifey was confident enough to ride hands-off without it feeling sketchy – something she doesn't generally do. The bike has an integrated taillight that stays brightly lit at all times – and honestly looks really good – but does not indicate when you're braking. The 80-lux (~300-lumen) headlight is adequate – a bit too spotlight-ish and not a far enough throw, but it gets the job done if you're out and about in the dark. If you're a frequent night rider like I am, just chuck a Knog Blinder on it (which is what I did) and you're pretty much set. The only consistent gripe about the whole bike, outside of a sore bum, was the on/off switch on the little 1.5-inch display – it's a bit awkward and small and lacks enough texture to easily feel with a bare hand, let alone with a gloved hand. You just have to know exactly where it is, as it's not visible from the cockpit, to long-press it. How long? We're not sure, as it seemed pretty inconsistent in the duration it took to turn it on. Otherwise, the screen has all the information you could ever want or need, from state of charge to speed, cadence and more. It also has Bluetooth, though there's no companion app for the Prodigy V2 … maybe it's a future project? I'd very much like to have stats on my phone or maybe a Bluetooth lockout feature like my scooter has. Charging isn't the quickest either. The 2-amp charger is going to take you about 7-8 hours to top off the battery from dead. So if you've got a proper commute that's going to kill your battery, you'd better get it charging ASAP if you want a full battery for the ride back ... and as the ebike is a bit of a tank without power, it's not something you'll prefer to pedal unassisted for long. But that's kind of the point of an ebike, right? Something that takes the load off for you. It's not perfect, but it nails all the essentials: a reliable, quiet mid-drive motor, legit brakes front and rear, beefy wheels and tires, and a fairly relaxed and comfortable riding position. That seat though ... My cyclist friend says she rides for cardio, so she's not planning on switching to electric any time soon. But she did say, "when friends or family come out, no one wants to ride with me ... but having this bike means they might want to and they can keep up. That alone makes it worth a spot in the garage." If I could change one thing about the bike, I'd slap a throttle on it. After all, who doesn't want a cheater button now and again and just let the motor do all the work for you? But then it wouldn't be a Class-3 bike anymore, would it? Ride1Up has a range of bikes from cafe and beach cruisers, carbon fiber racers, Class-2 Monkey-style bikes to retro offroad dirtbikes and everything in between. Or as Tom Segura would say, "...BIKES!" Source: Ride1Up Prodigy V2 New Atlas may receive a commission from purchases made via our links; this does not influence our review.

October 07, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Oct. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has signed another multi-launch deal with Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS) – making Rocket Lab the primary launch provider to deploy the company’s commercial Earth-imaging constellation. The multi-launch contract includes three dedicated Electron missions that will launch no earlier than 2026 from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. With four dedicated missions already booked by iQPS on Electron, these three additional missions bring the total number of upcoming launches for iQPS to seven. Each dedicated launch will deploy a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite from a Rocket Lab Motorized Lightband separation system – demonstrating Rocket Lab’s vertical integration across launch and space systems that improves reliability and streamlines the launch process for its customers. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “We’re proud to be expanding our partnership with iQPS to deliver their QPS-SAR satellites to orbit. By choosing both Electron and our separation systems to deploy their satellites, iQPS takes advantage of a highly-integrated launch service that maximizes reliability and streamlines operations for faster access to space to grow their constellation. It’s a privilege to continue to deliver this for iQPS across our missions to date and the ones to come.” iQPS CEO, Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, says: “In 2025, we successfully deployed four satellites, QPS-SAR-9 through QPS-SAR-12, into their planned orbits aboard Electron. This outcome was exactly as we had anticipated, and it further reaffirmed our confidence in the rocket’s reliability. We are very pleased to have now signed an additional contract for the launch of three more satellites on Electron. This agreement marks an important step toward the realization of our QPS-SAR constellation. We will continue to make steady progress with unwavering dedication to achieving this goal.” As international orders for Electron’s responsive launch service continue to grow, Rocket Lab has increased its production and launch cadence to meet the demand for 20+ launches in 2025. Rocket Lab has successfully launched four missions for iQPS to date this year, including two missions launched back-to-back in less than four weeks between May and June. Rocket Lab’s next launch for iQPS is scheduled to take place from November. Further information about the launch will be announced in the coming days.

Title: Dizzying deal delirium: How the AI bubble bursts

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, while Nvidia is investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also counts Microsoft as one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoft accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su has defended AMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expects there to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.” Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos called the current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned that “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reports estimate that AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalest notes that “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanova points out that after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreaking report from Apple suggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” A recent study from MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations considered had achieved zero return on investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently after telling Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy at McKinsey & Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbook reported that nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23% in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such as Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator, on AI startups and the mindboggling valuations of those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI is committed to investing $300 billion in computing power with Oracle over the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation has almost doubled from $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recent reporting by CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Another report says the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk have each raised concerns about the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model, provided a recent example of what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is not difficult to imagine a major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerful Washington Post op-ed, Bethany McLean poignantly recalls the overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania AI automation could sharply increase productivity by the early 2030s, according to a Penn Wharton Budget Model brief, which estimated the likely impact on 784 occupations. Kent Smetters Shankar Parameshwaran Fears over job losses in an AI-led economy have become more real and clearer than ever in recent months. Major companies including Walmart, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Ford and Lufthansa have announced layoffs or reconfigured roles, and plans for new hires in areas like robotics won’t offset those. A new brief by the Penn Wharton Budget Model brings into sharp relief both the macro outlook on productivity, and the potential micro-level impact of AI automation. Alex Arnon, PWBM’s director of policy analysis, produced the brief with research assistance from data analyst Vidisha Chowdhury. PWBM faculty director Kent Smetters directed the study; he is also Wharton professor of business economics and public policy. According to the brief, titled “The Projected Impact of Generative AI on Future Productivity Growth,” AI will increase productivity and GDP by 1.5% by 2035, nearly 3% by 2055, and 3.7% by 2075. AI’s strongest boost to productivity growth will occur in the early 2030s (0.2 percentage points in 2032), but it will eventually fade to leave a permanent growth effect of 0.04 percentage points annually as the economy adjusts to AI. “In about 40% of the employment in [the occupations we looked at], at least 50% of the tasks will be replaceable in the future,” Smetters said in a recent episode of Wharton’s This Week in Business podcast. (Listen to the episode.) “It’s not a small impact by any measure. This does not mean that these jobs are replaceable; it could mean that these jobs become more productive. More time and data are required to understand the full impact.” While noting that it is premature to project the impact of AI on the federal budget, the brief estimated that it could reduce federal deficits by $400 billion over the 10-year budget window between 2026 and 2035. The findings in the brief are based on a study of the automation potential in 784 occupations to gauge the implications for productivity growth. It builds on a task-based framework developed by MIT professor and Nobel economics laureate Daron Acemoglu, with a projected timeline for gen AI adoption based on the adoption path of comparable technologies such as the commercial web and cloud computing services. “This does not mean that these jobs are replaceable; it could mean that these jobs become more productive.”—Kent Smetters The brief analyzed the impact of the potential exposure to AI automation across both income groups and specific occupations. Among its key findings: The PWBM brief predicted that the adoption timeline for AI’s productivity-enhancing tools will be similar to those of other mass-market technologies such as the PC, the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing. With most of those earlier technologies, adoption rose sharply in the first decade, with 40-50% of workers using them, but it slowed sharply in the next decade. The use of gen AI in 2024 suggested a faster adoption rate than previous technologies. Smetters cited PWBM’s Arnon, who supervised the PWBM brief, as noting that AI’s impact across occupations will be similar to how email changed how people communicate. “But it’s not a magic bullet either. It’s not electricity, it’s not refrigeration — it’s not that transformative.” “AI is not a magic bullet. It’s not electricity, it’s not refrigeration — it’s not that transformative.”— Kent Smetters The study’s projections are already beginning to show up in employment patterns. Job growth has stagnated in occupations with the most AI automation potential. Jobs that AI can completely replace saw a sharp fall in employment between 2021 and 2024 (0.75%), although these account for just about 1% of the total employment. Employment growth has slowed significantly for other occupations with high exposure to AI automation, where the technology can automate 90-99% of the tasks. In the future, gen AI tools will be used in more and more tasks exposed to AI productivity gains, alongside advancements in the technology and cost savings for employers, the brief stated. The share of economic activity exposed to AI will also grow faster than the rest of the economy, it added. Smetters cautioned against expecting AI to fix everything for the economy. “There’s this belief among policymakers that in this new era of AI, we don’t have to be fiscally responsible because AI is going to solve everything,” he said. “That’s simply not true. We’re not even close.” “AI is having a very big and salient impact [on stock values],” Smetters said. Barring the Magnificent Seven stocks (Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), which are the biggest AI adopters, earnings expectations haven’t changed much for 493 of the S&P 500 stocks, he added, citing a note by Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Companies may prepare for AI with varying degrees of optimism or skepticism, but they don’t have the option of ignoring it. “When you have really unusual transformative technology like [AI], you have two macro choices: You’re going to either lean into it, embrace it, and figure out how to make your customer experience better and shape it, or you can wish it away and have it happen to you,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a recent CNBC interview.

Title: Marketers Are Building Millions Of AI Agents. What Does That Mean For The Rest Of Us?

ByJohn Koetsier, Senior Contributor. Marketing and AI are getting married, and it’s a shotgun wedding. Marketing technology firms and the big AI platforms are furiously launching new capabilities that they say will help brands know us, feel our pain, understand our frustrations, intuit our desires and always send the right message at the right time to give us exactly what we want. But is that true? Or will consumers feel outgunned and manipulated by brands with seemingly god-like powers of knowing too much? At its Forge conference in Las Vegas last week, customer engagement platform Braze unveiled a sweeping set of AI and platform innovations designed to transform how brands interact with their customers. The centerpiece: AI agents: autonomous systems that can analyze terabytes of data, optimize campaigns, and craft content on behalf of marketers. Everyone’s making agents. OpenAI recently released agentic capabilities inside ChatGPT, and yesterday announced an agent builder at its DevDay event. Competitor Anthropic, which makes the Claude LLM, announced its Agent SDK yesterday too, as did the AI voice startup Eleven Labs. AI agent use in customer service grew 22X this year alone, according to Salesforce, which is also building and shipping agents. Marketing software HubSpot just launched 15 agents. Adobe, which offers a marketing cloud with dozens of software tools for marketers, launched even more agents, and these are just a few of the companies launching AI agents. Braze’s focus, like Agent Smith multiplying hundreds of times in the second Matrix movie, is giving every marketer super-powers via their own teams of intelligent, autonomous agents. Think winback agents (AI agents to get you back after you left. Cart abandonment agents (AI agents to coax you to buy that thing that you decided not to. Next purchase agents (AI agents to study your past behavior and intuit what you might buy next). And, of course, customer service agents and support agents and just about any kind of AI agent a brand can dream up for writing emails, sending push notifications, shooting you a quick chatty SMS or WhatsApp, and more. We used to say “there’s an app for that” to reference the impression that there’s apps for literally everything imaginable. Now, apparently, we’re approaching a future in which “there’s an agent for that.” So we’re rushing towards a world in which most of brand communication to customers will be not just automated--which it has been for years--but tailored, customized, and even personalized by smart AI agents to help you get what you want. Or, perhaps, to make you buy more. What’s that world going to look like? Braze CMO Astha Malik says it’s going to make brands smarter about what they send you. That it might result in fewer messages and less spam. “I want different things from different companies,” she told me. “That’s because I’m complicated.” In other words: the out-of-stock beauty product she wanted but couldn’t get: yes, she wants an immediate notification via SMS or a push notification. The home furnishings she was just browsing? Nope, don’t even think about sending a real-time message. Maybe email instead. On the face of it, that’s great for everyone. Consumers get what they want, brands get more sales, and everyone’s happy. Of course, the cost is giving brands that you like and buy from your personal information. Contact information, preferences information, and--of course--all the data that you using their websites and apps reveals about who you are and what you like. Not everyone at the conference was certain they liked the trade, including Dweeti Fanshawe, a marketer at EasyJet: “Because of the nature of where we work, I analyze how they know this,” she told me. “Should I be giving them less data?” Others were totally fine with the exchange. Mallory Gordon from Pacify Health told me that she wants brands that she likes and trusts to brands to know, understand, and anticipate her needs. That she has a strong preference for timing-specific, relevant communications, and that she pays attention to companies who show genuine customer understanding. “I connect with that so much more than just a generalized message of, oh, here’s 20% off of at the store … or a product you didn’t even want,” she told me. “And I think that’s true for a lot of people." For Braze product leader Kevin Wang, the key is brands implementing hard-core guardrails and exercising caution in using these newfound powers. Each message has a cost, and getting it wrong will feel like an invasion of privacy. “It is corrosive to your brand to not be relevant," Wang says. “I’ve gotten a bunch of really poorly timed push notifications. It just makes me think they’re dumb. And it’s like, I don’t want to work with dumb people." So: with great power comes great responsibility. That’s true from a number of different angles, of course. Marketing has always been about persuasion, and marketers have always had a lot of emotional tricks up their sleeve like scarcity ("only three left") or appeal to authority (95% of doctors agree") or social proof ("millions sold") and the like. The question is will AI supercharge this ability to persuade, and could this result in consumer harm? It’s at least worth thinking about. Duke University’s Ali Makhdoumi says, for example, that companies have a growing information advantage over consumers and that “constant improvements of large language models and machine learning capabilities will likely offer even more opportunities for behavioral manipulation.” That’s mostly in reference to large online platforms, but brands are increasingly capturing and storing more data as well. The good news is that you’re in control. Don’t like messages from a company? Turn it off in the app preferences, or--last resort--block the company. I’ve gotten some good push notifications from Uber, including discounts, but the company has yet to learn I only Uber when I travel … and so is sending me push notifications as I sit in my home office, making that off button very tempting indeed. The other good news is that in spite of every advance in AI and agents, it’s still too expensive for brands to simply apply AI agents to every customer. The compute costs would be far too high, Wang said. Marketing companies like Braze are fully aware of the potential problems, says co-founder and CTO Jon Hyman, which is why they’re applying AI to new features for message prioritization, ensuring brands send fewer but better notifications to their customers. There’s an ever better solution, however. Ultimately, we’ll each have our own agents, says Malik. “Their agents are going to be talking to your agents … the whole notion of like ‘my people can talk to your people’ is going to be ‘my agents are going to talk to your agents.’ And that is going to happen,” says the Braze CMO. We already see that somewhat in our email inboxes, where Gmail and Apple Mail apply prioritization rules that govern what we see, and what’s a little more hidden. They’re not yet using AI agents, but they are limiting distractions. Our own trusted and reliable AI agents will fully restore the balance of power. And ultimately, they could lead to the most efficient kind of market where indeed, you do get exactly what you want, and at--or close to--the price you want to pay, while brands do get a chance to get their messages and offers and communications in front of you. Or in front of your trusted personal AI agent.

Title: Dot-com fears rise with tech stocks seeing $100 billion swings

Investors are excited about OpenAI’s expansion driving big gains in technology stocks, but a rising number of Wall Street pros fear that the wild pops that add tens of billions of dollars in value in mere minutes are signaling an unhealthy market reminiscent of the dot-com era. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. took this rocket ride on Monday, as the company’s stock soared, briefly boosting its market capitalization by roughly $100 billion at an intraday high, after the chipmaker signed a deal with OpenAI that could lead to billions of dollars in revenue. AMD’s shares extended gains into a second day, rising as much as 7.5% in early trading on Tuesday. This follows a 36% jump in Oracle Corp. shares last month, which added $255 billion to the software firm’s market value in a single session, after it gave blockbuster guidance for its cloud business, including an agreement with the ChatGPT operator worth $300 billion over five years. “If any one of these deals falls through it has this domino effect downstream that I think is concerning,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., which has about $12 billion in assets. “It reminds me of what happened with telecom back in the mid-nineties.” The moves come amid growing concern about a bubble forming around artificial intelligence as the key players — namely Nvidia Corp. and OpenAI — pledge billions of dollars in deals with a cohort of companies making infrastructure for the technology. As more money is spent, there’s mounting fear that the trend will end in a crash the way it did 25 years ago following the dot-com euphoria, when heavy investments were made in anticipation of internet traffic that took much longer to materialize. An unwinding could be even more painful today, as the top tech stocks account for roughly 35% of the S&P 500 Index, compared with less than 15% in 1999. “The market is pricing these deals as if everyone who transacts with OpenAI will be a winner,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “OpenAI is a negative cash flow company and has nothing to lose by signing these deals. Investors should be more discerning. But this is a buy-first, ask-questions-later environment.” Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones said the current backdrop reminds him of the dot-com bubble in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday. “All the ingredients are in place for some kind of a blow off,” he said. “Will it happen again? History rhymes a lot, so I would think some version of it is going to happen again,” adding that this environment is “more potentially explosive than 1999.” One of the big concerns about the deals is their circular capital structures, with the companies using each other’s money to buy each other’s products, Mulberry said. In addition, the scale of the stock market moves for such large companies is alarming, he said. These are companies with “very large mature balance sheets that are participating in these types of rallies,” Mulberry said. “That is unusual, and it does cause a little bit of reflection.” To be sure, AMD’s climb may be justified because the OpenAI deal signifies a major step in its progress with graphics processing units, or GPUs, where it competes for market share with Nvidia. Wall Street analysts covering AMD generally cheered the news. “This agreement fundamentally shifts how the industry will view AMD’s competitive position going forward,” Benchmark analyst Cody Acree wrote in a note to clients on Monday, boosting the firm’s price target to $270 from $210. “Beyond the obvious revenue and earning accretion of the agreement, we believe this announcement is a ringing endorsement of AMD’s increasingly competitive position as a viable technical alternative to Nvidia’s AI GPU dominance.” Still, having multiple large technology stocks surge by double-digits in quick succession could be a sign that valuations have become disconnected from underlying fundamentals, and that investors are buying primarily based on the fear of missing out on further gains. “The price discovery is actually pretty scary,” Ted Mortonson, a technology strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., said after Oracle’s pop. A company that large, gaining so much market value that rapidly is “not good and normal,” he added. “I would call it a part of the exuberance bundle.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Time Published: 2025-10-07T14:57:32Z
Full Content:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares rose Tuesday after soaring yesterday to a 19-month high on news that the chip designer and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have inked a multi-year supply deal. Under the agreement, OpenAI is committing to buying several generations of AI chips from AMD in a long-term deal that could see it take a 10% stake in the Nvidia (NVDA) rival. AMD said it anticipates the ripple effect of the deal to net it more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers. AMD shares, which jumped 24% on Monday, were up more than 5% at around $215 in recent trading, putting the stock on pace for a record closing high. The stock is up 77% since the start of the year, handily outpacing Nvidia’s 40% return over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify critical price levels worth watching out for. AMD shares staged a dramatic breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Monday, laying the groundwork for follow-through buying. While the surge coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below peaks that preceded drawdowns in November 2021 and March 2024. However, the stock closed near its low for the day yesterday, indicating a short-term over-extension. Let’s point out two critical overhead areas to watch on AMD’s chart if the shares continue their bullish run and also identify support levels worth monitoring during potential pullbacks. If the chipmaker’s shares regain their upward momentum, investors should initially keep track of the $227 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near Monday's high, which coincidently sits just below the stock’s record intraday high set in March last year. Investors can project an overhead area to watch above the stock’s all-time high by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the study to AMD’s chart, we calculate the distance from the inverse head and shoulders’ head to neckline in points and add that amount to the pattern’s neckline. For example, adding $98 to $174 projects a bullish target of $272, about 34% above Monday's closing price. During retracements, it’s worth watching for a potential fill of yesterday's stock gap down to around $174. Investors would likely see this as a high probability buying area near the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which could flip from prior resistance to future support. Finally, a steeper pullback would open the door to a retest of the $150 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the inverse head and shoulders’ two shoulders, which closely align with the December 2023 high.

Title: Interactive Brokers’ Super Stock Still Looks Super Attractive

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. When American Eagle (AEO) launched its jeans campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney, the initial reaction was largely critical, with skeptics finding something to criticize at every opportunity. Yet, like the adage, no publicity is bad publicity, as the results speak for themselves. The collaboration, initially labeled as “controversial”, delivered a significant uplift in American Eagle’s sales, driving the stock up more than 35% in a single trading day. What began as skepticism became a clear example of how strategic brand initiatives can translate into meaningful shareholder value. In an increasingly discerning market, companies with strong businesses get rewarded. By leveraging my AI Agent for investing, I take it a step further by identifying quality companies that also have good stocks, and I highlight the best of those stocks in my Long Idea reports. My Long Idea this week features a company that benefits from strong macro tailwinds in its industry, has a low-cost advantage driven by its superior technology, and, best of all, its stock price looks cheap. With the rise in e-brokerages, access to capital markets and investing has never been greater. The clear winners, apart from investors, are the brokerage companies themselves. This e-brokerage company has a unique market leader position and is poised to capitalize on growth for years to come. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is this week’s Long Idea. We first unveiled IBKR as a Super Stock in September 2024. Super Stocks offer a very rare combination of qualities. They (1) earn a Very Attractive rating and (2) have businesses that generate economic earnings greater than GAAP earnings. Most importantly, Super Stocks outperform. For example, IBKR is up an impressive 110%+, compared to the S&P 500 rising 18%, since I unveiled it as a Super Stock. Even after this strong outperformance, IBKR looks undervalued and offers further upside potential. Rising retail investor participation, enabled by accessible and low-cost trading models, has reshaped the investment landscape. Technological innovation also plays a key role: mobile-first platforms with intuitive, gamified features attract new investors, while advanced tools that automate and accelerate processes support more experienced market participants and institutions. At the same time, consumer preferences are shifting decisively toward digital platforms that are easy to use, affordable, and highly automated, which positions the market for sustained expansion. Research and Markets forecasts the e-brokerage market will grow from $14.1 billion in 2024 to $34.6 billion in 2034, a CAGR of 9.4%. Figure 1: E-Brokerage Market Growth Forecast: 2024 – 2034 The Covid-19 pandemic marked a significant inflection point in retail investor activity. With increased time at home, limited alternative investment outlets, and heightened market volatility, millions of individuals turned to e-brokerage platforms as a primary means of accessing financial markets. At the time, market analysts thought the trend might prove transitory, but evidence indicates that retail stock trading has not only persisted but continues to grow. The accessibility of low-cost trading platforms, the democratization of financial information through digital channels, and a generational shift toward active investing have all contributed to sustained growth. So far in 2025, retail investors account for approximately 21% of daily trading volume on the Nasdaq, compared to just 10% in 2020. This trend serves as one of the primary tailwinds behind the expansion of the e-brokerage market. Looking ahead, demographic factors further support an upward trajectory. Younger cohorts, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are entering their peak income and savings years with a stronger predisposition toward direct market engagement and are more technologically savvy than previous generations. The growing interest of younger generations in capital markets is likely to benefit retail-focused, entry-level investment platforms, such as Robinhood (HOOD) and Webull (BULL), given their emphasis on simplicity and accessibility. However, as these investors gain experience and develop a deeper understanding of market strategies, their preferences are likely to shift toward platforms that provide more advanced tools and sophisticated capabilities, such as Interactive Brokers. Interactive Brokers is capitalizing on the macro tailwinds buffeting its industry. The company’s customer equity (the total value of all assets held by customers) increased 26% compounded annually over the last decade, from $56.7 billion in 2014 to $664.6 billion in 2Q25. Interactive Brokers ability to grow customer equity comes not only from rising account balances of existing users, but also attracting new users. The company’s total accounts grew from 281 thousand in 2014 to 3.9 million at the end of 2Q25. The total accounts grew 37% and 28% compounded annually over the last 5- and 10-years, respectively. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Interactive Brokers’ Total Accounts: 2014 – 2Q25 As a result, the company’s total customer daily average revenue trades (DARTs) increased from 564 thousand in 2014 to 3.6 million at the end of 2Q25. More importantly, Interactive Brokers’ total executed order volumes increased from 289 million in 2014 to 346 million in 2019 to 725 million in 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, total executed order volumes reached 488 million. Should trade volumes maintain at this rate, the company would execute 976 million orders in 2025, which would be 6% higher than 2024. See Figure 3. Of note, in 2024, the company’s total trade volumes surpassed the previous high set in 2020, when meme-stock activity drove record volumes. Figure 3: Interactive Brokers’ Total Executed Trade Volumes: 2014 – Annualized 2025 A big driver of Interactive Broker’s strong growth is superior offerings. Interactive Brokers is recognized as one of the industry leaders for its superior pricing, extensive international coverage, wide array of advanced trading tools, and advanced automation. Interactive Brokers was rated #1 in: In the next three sections, I dive into details on the advantages that Interactive Brokers’ superior offerings give its customers. Interactive Brokers leverages its proprietary technology to automate the entirety of the transaction lifecycle, which includes account opening, order routing, real-time risk management, securities lending, and regulatory spending. In fact, the majority of the company’s senior management are software engineers, which explains the success and focus on automating as many brokerage processes as possible. The company’s industry-leading automation enables it to run a low fixed cost and high margin business. One could argue that, historically, traditional brokerages are against automation, because more client interaction and touch points created more ways to deepen relationships and generate fees for manually performing tasks. Interactive Brokers took another route and made a big bet on automation. Now the firm is well-positioned to meet the demands and preferences of an increasingly experienced retail trader that prioritizes automation and low costs. I think Interactive Brokers’ bet on automation will continue to pay off for the company and its investors. Perhaps, most impressive about all this automation is that it supports one of the most sophisticated and flexible investing platforms in the world. Experienced investors consistently choose Interactive Brokers over its competitors because it offers 100+ order types (from limit orders to complex algorithmic trading), prime brokerage services, comprehensive reporting tools, and much more to enhance the investors’ experience. Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rates are significantly less than its main competitors, while its interest rate offered on cash balances over $10K is higher. Per Figure 3, Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rate for $25K borrowing is 5.8%, which is significantly lower than the 12.1%, 12.1%, 12.3%, and 12.7% offered by Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, and E-Trade, respectively. Figure 4: Interactive Brokers’ Margin Loan Rates vs Competitors as of June 2025 Interactive Brokers facilitates investing and trading on more countries and currencies compared to competitors. The company offers its financial products in 36 countries and 28 currencies, compared to Fidelity’s 25 countries and 16 currencies and Schwab’s 12 countries and 8 currencies. Although Interactive Brokers’ clientele is largely sophisticated/high level investors, the company keeps the pipeline of new clients loaded by attracting retail investors with streamlined solutions for beginners. In fact, the company even offers comprehensive education (IBKR Campus) courses, videos, and webinars for beginners on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, options trading, fixed income assets, as well as paper trading tools where investors can practice without using/risking real money. IBKR Campus offers a wider variety of education compared to Robinhood’s education offering, Robinhood Learn. Figure 5: IBKR Campus and Robinhood learn Education Offerings Comparison While growing customer accounts, volumes, and assets, Interactive Brokers has also grown its top- and bottom-line. The company has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 23% and 22% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 6. The company’s NOPAT margin fell slightly from 42% in 2014 to 39% in the TTM, while its invested capital turns rose from 0.2 to 0.6 over the same time. Rising invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 9% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM. Additionally, Interactive Brokers’ Core Earnings, a cleaner version of earnings, grew from $45 million in 2014 to $838 million in the TTM, or 32% compounded annually. Figure 6: Interactive Brokers’ Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 On top of being recognized as the best in the industry across multiple categories, Interactive Brokers is also the most profitable brokerage company among publicly-traded competitors. Interactive Brokers has the highest ROIC and the second highest NOPAT margin among publicly traded peers, which include Robinhood (HOOD), eToro (ETOR), JPMorgan (JPM), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and more. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Interactive Brokers’ Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Note: we include Net Interest Income in total revenue for Robinhood because the company does not break out Interest Income and Interest expense. For the other companies, only Interest Income is included in Total Revenue and Interest expense is deducted separately like other operating expenses. As a result, the NOPAT margin for Robinhood is higher than usual, while its Invested Capital Turns are low. The opposite is true for the other companies in Figure 7. ROIC is the main number on which investors should focus. Interactive Brokers does return capital to shareholders through dividends, though the yield is minimal. Since 2019, Interactive Brokers has paid $337 million (1% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.03/share in 1Q19 to $0.08/share in calendar 3Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.5% yield. The company hasn’t repurchased any shares over the same time and hasn’t mentioned anything about starting to repurchase shares. Interactive Brokers consistently generates high free cash flow (FCF). Per Figure 8, From 2019 through the first half of 2025, the company generated $2.7 billion in FCF, which equals 6% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 8: Interactive Brokers’ Cumulative FCF: 2019 – 1H25 Interactive Brokers has the capital strength to weather any uncertainty in the foreseeable future. The company earns a Very Attractive overall Credit Rating and scores an Attractive-or-better rating for all five credit rating criteria. See Figure 9. Figure 9: Interactive Brokers’ Credit Rating Details Trade volumes are critical for brokerage companies, so bear markets present unique challenges, more so than short-term volatility. Analyzing how Interactive Brokers handled prior down markets (2022 and 2008 for instance) gives me an idea of how they might handle one in the future. First, I note that Interactive Brokers remained profitable in both 2008 and 2022, even as the market took a turn for the worst. How did the company remain profitable while other firms hemorrhaged cash? The company is well-positioned to take market share from big brokers like Schwab and Fidelity due to its lower fees and margin loan rates. Should economic conditions deteriorate, investors and hedge funds, will gravitate towards lower cost offerings, and IBKR offers the lowest. Lastly, Interactive Brokers’ large asset base provides ample opportunity, throughout nearly all market cycles. At its current price of $64/share, IBKR has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s NOPAT to never grow from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic considering Interactive Brokers has grown NOPAT by 25%, 22% and 14% compounded annually over the past 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for IBKR. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: IBKR would be worth $64/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT would grow just 3% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth at least $91/share today – a 42% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT grows just 5% compounded annually from 2025 through 2034. Should Interactive Brokers grow profits grow more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 10 compares the company’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios. Figure 10: Interactive Brokers’ Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Here’s a summary of why I think the moat around Interactive Brokers’ business will enable it to continue to generate higher NOPAT than the current market valuation implies: These days, fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder-aligned corporate governance. Due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus is on short-term technical trading trends while more reliable fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary of what noise traders are missing: Interactive Brokers has beaten earnings estimates in 4 of the past 10 quarters, so doing so more consistently could send shares higher. Also, the company’s consistent top- and bottom-line growth help explain IBKR outperforming the overall Financial sector since the beginning of this year. Year-to-date, IBKR is up 36% while the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up just 12%. More consistent earnings beats could send shares even higher and further extend the stock’s outperformance. Interactive Brokers’ executives receive performance awards based on three criteria: pre-tax income, adjusted pre-tax profit margin, and three-year adjusted net revenue growth. We would prefer the company tie executive compensation to ROIC. Doing so ensures that executives’ interests are more aligned with shareholders’ interests as there is a strong correlation between improving ROIC and increasing shareholder value. Improving ROIC requires attention to all areas of the business, so including it in an executive compensation plan would incentivize executives to improve the entire business, not just one sales goal or earnings number. Despite using adjusted pre-tax income and revenue growth goals in its executive pay, Interactive Brokers’ management has grown economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, 30% compounded annually over the last decade, from $141 million in 2014 to $2.3 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25. Over the past twelve months, insiders have purchased 1.7 million shares and sold 1.1 million shares for a net effect of 604,581 shares bought. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding. There are currently 10.0 million shares sold short, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and two days to cover. The following funds receive an Attractive-or-better rating and allocate significantly to IBKR:

Even after this strong outperformance, IBKR looks undervalued and offers further upside potential. Rising retail investor participation, enabled by accessible and low-cost trading models, has reshaped the investment landscape. Technological innovation also plays a key role: mobile-first platforms with intuitive, gamified features attract new investors, while advanced tools that automate and accelerate processes support more experienced market participants and institutions. At the same time, consumer preferences are shifting decisively toward digital platforms that are easy to use, affordable, and highly automated, which positions the market for sustained expansion. Research and Markets forecasts the e-brokerage market will grow from $14.1 billion in 2024 to $34.6 billion in 2034, a CAGR of 9.4%. Figure 1: E-Brokerage Market Growth Forecast: 2024 – 2034 The Covid-19 pandemic marked a significant inflection point in retail investor activity. With increased time at home, limited alternative investment outlets, and heightened market volatility, millions of individuals turned to e-brokerage platforms as a primary means of accessing financial markets. At the time, market analysts thought the trend might prove transitory, but evidence indicates that retail stock trading has not only persisted but continues to grow. The accessibility of low-cost trading platforms, the democratization of financial information through digital channels, and a generational shift toward active investing have all contributed to sustained growth. So far in 2025, retail investors account for approximately 21% of daily trading volume on the Nasdaq, compared to just 10% in 2020. This trend serves as one of the primary tailwinds behind the expansion of the e-brokerage market. Looking ahead, demographic factors further support an upward trajectory. Younger cohorts, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are entering their peak income and savings years with a stronger predisposition toward direct market engagement and are more technologically savvy than previous generations. The growing interest of younger generations in capital markets is likely to benefit retail-focused, entry-level investment platforms, such as Robinhood (HOOD) and Webull (BULL), given their emphasis on simplicity and accessibility. However, as these investors gain experience and develop a deeper understanding of market strategies, their preferences are likely to shift toward platforms that provide more advanced tools and sophisticated capabilities, such as Interactive Brokers. Interactive Brokers is capitalizing on the macro tailwinds buffeting its industry. The company’s customer equity (the total value of all assets held by customers) increased 26% compounded annually over the last decade, from $56.7 billion in 2014 to $664.6 billion in 2Q25. Interactive Brokers ability to grow customer equity comes not only from rising account balances of existing users, but also attracting new users. The company’s total accounts grew from 281 thousand in 2014 to 3.9 million at the end of 2Q25. The total accounts grew 37% and 28% compounded annually over the last 5- and 10-years, respectively. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Interactive Brokers’ Total Accounts: 2014 – 2Q25 As a result, the company’s total customer daily average revenue trades (DARTs) increased from 564 thousand in 2014 to 3.6 million at the end of 2Q25. More importantly, Interactive Brokers’ total executed order volumes increased from 289 million in 2014 to 346 million in 2019 to 725 million in 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, total executed order volumes reached 488 million. Should trade volumes maintain at this rate, the company would execute 976 million orders in 2025, which would be 6% higher than 2024. See Figure 3. Of note, in 2024, the company’s total trade volumes surpassed the previous high set in 2020, when meme-stock activity drove record volumes. Figure 3: Interactive Brokers’ Total Executed Trade Volumes: 2014 – Annualized 2025 A big driver of Interactive Broker’s strong growth is superior offerings. Interactive Brokers is recognized as one of the industry leaders for its superior pricing, extensive international coverage, wide array of advanced trading tools, and advanced automation. Interactive Brokers was rated #1 in: In the next three sections, I dive into details on the advantages that Interactive Brokers’ superior offerings give its customers. Interactive Brokers leverages its proprietary technology to automate the entirety of the transaction lifecycle, which includes account opening, order routing, real-time risk management, securities lending, and regulatory spending. In fact, the majority of the company’s senior management are software engineers, which explains the success and focus on automating as many brokerage processes as possible. The company’s industry-leading automation enables it to run a low fixed cost and high margin business. One could argue that, historically, traditional brokerages are against automation, because more client interaction and touch points created more ways to deepen relationships and generate fees for manually performing tasks. Interactive Brokers took another route and made a big bet on automation. Now the firm is well-positioned to meet the demands and preferences of an increasingly experienced retail trader that prioritizes automation and low costs. I think Interactive Brokers’ bet on automation will continue to pay off for the company and its investors. Perhaps, most impressive about all this automation is that it supports one of the most sophisticated and flexible investing platforms in the world. Experienced investors consistently choose Interactive Brokers over its competitors because it offers 100+ order types (from limit orders to complex algorithmic trading), prime brokerage services, comprehensive reporting tools, and much more to enhance the investors’ experience. Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rates are significantly less than its main competitors, while its interest rate offered on cash balances over $10K is higher. Per Figure 3, Interactive Brokers’ margin loan rate for $25K borrowing is 5.8%, which is significantly lower than the 12.1%, 12.1%, 12.3%, and 12.7% offered by Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, and E-Trade, respectively. Figure 4: Interactive Brokers’ Margin Loan Rates vs Competitors as of June 2025 Interactive Brokers facilitates investing and trading on more countries and currencies compared to competitors. The company offers its financial products in 36 countries and 28 currencies, compared to Fidelity’s 25 countries and 16 currencies and Schwab’s 12 countries and 8 currencies. Although Interactive Brokers’ clientele is largely sophisticated/high level investors, the company keeps the pipeline of new clients loaded by attracting retail investors with streamlined solutions for beginners. In fact, the company even offers comprehensive education (IBKR Campus) courses, videos, and webinars for beginners on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, options trading, fixed income assets, as well as paper trading tools where investors can practice without using/risking real money. IBKR Campus offers a wider variety of education compared to Robinhood’s education offering, Robinhood Learn. Figure 5: IBKR Campus and Robinhood learn Education Offerings Comparison While growing customer accounts, volumes, and assets, Interactive Brokers has also grown its top- and bottom-line. The company has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 23% and 22% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 6. The company’s NOPAT margin fell slightly from 42% in 2014 to 39% in the TTM, while its invested capital turns rose from 0.2 to 0.6 over the same time. Rising invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 9% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM. Additionally, Interactive Brokers’ Core Earnings, a cleaner version of earnings, grew from $45 million in 2014 to $838 million in the TTM, or 32% compounded annually. Figure 6: Interactive Brokers’ Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 On top of being recognized as the best in the industry across multiple categories, Interactive Brokers is also the most profitable brokerage company among publicly-traded competitors. Interactive Brokers has the highest ROIC and the second highest NOPAT margin among publicly traded peers, which include Robinhood (HOOD), eToro (ETOR), JPMorgan (JPM), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and more. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Interactive Brokers’ Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Interactive Brokers does return capital to shareholders through dividends, though the yield is minimal. Since 2019, Interactive Brokers has paid $337 million (1% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividend from $0.03/share in 1Q19 to $0.08/share in calendar 3Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.5% yield. The company hasn’t repurchased any shares over the same time and hasn’t mentioned anything about starting to repurchase shares. Interactive Brokers consistently generates high free cash flow (FCF). Per Figure 8, From 2019 through the first half of 2025, the company generated $2.7 billion in FCF, which equals 6% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 8: Interactive Brokers’ Cumulative FCF: 2019 – 1H25 Interactive Brokers has the capital strength to weather any uncertainty in the foreseeable future. The company earns a Very Attractive overall Credit Rating and scores an Attractive-or-better rating for all five credit rating criteria. See Figure 9. Figure 9: Interactive Brokers’ Credit Rating Details Trade volumes are critical for brokerage companies, so bear markets present unique challenges, more so than short-term volatility. Analyzing how Interactive Brokers handled prior down markets (2022 and 2008 for instance) gives me an idea of how they might handle one in the future. First, I note that Interactive Brokers remained profitable in both 2008 and 2022, even as the market took a turn for the worst. How did the company remain profitable while other firms hemorrhaged cash? The company is well-positioned to take market share from big brokers like Schwab and Fidelity due to its lower fees and margin loan rates. Should economic conditions deteriorate, investors and hedge funds, will gravitate towards lower cost offerings, and IBKR offers the lowest. Lastly, Interactive Brokers’ large asset base provides ample opportunity, throughout nearly all market cycles. At its current price of $64/share, IBKR has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s NOPAT to never grow from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic considering Interactive Brokers has grown NOPAT by 25%, 22% and 14% compounded annually over the past 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for IBKR. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: IBKR would be worth $64/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT would grow just 3% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth at least $91/share today – a 42% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Interactive Brokers’ NOPAT grows just 5% compounded annually from 2025 through 2034. Should Interactive Brokers grow profits grow more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 10 compares the company’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios. Figure 10: Interactive Brokers’ Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Here’s a summary of why I think the moat around Interactive Brokers’ business will enable it to continue to generate higher NOPAT than the current market valuation implies: These days, fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder-aligned corporate governance. Due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus is on short-term technical trading trends while more reliable fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary of what noise traders are missing: Interactive Brokers has beaten earnings estimates in 4 of the past 10 quarters, so doing so more consistently could send shares higher. Also, the company’s consistent top- and bottom-line growth help explain IBKR outperforming the overall Financial sector since the beginning of this year. Year-to-date, IBKR is up 36% while the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up just 12%. More consistent earnings beats could send shares even higher and further extend the stock’s outperformance. Interactive Brokers’ executives receive performance awards based on three criteria: pre-tax income, adjusted pre-tax profit margin, and three-year adjusted net revenue growth. We would prefer the company tie executive compensation to ROIC. Doing so ensures that executives’ interests are more aligned with shareholders’ interests as there is a strong correlation between improving ROIC and increasing shareholder value. Improving ROIC requires attention to all areas of the business, so including it in an executive compensation plan would incentivize executives to improve the entire business, not just one sales goal or earnings number. Despite using adjusted pre-tax income and revenue growth goals in its executive pay, Interactive Brokers’ management has grown economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, 30% compounded annually over the last decade, from $141 million in 2014 to $2.3 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25. Over the past twelve months, insiders have purchased 1.7 million shares and sold 1.1 million shares for a net effect of 604,581 shares bought. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding. There are currently 10.0 million shares sold short, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and two days to cover. The following funds receive an Attractive-or-better rating and allocate significantly to IBKR:

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Mettler-Toledo International (MTD) is currently on a strong uptrend, marking its fifth consecutive day of gains for a total increase of 13% over this period. This run has added approximately $3.6 billion to the company’s valuation, bringing its current market capitalization to around $28 billion. Despite these recent gains, the stock’s year-to-date return of 9.0% still lags the S&P 500's return of 14.6%. The immediate catalyst for the current rise is a recently raised price target by a Wall Street analyst. However, even after this latest upward momentum, we find MTD stock unattractive. MTD manufactures precision laboratory and industrial instruments, such as balances, pipetting solutions, titrators, pH meters, weighing instruments, and automated measurement and data collection systems. Following this rally, is MTD still worth buying – or should you consider securing your profits? Explore further with Buy or Sell MTD. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The table below outlines the return of MTD stock as compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the current streak: What is the point? Momentum often precedes conviction. A multi-day winning streak can indicate increasing investor confidence or trigger additional buying. Monitoring such patterns can assist in capitalizing on the momentum or preparing for a strategically timed entry should the momentum wane. Currently, 83 S&P constituents have experienced 3 or more consecutive days of gains, and 41 constituents have faced 3 or more consecutive days of losses. While MTD stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, putting money into a single stock without thorough and detailed analysis can be precarious. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GOOGL stock is up 32% this year, benefiting from a stock rerating post-regulatory victory on its Chrome browser and strong tailwinds from AI demand. Despite this impressive performance, we believe that its peer, META stock, is now a more compelling investment choice. Why? Meta is Google’s counterpart in the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: This discrepancy between valuation and actual performance indicates that buying META stock may be more beneficial than picking GOOGL stock at current levels. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL or META, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio However, do these figures reveal the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine whether GOOGL maintains a competitive edge beneath the surface. To provide context, GOOGL offers a wide range of products and services that include advertisements, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across multiple sectors. A way to evaluate if GOOGL stock is currently overpriced compared to the other stocks would involve comparing these metrics from a year ago. If there has been a significant shift in GOOGL’s trend in the past 12 months, it is possible that the current discrepancy might revert. On the contrary, a continuous underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for GOOGL would bolster the viewpoint that the stock is indeed overpriced relative to its competitors, but may not correct itself in the near term. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors.

Title: The Trouble with Tech Companies (and Their Strategies)

A conversation with writer Cory Doctorow about why tech companies seem to deprioritize users. Cory Doctorow, author and digital rights advocate, argues that big tech companies from Facebook to Google and beyond have evolved – or devolved – in a disappointing way. He says that many large tech companies begin with a good product, but that over time they prioritize first business customers, and then ultimately shareholders and profits over end users. That creates a decline in service quality, and Doctorow explains why that’s bad for customers, companies, and the broader economy and society. Doctorow wrote the new book Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It. ADI IGNATIUS: I am Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: So Alison, there are times when someone puts their finger on something that we sense and that we experience, but we don’t yet have a word for. ALISON BEARD: Such as? ADI IGNATIUS: Well, Clay Christensen did that with disruption. The term is overused now to refer to almost any business challenge, but his definition was very precise. When newcomers start at the bottom of the market, win customers there and innovate up the value chain to displace the incumbent. So now Cory Doctorow, a well-known tech writer, has put his finger on another phenomenon that did not have a name, and that is the gradual evolution, he would say deterioration of tech platforms. So Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and so on. We fall in love with them, but they evolve into something we fall out of love with, but we’re kind of stuck in their world and he calls that the enshitification of these services. Okay, this is not a family-friendly term, but it was picked as the word of the year by a couple of big dictionaries. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. That is definitely not a word that I’m very comfortable saying, even though I can generally swear with the best of them. But I do know exactly what you’re talking about, and I think it happens in lots of areas. There’s a product or service or platform as you say, that starts really great and then gets worse over time because the organization, whether it’s public or private, becomes less focused and complacent. In a perfect world, the market would punish them for that. There would be clay as disruptors and consumers or business clients could take their money elsewhere. But I guess if they’re dominant in their corner of the industry or their geography, that’s sometimes not feasible. So I’d love to know if there’s a solution. ADI IGNATIUS: So that’s what we’re talking about. So my guest this week is Cory Doctorow, journalist, writer, keen observer of the contemporary tech world, and author of the new book, Enshitification, Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It. So here’s our conversation. CORY DOCTOROW: I’ve worked for a digital rights group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which defends digital rights online, and I’ve been working for them for 24 years, all my adult life, and I have tried many ways of engaging people with these very abstract techno, social, political critiques of how our platforms are regulated and how they operate. It turns out that swearing was the secret that cracked the nut, that giving people a minor license to a bit of profanity makes them very happy and lets them go out and do it. So enshitification at its crux is a description of how platforms decay backed by theory of why they decay. Platforms are first good to their end users. They lure those end users in, they find a locus of lock-ins, so the users can’t readily leave once those users are locked in, they make things worse for those end users in order to tempt in business customers. One way to think about this that’s very straightforward is Facebook went from promising users they would never spy on them, to spying on them a lot. Having locked in those business customers, they then abuse those business customers as well. And the end goal is to draw out all surplus value allocated to shareholders and executives and create an equilibrium where there’s just the minimum homeopathic residue of value left to keep users locked in and then keep business customers locked to users, and to return all surplus value to shareholders and executives. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, now surely we must have some agency here. I mean, why can’t we just leave the platforms when we agree that they’ve gotten lousy? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, that’s where the lock-in comes in. And maybe I’ll work backwards here and talk about lock-in of business customers. So we have got a lot of discursive and theoretical attention on monopoly, powerful sellers. But we don’t pay a lot of attention to monopsony, which is powerful buyers. If you operate a firm, you understand that if a customer accounts for, say, 20 or 30% of your turnover, and they just stop doing business with you overnight, that is catastrophic. Anyone who’s ever done business with Walmart knows what this looks like. But also everyone who’s still putting videos on YouTube as they crank down the compensation to creators knows what this looks like. It’s very hard to escape a powerful buyer. But in terms of consumer lock-in, there’s many different ways of accomplishing it. This is, I think the primary source of innovation in Silicon Valley is finding ways to lock in end users. So you can do it in concert with the state. Since 1998, America has had a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. And Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence in a $500,000 fine for defeating an access control. And so if there’s software in a device, and the only way to modify it is to bypass something that says, don’t modify this software, the act of modifying the software, even if you don’t infringe anyone’s copyright, even if you don’t violate anyone’s law, is a felony that you can go to jail for five years for. And so this is how you get lock in with printer ink. So the companies have merged to a cartel. Four giant companies control all the printers. They have fitted the printer cartridges with security chips that are a software lock and access control, and it checks to see whether you’re using an OEM cartridge with the original ink in it or whether you’ve refilled or bought a third party ink cartridge. And what this does is it creates a switching cost where if you want to leave your printer behind and go to one that takes third party ink, if you can find it, because the cartel have crushed those printer companies, you have to surrender all the ink that’s remaining in your other three toner cartridges and the cost of the printer as well. And so, a lot of users don’t switch, because at any given moment, the kind of economically rational thing is to stick with the printer. And so we see printer ink monotonically increasing in price. And today printer ink is the most expensive fluid you can buy as a civilian without obtaining a government permit. But it’s not just this kind of technological or state lock-in. You have Uber, which was able to violate the black letter of antitrust law by doing predatory pricing, selling goods below cost in order to remove competitors from the market. They lost 41 cents on every dollar they made for 13 years, and they crushed all potential competitors except for an also ran, which is Lyft. And so in many places now the bus isn’t coming, there isn’t a regular taxi company and it’s just Uber. And so Uber raises the price and what are you going to do? ADI IGNATIUS: So you mentioned Facebook, why don’t you talk whether it’s about Facebook or another platform, sort of step-by-step, how a platform, we fall in love with it for good reason, and then something happens? So talk in more detail about how a platform goes from great stuff to crappy stuff. CORY DOCTOROW: So when Facebook started off as a public service, they had a problem, which was that everyone who could have been using Facebook and who wanted social media already had a social media account on another service called MySpace. And so they made a pitch to them. They said, “Come to Facebook. We are like MySpace except that we will never spy on you and we’ll never show you anything you didn’t ask to see. So that was stage one. So as those end users piled into Facebook, they did Facebook’s work for them. They found a way to lock themselves in, and they did so through something economists called the collective action problem. When there’s 200 of you and you’re all stuck to Facebook, and some of you’re there because that’s where the people have the same rare disease as them meet, and some of you’re there because that’s how they plan the carpool for the league their kids are in, and some are there because they emigrated, and that’s the only way to stay in touch with the people they left back home. And some are there because that’s how they find their audience or their customers. Then the fact that you are dissatisfied with Facebook has to overwhelm the fact that you are very much dependent on your friends, and so long as you love your friends more than you hate Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg can make things worse for you in order to make things better for another group of users. So that’s where stage two starts. We draw down some of the value that has been given to end users in order to allocate it to a different group of users. The business customers, in Facebook’s case that was publishers and advertisers. So Mark Zuckerberg violates his promises and he goes to the advertisers and he says, “Do you remember when these rubes signed up for Facebook? We told them we weren’t going to spy on them. The actual fact is we spy on them with every hour that God sends, and for a remarkably small amount of money, we will target ads to them with incredible fidelity. We will devote enormous resources to make sure that when you give us a dollar to show an ad to a specific kind of user, that is the kind of user, and they definitely get shown the ad before you get billed.” So that business customers they pile in too, and they become dependent on those end users because very quickly Facebook becomes a critical source of business to their firms and they can’t replace them overnight and they can’t afford to go away. So that’s stage two. In stage three, Facebook exploits the fact that business customers and end users are all locked together, and so it starts to withdraw value from both of them in order to allocate it to shareholders and investors. So if you’re an advertiser, you find that the price of advertising has gone way up, but the fidelity of ad targeting has gone way down. So advertising costs go up, ad fraud goes through the roof. In 2017, Procter & Gamble zeroed out their programmatic advertising spend. They had been spending $200 million a year on surveillance ads or programmatic ads, and when they went to zero, they saw a 0% drop in sales, because to a first approximation, P&G’s ads were either not being seen by anyone, it was just being consumed by ad fraud, or they were being seen by the wrong people. They were just being misdirected by indifferently tended ad targeting systems. Publishers also faced rising costs, so they had to put longer and longer excerpts just to be shown to their own subscribers. And to get recommended that, excerpts had to be longer still and nothing would show up if they put a link back to their own website. And Facebook said, “Oh, we can’t tell if those are malicious links,” with the effect that they become commodity back end suppliers to Facebook. The stuff they post is perfectly substitutive for the material on their own website. Meanwhile, end users have found that the share of content that they’ve asked to see in their feed is almost nonexistent, to create a void into which Facebook can stuff things people will pay to show them to see. That’s the end of it. Stage three enshitification. ADI IGNATIUS: This is great analysis, and it’s a little bit like Clay Christensen with disruption theory that’s very specific, and your analysis is very specific to what happens with platforms. I’m wondering, to what extent should our listeners care? I mean, I think most of us have a deal with the internet where we say, all right, I’m not comfortable with every aspect of it. I’m maybe not comfortable with the surveillance aspect of it, but it’s working for me. I mean, there’s some trade-off of convenience versus the negative stuff. So yeah, I wish it were better, but it’s working fine for me. Why should our listeners care? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, I think increasingly it’s not working for people. So in a way that I think most people can relate to, Google with a 90% search market who were just allowed to go on by federal judge, given permission to go on paying Apple $20 billion a year not to enter the search market, with a competitor that might impose discipline on them, even having lost an antitrust case. I think we all understand that our gateway to knowledge on the internet kind of sucks now, but there are ways that this becomes much more pointed. So nurses, contract nurses are very common in America, because hospitals are trying to do union avoidance. And it used to be that contract nurses were supplied by local firms, several local firms in every market, and now they’ve been replaced by, depending on how you count, three or four giant apps, each of which calls itself Uber for nurses. And because the monopolies capture their regulators, those giant apps are able to violate the privacy of those nurses in ways that shifts giant amounts of money from labor to capital. So before a shift is given to a nurse, the app buys their credit history from a data broker. Data brokers are unregulated in America. Under Biden, we got a rule regulating them. Under Trump, that rule was rescinded. And the last time Congress gave us a law about this, a consumer privacy law was in 1988, when the Video Privacy Protection Act banned video store clerks from disclosing your VHS rental history. We haven’t had a single new consumer privacy law since then. And so they’re able to buy the credit history of nurses, and they are looking for how much credit card debt the nurses are carrying, and how delinquent it is. And the more economically desperate you are, the lower the wage you’re offered. And so this is very bad for nurses, clearly, but if you’re getting a catheter inserted today by a nurse who had to drive Uber till midnight the night before in order to make rent and couldn’t afford breakfast this morning, that’s bad for you too. ADI IGNATIUS: So doesn’t everything get worse? I mean, we’re looking at these platforms in and say, “Man, it’s getting…” Is this really unique to internet platforms? Obviously the details are specific to them, but isn’t this things get worse over time or capitalism leads to exploitation over time? Is this really unique to tech companies and what they’ve created? CORY DOCTOROW: There are sources of discipline on firms that used to operate on firms and that I argue have ceased to operate on firms. So historically, firms had to worry about competitors, but we have seen since the Carter years, a drawdown of antitrust law, with the exception of late Trump one and the Biden years where we saw revival of it. And that has allowed firms to just buy each other and eliminate competitors, so they don’t have to worry about you leaving. So the most obvious example of this would be Facebook buying Instagram. And so we don’t have competitors as a source of discipline. And when firms when they cartelize, when there’s only like five of them or four or three or two or one, they find it really easy to come to an agreement about what their lobbying posture is going to be. So think of Uber and Lyft agreeing to spend $225 million collectively on Prop 22 here in California that formalize the worker misclassification they do to treat employees as contractors. These companies may be competitors in some sense, but not when it comes to talking to regulators or getting policy over the line. And so all of that stuff, that acts on every firm. One company called Luxottica Esselor has bought every brand of eyeglasses you’ve ever heard of. And every place you buy glasses, from Sunglass Hut to Lenscrafters. And they’ve raised the price of glasses over the last 10 years, so they’ve gotten worse. So what’s the difference between glasses and computers or technology? It’s that there were other forces of discipline that worked on tech platforms, and that those forces of discipline that were tech specific also went away. And those two forces, one is that the tech workforce was historically very powerful because they were scarce, and a lot of them, I call them Tron-pilled, they fought for the user. Tech worker scarcity has gone away, we saw half million layoffs in the sector in the last three years. And then the other one is a very interesting one called interoperability, which is making a technology that makes another technology work better. That used to be the order of the day. If a company made its technology worse, someone else would make a technology that made it better and steal your customers from you. But the growth of IP law has neutralized that as well. So the erosion of discipline has led to the worsening of things. It’s not the iron laws of economics or the great forces of history, it’s specific policy choices that were predicted to have this outcome and that did have this outcome. ADI IGNATIUS: You don’t write much in the book about AI and I think you’re right, the Google search is… We would’ve imagined several years ago that Google search would be much better than it’s, and in your book you talk about some of the reasons why it’s intentionally not as good as it could be. But AI for all its limitations, for all its factual mistakes, it’s pretty good. I think AI search is pretty good and certainly better than classic Google search at this point. Do you think AI providers are likely to go through the same process or that maybe AI gives us an alternative, gives us agency amid some of these problems here? CORY DOCTOROW: I think that we have to understand that the investment in AI, which is extraordinary, the indisputably extraordinary, has been driven by exactly one thing, and it’s not making cool pictures. It’s not AI search. It’s the prospect of displacing labor. When Gartner says there’s $13 trillion in AI, what they mean is that there’s 13 trillion in wages that can be shifted from labor to capital. That’s foundationally what they’re talking about. And while there’s lots of other stuff going on, I think we have to keep our eyes on the prize. And I think that it’s important to note that whatever merit AI has for search or anything else, it’s actually not very good at doing people’s jobs. Like AI salesmen are much better at convincing a boss to fire a worker and replace them with an AI that can’t do their job, than AI is at doing that worker’s job, partly because they’re pushing on an open door. Bosses would love to reduce their wage bills. That is the first characteristic of being a boss, is to find ways to reduce your wage bills, because it’s an input that is something that feels like you should be able to reduce it through automation. As to whether AI is going to make this better or worse, I think mostly it’s going to make it worse. One of the use cases where AI really is very good is surveillance pricing. It’s really good at figuring out how to tighter an offer on a per user basis, whether that’s a wage offer or a pricing offer to find the minimum you’re willing to accept as a worker and the maximum you’re willing to pay as a customer. I think it’s just a pure transfer from consumers and workers. ADI IGNATIUS: Let’s get to the part of this conversation that is, all right, so what do we do about it? There are various approaches. There’s what policymakers can do, there’s what users can do. There’s what businesses that are part of these two-sided platforms can do. How about we start with businesses who appreciate your argument and say, “Yes, we’ve lost power, we’ve lost agency, we’re not happy.” I mean, your P&G example, we’re spending all this money and getting nothing in return. What can business do to try to change all of this? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, I have to say, I don’t think there’s much businesses or individuals can do. This is a policy question. I mean, what can businesses do? They can shift the policy landscape. One of the things we have to recognize is that Chamber of Commerce is extraordinarily bad at representing the interests of SMEs and often lobbies for things that SMEs owners are extremely hostile to, in order to please its largest members. And those largest members are predatory upon SMEs. But there are some large enterprises that have taken big swings at changing the policy landscape. And the best example I can think of here is Epic, makers of the video game Fortnite. Epic has sued both in the EU and the US, Google and Apple with mixed success, but some stunning successes including a federal case against Google, rather for antitrust violations. It’s going to benefit every SME that uses those platforms as having 30 cents taken out of every dollar they make in processing fees. Often the local chambers of commerce are better, and they need to find industry associations that don’t incorporate the monopolists that prey on them and that are seeking to collect rents from them, because they have these choke points in the economy. Because you can’t clear the choke point just by having a better product. If you do retail business and you want to reach customers in America, 90% of affluent households have Prime, and 90% of Prime households start their search on Amazon. If they find what they’re looking for, they don’t shop anywhere else, which means that you must be on Amazon to reach those customers. Amazon’s taking 45 to 51 cents out of every platform dollar generated by third party sellers. They take so much out of sellers that they don’t have to pay anything for Prime for their own package fulfillment. They have 100% subsidy on Amazon package fulfillment, how many businesses can really operate on a 45 to 51% margin? And on top of that, Amazon has now, it used to be an explicit, now it’s a tacit most favored nation principle where if you sell more cheaply anywhere other than Amazon, Amazon buries you in the search results on page 11 million, which means that if you raise your prices on Amazon to make up for the 45 to 51 cents that you’re spending at every dollar and platform fees, you’ve got to also raise your prices at Walmart, Target and your warehouse store. Otherwise, Amazon will effectively delist you and then you won’t reach 90% of American consumers. You can’t fix that by having a better product or better product messaging or better pricing. The only way you can fix that is with private rights of action in antitrust law and industrial associations that back them. ADI IGNATIUS: And are you optimistic that any of that could happen? You and I know the U.S. best in the U.S. in this climate. CORY DOCTOROW: Well, the U.S. has certainly done a lot of backsliding. For four years under Biden, we had a lot of focus on SMEs and fairness for SMEs at the expense of these big rent-seeking platforms, and that’s all been rolled back. What’s happening that’s very interesting though, is that under the last years of Trump one and under Biden, and I know you want to talk about America, but internationally in Canada, the EU, Australia, Japan, South Korea and China, we’ve seen this really muscular new wave of enforcement against large firms since 2019. And political science has no explanation for it, because it’s a bedrock of political science that if you examine policy outcomes, that they universally and exclusively reflect the preferences of the largest firms and the richest people. It literally doesn’t matter how popular something is with the public, if billionaires don’t like it never happens. And this is kind of the first time that’s happened in generations. And so something amazing is happening in our political landscape. This is, it’s like gravity started working in reverse and no one’s noticed, and no one even has investigated the causes of it. I am both baffled and heartened by this, because something has changed everywhere in a way that no one can explain, and that is really to the betterment of everyone who wants a fair and more open society, even as the outward signs are getting more closed and less fair. This tailwind, which is blowing so ferociously in the sales of policymakers all over the world, coming from somewhere, it’s coming. I think from if you’re in finance, you’ll know Stein’s law, anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop. It’s coming from having reached the limits of rent extraction and neo-feudalism, and there just being some inchoate force that’s changing things. ADI IGNATIUS: You’ve studied technology and you’ve studied the people who own the big technology firms. I still don’t entirely understand why some of these very idealistic people who created technologies, in fact, to make the world a better place, to find the source of all knowledge or to connect people they brought labor in who were part of the mission. So then at some point, they become CEOs of these companies and not only want to succeed, but want to destroy. Want to monopolize, want to wipe out, want to maximize everything you’re talking about. How does that happen? How do these people who invent something magical and idealistic in their garages, all it seems evolve into the worst kind of almost cartoonish predatory capitalists? How does that happen? CORY DOCTOROW: Many of our social structures are oriented around the tacit or even the explicit idea that we’re really good at kidding ourselves, that we’re really good at rationalizing our way into trouble. The scientific method, the reason you’d expose your findings to adversarial peer review where you let people who hate you and want you to fail, find the mistakes you’ve made is because it’s really easy to kid yourself that the reason you didn’t get the result you expected was because you made a mistake in the experiment and not because you were wrong and to just fudge your results. You read Adam Smith and he’s like, the greediest bastards alive will make something good for you if they fear that they will be ruined if they don’t. It is not through the generosity of the baker that we expect our bread. It is through his self-regard, because in a market society where there are competitors the baker knows that if he puts gravel and rat poison in the bread, that you’re going to buy your bread somewhere else, even if he can save a lot of money doing it that way. So what we did was we removed the sources of discipline. Being shriven of all sources of discipline allows your stupidest ideas to conquer your life. ADI IGNATIUS: So having written this book, having gotten it out, are you feeling more hopeful or more pessimistic about the future of the internet? CORY DOCTOROW: Hope and pessimism are not opposites. Optimism and pessimism are the belief that things are just going to happen no matter what, and humans don’t have a role in them. They’re both fatalism. Hope does not mean that you think things will go well. It means that you can see a way to make them better, and you have the epistemic humility to say, even though I don’t know what I will do after I make things a little better, I am willing to count into the possibility that if I change my vantage point by ascending the gradient towards a better future, even just a little, that there may be terrain that I can’t perceive or even imagine that will be revealed to me as I get further up that gradient, and then I’ll know what to do next. And I have tons of hope right now, because I think so many possibilities are opening up in terms of things we do next because of international enforcement.

Sarah Keohane Williamson is the Chief Executive Officer of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit research organization whose mission is to focus capital on the long term to support a sustainable and prosperous economy. Under her leadership, FCLTGlobal develops innovative, practical research and builds a global community of CEOs focused on solving long-term challenges across the investment value chain. She is the author of "The CEO’s Guide to the Investment Galaxy." Record levels of private capital and the recent and rapid rise of VC-funded unicorns suggest to some that public markets are a thing of the past, a holdover from the capitalism of yesteryear. Financial news of the past two decades is littered with stories of companies delaying IPOs and growing despite it — Meta, Uber, Airbnb and the like. Some still remain private, most notably Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If they can find success without going public, why should anyone else? Take the example of Klarna — a 20-year-old company — which recently had a successful IPO on the NYSE, with a nice pop on its first day. Why would a company like Klarna choose to go public? Public companies have to deal with public investors, follow specific rules on governance, and disclose extensive information. Klarna had no trouble accessing private capital in the past. Surely some of their original backers were looking for liquidity, but there is plenty of private liquidity around if that is all they need. Many companies have decided that the private markets are a better place to be. Over the last couple of decades, the number of listed companies and new IPOs in developed markets has dropped dramatically. The rigor and scrutiny of being publicly traded, and the perceived pressures that come with opening up the shareholder roll, are burdens many companies would prefer to avoid. So why go public? The answer is that there are great benefits to being a listed company in a deep, global market. While there are plenty of capital options besides going public, public markets help companies grow up. That discipline and credibility, as well as the opportunity for founders, employees, and investors to benefit from the value created, still make public markets the destination of choice. And while listings did indeed drop over the past 30 or so years, in that same timeframe, global public market capitalization rose to over $90 trillion, or about 112% of global GDP. Public markets aren’t dead — they’re just misunderstood. The idea that companies must choose between the quarterly spin cycle and the refuge of private markets is a myth. With the right strategy and the right investors, public companies still deliver superior long-term value. It’s true, public companies spend a lot of time on the quarter — hitting or missing targets, talking to the Street, etc. But the reality is that providing estimates of your next quarter’s earnings only encourages traders to make short-term bets and increases the volatility of your stock price. It’s a habit, not a requirement. The best companies recognize that such a myopic focus on the quarterly cycle is a distraction from building a great business. To avoid it, most companies don’t issue quarterly earnings guidance anymore; by 2024, only 21% of S&P 500 companies were still doing so, down from 36% in 2010. Public companies have plenty of opportunities to talk to the investment community. But “investors” are not a monolith, something many CEOs find out too late. They have different horizons and incentives; some are seeking durable returns over decades, while others are simply looking for alpha. This is not criticism. It’s reality. But evidence shows that an increase in short-term, transient investors is associated with cuts to long-term investments (R&D, marketing, etc.) in order to increase short-term earnings, leading to temporary boosts in equity valuations that reverse over time. While CEOs can’t bar investors from buying stock in the public markets, they can have an investor strategy that tries to attract the best long-term investors by understanding their time frames and incentives. Companies that find success in this regard employ several key tactics: they engage consistently with large shareholders throughout the year (rather than limiting interactions to AGM seasons). They deploy CEO and board-level leadership for key shareholder meetings and, importantly, align IR professional incentives with long-term shareholder success metrics rather than short-term sell-side ratings. This comprehensive approach reduces an emphasis on 90-day cycles, creates deeper shareholder support, and unlocks mutual value for both investors and public companies. To be sure, there are advantages to staying private for companies in certain circumstances. But public markets remain an unmatched source of capital, credibility, and the opportunity to scale. It’s time to stop viewing them as a necessary evil and instead as a strategic asset — as long as companies can navigate them with intent and with the right strategies in place. Public companies aren’t dying, but CEOs who don’t adapt their investor strategy will.

Title: How QUBT Stock Falls To $2?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/07/how-qubt-stock-falls-to-2/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T12:57:11Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), which develops quantum-compatible chips and photonic hardware for high-performance computing, AI, and cybersecurity, has surged an astonishing 3,000% over the past twelve months. What’s driving this? It’s been a perfect mix of hype and momentum. First, the broader enthusiasm surrounding quantum computing has captivated Wall Street. Second, the ongoing AI boom has investors grouping quantum names into that narrative, despite their technological differences. Third, Quantum Computing Inc. has made several strategic announcements and partnerships that have kept the excitement alive. The company has been carving out its niche in the quantum technology space, unveiling collaborations and projects that look impressive on paper. However, here’s the reality—quantum computing is indeed the future, but a future still years away from commercial viability. The company’s revenue remains negligible at just $263,000. Unsurprisingly, it’s burning through cash—with a net income margin of -29,054% and an operating cash flow margin of -7,180%. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than owning an individual stock like QUBT, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably beaten its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering over 91% cumulative returns since inception. Why? Because HQ Portfolio stocks as a group have offered stronger returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark, avoiding large drawdowns, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Also see – Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? We agree—quantum stocks are all about long-term potential—and we’ve written about the upside potential for stocks like RGTI ourselves. But have you considered the downside risks? Logically, there are numerous factors that could derail Quantum Computing Inc.’s growth story, and when sentiment turns, speculative stocks don’t just dip—they collapse. That’s not speculation; it’s history. Consider what happened to QUBT during past market downturns. During the 2022 inflation shock when the Fed rapidly raised interest rates, QUBT’s stock plummeted 93% from $9.62 to $0.67. Even in the 2020 Covid-19 crash, it fell 73% from $5.97 to $1.62. These weren’t mild corrections—they were near-total wipeouts. That’s the stark difference between speculative plays and companies with real, recurring cash flows. So, what’s the true downside risk for QUBT from current levels? If history repeats, the stock could fall 70–93%, dropping to a range between $2 and $7. Are you prepared for that? This isn’t fearmongering—it’s what actually occurred in both 2020 and 2022. The fundamentals remain largely unchanged: persistent cash burn, limited commercialization progress, ongoing dilution, and valuation driven mostly by hype rather than results. If that level of volatility is unsettling, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a blend of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices). Its quarterly rebalanced approach across large-, mid-, and small-cap names offers participation in rallies while providing downside protection, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. This analysis aims to make investors aware of the genuine downside risks associated with QUBT stock. The company’s financials are among the weakest in the public market—a revenue base below $300,000, negative margins over -29,000%, and a recent $750 million equity raise that heavily dilutes shareholders. When market sentiment turns, QUBT’s history shows it can fall hard–and fast. Investors here aren’t buying a profitable enterprise but are betting that quantum computing becomes commercially viable soon enough for QUBT to survive its cash burn, effectively deploy $750 million in new funds, and compete against tech giants with deeper pockets. The real question is whether you can handle the potential volatility if that optimistic scenario doesn’t unfold as planned.

Title: How ACHR Stock Rises 10x To $150?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) isn't just another aviation stock—it’s positioning itself at the epicenter of what could be the most transformative shift in urban transportation since the automobile. With six Midnight aircraft currently in production and three in final assembly across facilities in California and Georgia, the company is steadily progressing toward commercial launch as investors begin to recognize the magnitude of the opportunity. The numbers paint an early picture: a $6 billion order book, each Midnight air taxi valued at $5 million, and stock performance that has surged nearly 300% over the past year. But here’s the key—this $6 billion backlog represents only a fraction of the long-term potential. Think about the last time you were stuck in traffic, watching minutes slip away while you had somewhere important to be. Now imagine stepping out of your building, tapping your phone, and within minutes rising above it all—no congestion, no delays, just a direct route to your destination. This is no longer science fiction. The deep human desire to overcome the limits of ground-based travel is finally being met by eVTOL technology (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing). Once people experience their first air taxi ride, they won’t just see a new mode of transportation—they’ll see freedom from the frustrations that define modern commuting. Before we dive deeper, if you’re seeking upside potential with less volatility than holding a single stock like ACHR, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns above 91% since inception. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark, offering smoother performance as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? Several powerful trends are converging to create the foundation for massive expansion: Let’s examine what large-scale adoption could mean. If Archer reaches production of 2,000 aircraft per year—a feasible goal in a mature global market—that equates to $10 billion in annual revenue. Assuming a 30% cash profit margin, that’s $3 billion in annual profits. Using a 30x earnings multiple, this scenario implies a $90 billion valuation—ten times its current $9 billion market cap. This isn’t about replacing every car ride; it’s about dominating the premium mobility segment in dense urban centers where time savings justify higher costs. Think business travel, airport transfers, emergency response, and eventually, high-value daily commuting. A decade from now, we could see millions of air taxi rides operating worldwide. Just as Uber revolutionized ground transport by making it convenient and accessible, eVTOL services could redefine how people navigate cities. The total addressable market extends far beyond today’s transportation spending. Eliminating commute time unlocks productivity and lifestyle value that people are willing to pay a premium for. Business hubs, airports, and intercity connections all represent enormous revenue opportunities. Of course, this transformation is not without risk. Several factors could impede progress: As always, investing in a single company stock carries risk. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a blend of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns for investors. The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a flexible approach to capitalize on bullish markets while minimizing drawdowns, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Archer Aviation stands at the crossroads of technological readiness, market demand, and regulatory clarity. While its current valuation reflects early-stage risk, the potential upside is extraordinary. This isn’t just a new product launch—it could be the dawn of an entirely new transportation paradigm. For investors willing to embrace the calculated risks of emerging tech, Archer offers a rare opportunity to participate in what could be one of the decade’s defining growth stories. The question isn’t if urban air mobility will arrive—it’s whether Archer can execute well enough to capture a meaningful share of what could become a multi-trillion-dollar global market.

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The strain on the U.S. air traffic control system could be key to ending the government shutdown. Air traffic controllers are working an average of 60 hours a week without pay, the head of their union told Forbes, at a time when there’s already a severe shortage of air traffic controllers. While they are considered essential and must continue to work during a shutdown, absenteeism and attrition reportedly played a key role in President Donald Trump’s decision to end the shutdown in 2018-19. “In a job that’s already stressful, this shutdown has put way more stress on our controllers,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters Monday. AMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, leading shares of the chipmaker to soar 24% on Monday as the company seeks to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. AMD gave OpenAI the option to purchase up to 160 million shares, representing an estimated 10% stake in the firm. President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa recipients is expected to hit universities hard, adding to higher education’s woes amid research funding cuts and freezes and new student loan limits set to kick in next year. The Trump Administration is also proposing changing the rules of the visa lottery to favor older workers, which would make it harder for foreign students who graduate from U.S. universities to stay in the country for work. Shares of AppLovin tumbled Monday as the SEC launched a probe into alleged data-collection violations tied to targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. The mobile advertising company’s stock dropped 14% following reports of the investigation, erasing an estimated $8.65 billion in executive and top pre-IPO investor wealth, according to Forbes estimates. ChatGPT users will soon be able to connect to third-party apps, such as Spotify or Zillow, while using the chatbot, parent company OpenAI’s latest innovation as it competes in the race for AI dominance. CEO Sam Altman said Monday that users will be able to perform functions like creating a playlist in Spotify or searching for a specific style of home through Zillow. Illinois challenged the Trump Administration over its efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago over the weekend, joining California and Oregon in suing over troop deployments. The district judge who was assigned the case did not immediately block the deployment and set oral arguments for Thursday, though she did say that she was “very troubled by the lack of answers” from Justice Department attorneys, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the criminal conviction of former Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump told reporters that he would have to speak with the Justice Department before commenting on a possible pardon. “I haven’t heard the name in so long, I can say this—I’d have to take a look at it,” the president said Monday. The NHL’s ten highest-paid players are expected to bring in an estimated $167 million combined this season—8% more than last year’s record $156 million, as the league-wide outlook improves. Topping the list for the second year in a row is Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews, projected to rake in approximately $20.2 million this season from his playing contract as well as endorsements and other business endeavors. The Supreme Court began a new term Monday in which it is set to potentially rule on several key Trump Administration policies. The court will hear oral arguments next month on lawsuits challenging the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, and it will decide on whether Trump can fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. Located on 170 acres along a lake southwest of Dallas Fort Worth airport, the championship-length Halbert National is the latest creation by legendary golf designer Tom Fazio. David D. Halbert, a new Forbes 400 member who spent some $50 million to build the par 72 track, owns 100% of the course. There is no membership, and only Halbert’s friends and family can play the course. The total price of Halbert’s satisfaction will be upwards of $70 million once he’s built out a lodge and acquired neighboring lots. “I want it to be nicer than Augusta,” says Halbert. He can afford it. This is Halbert’s first year on the Forbes 400. In March the biotech he founded, Caris Life Sciences, went public, quickly surging to a market cap of $10.3 billion. He owns 44%, good for a net worth of $4.9 billion. WHY IT MATTERS Although it’s fairly uncommon, other billionaires have built private golf courses, including Warren Stephens (net worth: $3.5 billion), whose Alotian course in Little Rock, Arkansas, is another Fazio masterpiece. Kelcy Warren (net worth: $7.3 billion), of pipeline giant Energy Transfer, owns the Lajitas course on the Rio Grande in west Texas. Ted Turner ($2.8 billion) has a course on his 9,000-acre Nonami Ranch in Georgia.

Time Published: 2025-10-07T10:05:00Z

October 07, 2025 06:05 ET | Source: AXIL Brands, Inc. AXIL Brands, Inc. LOS ANGELES, Oct. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXIL Brands, Inc. (“AXIL” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: AXIL), an emerging global consumer products company for AXIL® hearing protection and enhancement products and Reviv3® hair and skin care products, announces its financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2025 (“1Q26”). Financial Highlights for the Quarter Ended August 31, 2025 Recent Business Highlights “Our first quarter results reflected a revenue mix more heavily weighted to the retail channel than any of our previous quarters. Initial shipment of our AXIL® hearing products to a new national membership-based retail chain was a key driver of this mix shift and helped our total revenue grow 17% year-over-year,” commented Jeff Toghraie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AXIL. “The combination of a slight increase in sales and marketing expenses to support this incremental offline retail business, combined with fiscal discipline in managing other corporate expenses, allowed us to demonstrate significant operating leverage in the quarter. Despite the $1 million in revenue growth – or 17% total revenue growth and 25% revenue growth from AXIL-branded hearing products only – in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined as a percentage of sales to 62% in the quarter from 73% in the prior year period. The result was an increase of $0.4 million in net income from a net loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to net income of $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and an increase of $600,000 in EBITDA on a year-over-year basis and a swing to positive EBITDA for the quarter. The combined effect of higher revenue, a greater wholesale mix, and expense control led to solid profitability and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. “Over the last 18 months, our strategic focus has been to diversify our revenue channel mix and develop a more stable and balanced mix of online sales via our own e-commerce website, offline retail, and international distribution. Historically, our e-commerce channel has accounted for an overwhelming majority of our revenue, but in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we saw clear signs that our strategy is working, and our financial results reflect this progress. An increased mix of wholesale retail revenue should continue to benefit the Company, as this channel offers greater profitability and operating leverage than our online e-commerce channel. While gross margins alone are slightly higher in the e-commerce channel than in the wholesale channel, our online sales also carry with it greater sales and marketing expenses and customer acquisition costs than the offline retail channel. “We continue to look for additional retail distribution channels for our advanced hearing enhancement and protection products. An increased retail presence, along with the benefits of our historical and current online marketing efforts, should help raise customer awareness and turn AXIL products into a sought-after hearing protection and enhancement brand on the market. “Along with a goal of increased retail presence, we will continue to innovate to deliver high-performance, ergonomic, and desirable products. Our product roadmap includes the introduction of numerous new products or next-generation products in the coming two to three quarters, beginning with the next generation GS Extreme 3.0 product that is set to launch in time for the holiday season. “Turning to the balance sheet, inventory increased appreciably, though that was expected given the increased product supply needed to service our wholesale segment and an initial purchase order from a new customer. We expect that to normalize over time. Cash at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $4.1 million, which we believe is sufficient for us to internally fund our strategy and growth objectives. “Lastly, I’d like to provide some insights on our hair and skin care segment that sells our flagship Reviv3® line of hair care products. While much of our resources over the last few years have been focused on growing the hearing protection segment, we see a pathway for the hair and skin care segment to become more than just a dormant or hidden asset for the Company. We have already made strategic leadership additions to that business segment and expect to further bolster the team with additional experienced leaders with proven success in the beauty industry. Our new relationship with Chatters, Canada’s premier salon chain, was established shortly after bringing on a new leader, indicating that leadership can make a meaningful impact. We are optimistic that making leadership additions to this segment will be accretive to the Company and deliver sustainable shareholder value, especially in the professional beauty channel. “We remain focused and disciplined in our execution as we strive for meaningful long-term growth across both of our product segments. We have built a strong foundation that supports sustainable growth and operational efficiencies and are encouraged by our first quarter results and the business trends seen thus far in fiscal 2026,” concluded Mr. Toghraie. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company calculates EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), and adjusting for income taxes, interest income or expense, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted for stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented as a percentage of revenue, which is calculated by dividing the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and management considers EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA important indicators in evaluating the Company’s business on a consistent basis across various periods for trend analyses. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable financial measure, net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP is included in a schedule to this press release. About AXIL Brands AXIL Brands (NYSE American: AXIL) is an emerging global consumer products company. The Company is a manufacturer and marketer of premium hearing enhancement and protection products, including ear plugs, earmuffs, and ear buds, under the AXIL® brand and premium hair and skincare products under its in-house Reviv3® brand - selling products in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and throughout Asia.

Title: Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/07/up-500-whats-happening-with-avgo-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T10:00:01Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has significantly exceeded the broader market performance this year, with a year-to-date increase of about 46% compared to the S&P 500’s 14%. This robust performance has been fueled by strong quarterly outcomes and the acquisition of a new custom AI-chip client. Despite this recent rise, the stock has shown considerable long-term growth, skyrocketing over 500% since early 2023. This remarkable long-term increase is primarily due to two crucial factors: We will explore the details of these factors and the company’s valuation in the sections that follow. Nevertheless, if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns surpassing 91% since its launch. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it was less of a turbulent experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The market reassessed Broadcom from a traditional semiconductor company to an AI infrastructure growth entity. The company secured significant agreements, including a $10 billion deal with OpenAI, establishing it as a vital supplier of custom AI accelerators to hyperscalers. AI revenue has expanded for eleven consecutive quarters, with Q3 2025 AI revenue skyrocketing 63% year-over-year to $5.2 billion. This evolution from a legacy chip manufacturer to an essential AI infrastructure supplier warranted a notable valuation premium, elevating the P/E from 14 to 54. Our dashboard on Broadcom’s Valuation Ratiosprovides additional insights on Broadcom’s other valuation multiples. Two primary factors propelled the near doubling of adjusted net income: The 15% rise in outstanding shares is directly attributed to the financing of the VMware acquisition. Broadcom offered VMware shareholders merger consideration in cash and stock, issuing new shares as part of the $69 billion transaction. This dilution was the cost of swiftly expanding the business through acquisition instead of solely relying on organic growth. Currently trading around $340 per share following the recent market fluctuations, Broadcom’s valuation reflects both the opportunities and challenges inherent in its business model. The stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 54x based on trailing adjusted earnings represents a premium in comparison to traditional semiconductor companies and is notably higher than the stock’s own average of 30x over the past three years. Nonetheless, this valuation premium seems warranted given the company’s strong AI exposure and ongoing software transformation. With an average analyst price target of $370, AVGO stock still appears to have potential for growth. That said, our assessment may not be accurate, and investors might not be inclined to pay such a high multiple for AVGO, considering its intrinsic risks. Primary risks include customer concentration, cyclical semiconductor demand, and competitive pressures in the AI chip sector. Investors should carefully evaluate all these risks before purchasing AVGO stock. Additionally, see how AVGO stock’s valuation compares to that of its peers. Therefore, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly re-balanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: OpenAI’s Windows Play

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: OpenAI’s flood of announcements are getting hard to keep up with. A selection — not exhaustive! — from just the last month: The last two announcements just dropped yesterday, and actually bring clarity and coherence to the entire list. In short, OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. For nearly two decades smartphones, and in particular iOS, have been the touchstones in terms of discussing platforms. It’s important to note, however, that while Apple’s strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely profitable, it entailed leaving the door open for a competing platform to emerge. The challenge of being a hardware company is that by virtue of needing to actually create devices you can’t serve everyone; Apple in particular didn’t have the capacity or desire to go downmarket, which created the opportunity for Android to not only establish a competing platform but to actually significantly exceed iOS in market share. That means that if we want a historical analogy for total platform dominance — which increasingly appears to be OpenAI’s goal — we have to go back further to the PC era and Windows. Before there was Windows there was DOS; before DOS, however, there was a fast-talking deal-making entrepreneur named Bill Gates. From The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac: In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS, which they acquired from another company — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft. The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless. There is nothing like IBM and its dominant position in enterprise today; rather, the route to becoming a platform is to first be a massively popular product. Acquiring developers and users is not a chicken-and-egg problem: it is clear that you must get users first, which attracts developers, enhancing your platform in a virtuous cycle; to put it another way, first a product must Aggregate users and then it gets developers for free. ChatGPT is exactly that sort of product, and at yesterday’s DevDay 2025 keynote CEO Sam Altman and team demonstrated exactly that sort of pull; from The Verge: OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. The idea is that, from within a conversation with the chatbot, you can essentially tag in apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map — which the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. It’s fair to wonder if these app experiences will measure up to these company’s self-built apps or websites, just as there are questions about just how well the company’s Instant Checkout will convert; what is notable, however, is that I disagree that this represents a “push to integrate…with the rest of the web”. This is the opposite: this is a push to make ChatGPT the operating system of the future. Apps won’t be on your phone or in a browser; they’ll be in ChatGPT, and if they aren’t, they simply will not exist for ChatGPT users. That, by extension, means the burden of making these integrations work — and those conversions performant — will be on third party developers, not OpenAI. This is the power that comes from owning users, and OpenAI is flexing that power in a major way. There is a second aspect to the IBM PC strategy, and that is the role of AMD. From a 2024 Update: While IBM chose Intel to provide the PC’s processor, they were wary of being reliant on a single supplier (it’s notable that IBM didn’t demand the same of the operating system, which was probably a combination of not fully appreciating operating systems as a point of integration and lock-in for 3rd-party software, which barely existed at that point, and a recognition that software is just bits and not a physical good that has to be manufactured). To that end IBM demanded that Intel license its processor to another chip firm, and AMD was the obvious choice: the firm was founded by Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor alum who had worked with Intel’s founders, and specialized in manufacturing licensed chips. The relationship between Intel and AMD ended up being incredibly fraught and largely documented by endless lawsuits (you can read a brief history in that Update); the key point to understand, however, is that (1) IBM wanted to have dual suppliers to avoid being captive to an essential component provider and (2) IBM had the power to make that happen because they had the customers who were going to provide Intel so much volume. The true beneficiary of IBM’s foresight, of course, was Microsoft, which controlled the operating system; IBM’s mandate is why it is appropriate that “Windows” comes first in the “Wintel” characterization of the PC era. Intel reaped tremendous profits from its position in the PC value chain, but more value accrued to Microsoft than anyone else. This question of who will capture the most profit from the AI value chain remains an open one. There’s no question that the early winner is Nvidia: the company has become the most valuable in the world by virtue of its combination of best-in-class GPUs, superior networking, and CUDA software layer that locks people into Nvidia’s own platform. And, as long as power is the limiting factor, Nvidia is well-placed to maintain its position. What Nvidia is not shy about is capturing its share of value, and that is a powerful incentive for other companies in the value chain to look for alternatives. Google is the furthest along in this regard thanks to its decade-old investment in TPUs, while Amazon is seeking to mimic their strategy with Trainium; Microsoft and Meta are both working to design and build their own chips, and Apple is upscaling Apple Silicon for use in the data center. Once again, however, the most obvious and most immediately available alternative to Nvidia is AMD, and I think the parallels between yesterday’s announcement of an OpenAI-AMD deal and IBM’s strong-arming of Intel are very clear; from the Wall Street Journal: OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that will run on AMD processors, one of the most direct challenges yet to industry leader Nvidia. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, starting with the MI450 chip next year. The ChatGPT maker will buy the chips either directly or through its cloud computing partners. AMD chief Lisa Su said in an interview Sunday that the deal would result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade. The two companies didn’t disclose the plan’s expected overall cost, but AMD said it costs tens of billions of dollars per gigawatt of computing capacity. OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the chip company, at 1 cent per share, awarded in phases, if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD’s stock price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. If OpenAI is the software layer that matters to the ecosystem, then Nvidia’s long-term pricing power will be diminished; the company, like Intel, may still take the lion’s share of chip profits through sheer performance and low-level lock-in, but I believe the most important reason OpenAI is making this deal is to lock in its own dominant position in the stack. It is pretty notable that this announcement comes only weeks after Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI; that, though, is another affirmation that the company who has the users has the ultimate power. There is one other part of the stack to keep an eye on: TSMC. Both Nvidia and AMD make their chips with the Taiwanese giant, and while TSMC is famously reticent to take price, they are positioned to do so in the long run. Altman surely knows this as well, which means that I wouldn’t be surprised if there is an Intel announcement sooner rather than later; maybe there is fire to that recent smoke about AMD talking with Intel? When I started writing Stratechery, Windows was a platform in decline, superceded by mobile and, surprisingly enough, increasingly challenged by its all-but-vanquished ancient foe, the Mac. To that end, one of my first pieces about Microsoft was about then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s misguided attempt to focus on devices instead of services. I wrote a few years later in Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover: The truth is that both [IBM and Microsoft] were victims of their own monopolistic success: Windows, like the System/360 before it, was a platform that enabled Microsoft to make money in all directions. Both companies made money on the device itself and by selling many of the most important apps (and in the case of Microsoft, back-room services) that ran on it. There was no need to distinguish between a vertical strategy, in which apps and services served to differentiate the device, or a horizontal one, in which the device served to provide access to apps and services. When you are a monopoly, the answer to strategic choices can always be “Yes.” Microsoft at that point in time no longer had that luxury: the company needed to make a choice — the days of doing everything were over — and that choice should be services (which is exactly what Satya Nadella did). Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT made OpenAI The Accidental Consumer Tech Company I have been making similar arguments about OpenAI: they need to focus on the consumer opportunity and leave the enterprise API market to Microsoft. Not only would focus help the company capture the consumer opportunity, there was the opportunity cost of GPUs used for the API that couldn’t be used to deliver consumers a better experience across every tier. I now have much more appreciation for OpenAI’s insistence on doing it all, for two reasons. First, this is a company in pure growth mode, not in decline. Tradeoffs are in the long run inevitable, but why make them before you need to? It would have been a mistake for Microsoft to restrict Windows to only the enterprise in the 1980s, even if the company had to low-key retreat from the consumer market over the last fifteen years; there was a lot of money to make before that retreat needed to happen! OpenAI, meanwhile, is the hottest brand in AI, so why not make a play to own it all, from consumer touchpoint to API to everything in-between? Second, we’ve obviously crossed the line into bubble territory, which always was inevitable. The question now is whether or not this is a productive bubble: what durable infrastructure will be built by eventually bankrupt companies that we benefit from for years to come? GPUs are not that durable infrastructure; data centers are more long-lasting, but not worth the financial pain of a bubble burst. The real payoff would be a massive build-out in power generation, which would be a benefit for the next half a century. Another potential payoff would be the renewed viability of Intel, and as I noted above, OpenAI may be uniquely positioned and motivated to make that happen. More broadly, this play to be the Windows of AI effectively positions OpenAI as the linchpin of the entire AI buildout. Just look at what the mere announcement of partnerships with OpenAI has done for the stocks of Oracle and AMD. OpenAI is creating the conditions such that it is the primary manifestation of the AI bubble, which ensures the company is the primary beneficiary of all of the speculative capital flooding into the space. Were the company more focused, as I have previously advised, they may not have the leverage to get enough funding to meet those more modest (but still incredible) goals; now it’s hard to see them not getting whatever money they want, at least until the bubble bursts. What’s amazing about this overview is that I only scratched the surface of what OpenAI announced both yesterday and over the last month — and I haven’t even mentioned Sora (although I covered that topic yesterday). What the company is seeking to achieve is incredibly audacious, but also logical, and something we’ve seen before: And, interestingly enough, there is an Apple to OpenAI’s Microsoft: it’s Google, with their fully integrated stack, from chips to data centers to models to end user distribution channels. Instead of taking on a menagerie of competitors, however, Google is facing an increasingly unified ecosystem, organized, whether they wish to be or not, around OpenAI. Such is the power of aggregating demand and the phenomenon that is ChatGPT. Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: OpenAI’s flood of announcements are getting hard to keep up with. A selection — not exhaustive! — from just the last month: The last two announcements just dropped yesterday, and actually bring clarity and coherence to the entire list. In short, OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. For nearly two decades smartphones, and in particular iOS, have been the touchstones in terms of discussing platforms. It’s important to note, however, that while Apple’s strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely profitable, it entailed leaving the door open for a competing platform to emerge. The challenge of being a hardware company is that by virtue of needing to actually create devices you can’t serve everyone; Apple in particular didn’t have the capacity or desire to go downmarket, which created the opportunity for Android to not only establish a competing platform but to actually significantly exceed iOS in market share. That means that if we want a historical analogy for total platform dominance — which increasingly appears to be OpenAI’s goal — we have to go back further to the PC era and Windows. Before there was Windows there was DOS; before DOS, however, there was a fast-talking deal-making entrepreneur named Bill Gates. From The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac: In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS, which they acquired from another company — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft. The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless. There is nothing like IBM and its dominant position in enterprise today; rather, the route to becoming a platform is to first be a massively popular product. Acquiring developers and users is not a chicken-and-egg problem: it is clear that you must get users first, which attracts developers, enhancing your platform in a virtuous cycle; to put it another way, first a product must Aggregate users and then it gets developers for free. ChatGPT is exactly that sort of product, and at yesterday’s DevDay 2025 keynote CEO Sam Altman and team demonstrated exactly that sort of pull; from The Verge: OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. The idea is that, from within a conversation with the chatbot, you can essentially tag in apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map — which the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. It’s fair to wonder if these app experiences will measure up to these company’s self-built apps or websites, just as there are questions about just how well the company’s Instant Checkout will convert; what is notable, however, is that I disagree that this represents a “push to integrate…with the rest of the web”.

The relationship between Intel and AMD ended up being incredibly fraught and largely documented by endless lawsuits (you can read a brief history in that Update); the key point to understand, however, is that (1) IBM wanted to have dual suppliers to avoid being captive to an essential component provider and (2) IBM had the power to make that happen because they had the customers who were going to provide Intel so much volume. The true beneficiary of IBM’s foresight, of course, was Microsoft, which controlled the operating system; IBM’s mandate is why it is appropriate that “Windows” comes first in the “Wintel” characterization of the PC era.

Both companies made money on the device itself and by selling many of the most important apps (and in the case of Microsoft, back-room services) that ran on it. There was no need to distinguish between a vertical strategy, in which apps and services served to differentiate the device, or a horizontal one, in which the device served to provide access to apps and services. When you are a monopoly, the answer to strategic choices can always be “Yes.” Microsoft at that point in time no longer had that luxury: the company needed to make a choice — the days of doing everything were over — and that choice should be services (which is exactly what Satya Nadella did). Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT made OpenAI The Accidental Consumer Tech Company I have been making similar arguments about OpenAI: they need to focus on the consumer opportunity and leave the enterprise API market to Microsoft. Not only would focus help the company capture the consumer opportunity, there was the opportunity cost of GPUs used for the API that couldn’t be used to deliver consumers a better experience across every tier. I now have much more appreciation for OpenAI’s insistence on doing it all, for two reasons. First, this is a company in pure growth mode, not in decline. Tradeoffs are in the long run inevitable, but why make them before you need to? It would have been a mistake for Microsoft to restrict Windows to only the enterprise in the 1980s, even if the company had to low-key retreat from the consumer market over the last fifteen years; there was a lot of money to make before that retreat needed to happen! OpenAI, meanwhile, is the hottest brand in AI, so why not make a play to own it all, from consumer touchpoint to API to everything in-between? Second, we’ve obviously crossed the line into bubble territory, which always was inevitable. The question now is whether or not this is a productive bubble: what durable infrastructure will be built by eventually bankrupt companies that we benefit from for years to come? GPUs are not that durable infrastructure; data centers are more long-lasting, but not worth the financial pain of a bubble burst. The real payoff would be a massive build-out in power generation, which would be a benefit for the next half a century. Another potential payoff would be the renewed viability of Intel, and as I noted above, OpenAI may be uniquely positioned and motivated to make that happen. More broadly, this play to be the Windows of AI effectively positions OpenAI as the linchpin of the entire AI buildout. Just look at what the mere announcement of partnerships with OpenAI has done for the stocks of Oracle and AMD. OpenAI is creating the conditions such that it is the primary manifestation of the AI bubble, which ensures the company is the primary beneficiary of all of the speculative capital flooding into the space. Were the company more focused, as I have previously advised, they may not have the leverage to get enough funding to meet those more modest (but still incredible) goals; now it’s hard to see them not getting whatever money they want, at least until the bubble bursts. What’s amazing about this overview is that I only scratched the surface of what OpenAI announced both yesterday and over the last month — and I haven’t even mentioned Sora (although I covered that topic yesterday). What the company is seeking to achieve is incredibly audacious, but also logical, and something we’ve seen before: And, interestingly enough, there is an Apple to OpenAI’s Microsoft: it’s Google, with their fully integrated stack, from chips to data centers to models to end user distribution channels. Instead of taking on a menagerie of competitors, however, Google is facing an increasingly unified ecosystem, organized, whether they wish to be or not, around OpenAI. Such is the power of aggregating demand and the phenomenon that is ChatGPT. Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Title: The commotion has begun, Alexis is founding a party (or something Macron-style), who his key figures are and who’s fuming, the Saudi minister’s meetings, the stockbroker with the Porsche

Hello there. Now, you’ll say… “you’re like a broken record, you’ve been saying the same things will happen this winter.” What can I do? I’ll say it again: the best is yet to come. And it all started yesterday with Alexis Tsipras announcing his departure from SYRIZA, heading “for new seas,” as he put it — which, translated, means a new party. Or something like that, since lately I’ve been hearing talk of an “electoral alliance of personalities,” Macron-style, though I’m not entirely convinced. I tried teasing my first-class source in the political world by saying “does this ‘new seas’ line hint at…?” But they laughed and replied, “Stop the provocations. Alexis is addressing his old comrades — we’ve been through this. We’re not joining forces with businessmen; no offense, but we’ll keep our independence.” Reactions… Let’s be honest: our leader, the great helmsman Alexis, never goes unnoticed. I’m probably the only one who didn’t issue a statement to attack him. Of course, New Democracy did, PASOK did — and its various warlords individually — as did all the former comrades, who accuse him of causing a split. As if the original “First Time Left” (SYRIZA) hadn’t already fragmented into ten pieces — it’s Tsipras making one more that bothers them. The only one who remained gracious (by nature, anyway) was also the most directly affected: Sokratis Famellos, whose party Tsipras just left. He almost apologized to Tsipras — the man who left SYRIZA! The sauerkraut and the oracle of a new party Let me remind you that last week Tsipras, still as an MP, participated in the work of the Council of Europe. The mixed parliamentary delegation posted a “family photo” from a dinner held at the ambassador’s residence. In the picture, the former PM was surrounded by Dora Bakoyannis, Theodoros Roussopoulos, George Papandreou, Evripidis Stylianidis, Yiannis Oikonomou, Dimitris Markopoulos, Giorgos Stamatis, Dimitris Mantzos and Nefeli Chatziioannidou. I asked some of those present whether — between the tarte aux oignons (onion tart), choucroute garnie (sauerkraut with cured meats), and fine, fruity Alsatian Gewürztraminer — he confided anything about his intentions. The answer was no. They did say, however, that he seemed generally disenchanted with SYRIZA. But they passed on one comment of his that I found revealing. When asked whether he plans to found a party, he said: “A former prime minister starts a party only to become prime minister again.” Why now… Readers ask why he rushed to leave now — does it mean the party launch is coming earlier than the new year? The answer I got was: “He didn’t want to attend Parliament’s opening blessing ceremony as a SYRIZA MP.” Personally, I believe he also wants to be “set up” early, because founding a new party — especially on the Left — is no easy task. (Not that the Right is overflowing with talent either…) The reservoirs… Several opinion polls are currently measuring the potential impact of new parties in formation. In Tsipras’s case, one recent poll found that over 19% of respondents were either certain or inclined to vote for him (8% were solid). Where would Tsipras’s support come from? Roughly, two-thirds of SYRIZA’s 2024 European election voters, 40% of the New Left voters, 19+% from Plefsi Eleftherias (Course of Freedom), 13% from KKE (Communist Party) and almost 10% from PASOK. Of course, polls are one thing, ballot boxes another… The people of Amalias Street… Tsipras is said to be conducting a thorough screening of potential figures to join his new party. He’s reportedly not eager to rely on current SYRIZA MPs as a base. Later on, when it’s time to compile electoral lists, he will likely include some — under conditions. At his offices on Amalias Avenue, a core team of close associates is in constant contact with him. They include: Michalis Kalogirou (longtime director), Vangelis Kalpadakis (splits his time between Athens and Vienna), Giorgos Chouliarakis and Dimitris Liakos (economic team), Giorgos Vasiliadis (in charge of scouting people). What Maximos Mansion is saying “This is an opportunity for people to remember who Tsipras is, but for us, he’s not the benchmark,” a source from the Maximos Mansion (Prime Minister’s Office) told me about Tsipras’s new venture. Government spokesperson Marinakis reportedly made a jab at Tsipras’s “new seas” phrase, saying “last time, we needed life vests” — but that’s not their official strategy. Obviously, Maximos isn’t going to pretend he doesn’t exist. They’ll keep reminding voters of his record. But based on their research, they believe they shouldn’t revive the Mitsotakis–Tsipras two-party dynamic — that was settled for many voters in the 2023 elections, apart from perhaps ND’s hardcore base. Meeting on special spatial planning Meanwhile, meetings upon meetings are held daily at Maximos on various central issues. Following yesterday’s meeting on water — focusing on urgent interventions needed to prevent Attica from running out in 1.5 years — today’s discussion will concern special spatial plans. Participants include K.M., Hatzidakis, Papastavrou-Tagaras from the Environment Ministry. The goal is to finalize special spatial plans for renewable energy and tourism by year’s end, though significant pending issues remain for industry, mineral resources, aquaculture, and more. The Saudi Arabian Minister’s Visits and Meetings Since yesterday, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al-Khorayef, has been in Greece. He met with Theodorikakos and Papastavrou, while the Minister of Development took him in the afternoon to the Elefsina Shipyards, as Greece is interested in bringing the Saudis into the equation and securing orders for the shipyard. Particularly noteworthy is the breakfast that Theodorikakos is organizing for him today with representatives of the largest Greek companies from the industrial, energy, construction, and other sectors. The Saudi minister controls several hundred billion, so it’s best not to miss these kinds of opportunities… Petralias’s “Glass” Yesterday, after the conclusion of the statements regarding the submission of the draft Budget, Pierr (likely referring to the Finance Minister) smilingly said in a small informal press chat about Petralias:“Some see the glass half full, some half empty. Thanos sees it twice as big,” acknowledging the role of the Deputy Minister, who shapes the final form of economic policy. Let’s not forget, after all, that Pierrakakis and Petralias are the “architects” both of the rent rebate announced at Easter and to be implemented in November, and of the Thessaloniki International Fair measures aimed at supporting the middle class and addressing the demographic issue. Negotiations for Two Organic Product Companies Leaving aside the concerns the French situation is causing in the markets, let’s turn to the microcosm of the Greek market, starting with the increased activity surrounding organic product companies. According to market sources, two separate negotiation cases are underway involving two different funds. Neither deal is guaranteed to close, though the one that seems more advanced is Bioagros’s talks with Halcyon Capital, currently at the due diligence stage — which means nothing is finalized yet.On a related note about food, I hear it’s only a matter of days before the acquisition of Kritikos by Masoutis is formally concluded. Euronext’s Plan for the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX) Interesting details emerge from the information memorandum regarding Euronext’s public offer for the Athens Stock Exchange. The memorandum has been published, and any investor visiting Euronext’s website section dedicated to the public offer will experience a kind of “cultural shock” at how direct and clear the information is: it lays out the key facts shareholders need to know, provides step-by-step acceptance instructions, an FAQ section, and more. Now to the essence: Euronext’s plan for the Athens Exchange is to integrate it into its platform and turn it into a hub for company listings from the broader Southeastern European region, under the name “Euronext Athens.” A key role is played by its technological infrastructure — specifically, Euronext’s unified trading, clearing, and post-trading platform — which is planned to be incorporated into the Greek exchange. Euronext expects to achieve annual cash synergies (run rate) of €12 million by the end of 2028, mainly through migrating the Greek trading market to the Optiq platform and harmonizing core functions. The transition of ATHEX’s systems to the unified platform is planned for 2027. Additionally: The CEO of ATHEX will be proposed as a member of the Board of Directors of Euronext N.V. An independent representative of the Greek financial ecosystem will be proposed to join the Euronext Supervisory Board at the 2026 Annual General Meeting. The Hellenic Capital Market Commission will remain the main supervisory authority for Greek markets and will be invited to join Euronext’s College of Supervisors, participating in the overall supervision of the Euronext Group. Key Points of the Public Offer The acceptance period will last six weeks, until November 17. The exchange ratio is twenty ATHEX shares for one Euronext share. Based on the timetable, and provided there are no changes, the new shares to be issued (the exchange shares) will start trading on Euronext markets on November 24. The total number of exchange shares issued will depend on how many ATHEX shares are finally tendered in the public offer or, if applicable, acquired through the squeeze-out and sell-out rights should the process reach that stage. The information memorandum states that G. Chatzinikolaou and G. Kontopoulos have committed to tender their shares (15,000 and 95,000 respectively). Formally, the offer will be valid if shareholders holding at least 38.76 million shares, or 67% of ATHEX’s total shares, accept it. However, Euronext can consider the offer successful even with 33%, since it has the right, e.g., five days before the end of the offer, to lower the required threshold. An important factor in the public offer is that as of the end of June, ATHEX itself held 2.5 million treasury shares, corresponding to 4.14% of its share capital. Deutsche Bank is acting as Euronext’s advisor, and Eurobank is the offer’s manager. In the banking brokerages…they’ve seen it all The above concerns are essentially about the public offer but refer to the official framework for how Euronext will proceed. What is more interesting, however, is what is happening behind the scenes, with the Dark Room offering mental support especially to the staff of the banking brokerage firms… who have seen it all. What preparations they are making, what methods they are inventing so that their clients can easily open foreign accounts in order to receive the Euronext shares, what informational and other types of emails they are sending, etc. etc. In the banking mutual fund management companies (AEDAK), I imagine there will not be similar mobilization, as only one decision is needed, but the pressure there is also strongly felt. From the side of those who support Euronext’s move, the estimates regarding the outcome of the offer are that it is not considered a done deal, but if the bar is lowered to 51%, it has good chances. On the opposite side, the… unruly ones disagree due to the large participation of private investors in the Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) shareholding structure, and argue that the offer will struggle to gather 50%. Who is right will be revealed on November 17 (note: what a day they picked, too!). The two shipowners who support the Chinese shipyards Despite Washington’s intense pressure to impose duties on Chinese-built ships docking at American ports, China continues to hold the lead. More than 50% of new global ship orders are directed to Chinese shipyards. This percentage soared during the summer months of 2025: 65% in June and 84% in August. Despite US–China tensions, China’s shipbuilding industry is being supported by new orders from major shipowners, such as George Procopiou and the Norwegian John Fredriksen. G.P.’s Dynacom owns the largest tanker fleet on order in the world, with 55 tankers under construction. If the orders from other companies in the group — bulkers and gas carriers — are added, the total number of ships under construction reaches 83. The (double) vote of the chairman And since the subject came up, let me add that G. Procopiou leaves nothing to chance. This is also confirmed by a very recent amendment to the Articles of Association of “Astir Palace M.A.X.E.”, which owns the Astir Vouliagmeni complex. It should be noted that this complex passed into the hands of G. Procopiou at the beginning of the year, with him taking over as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Last week, the amendment of Article 25 of Astir Palace’s Articles of Association was uploaded to the General Commercial Registry (G.E.MI.). This article sets out the provisions regarding member representation, quorum, and majority for the operation of the Board of Directors. According to the Articles of Association, “the company is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of 3 to 15 directors,” while currently the members are 5: G. Procopiou (Chairman), D. Lampropoulos (Vice Chairman), H. Pavlou (CEO), P. Kassi­dokostas–Latsis (Member), and K. Mitsios (Member). Article 25, which regulates issues of majority, previously provided that “the decisions of the Board of Directors are validly taken by an absolute majority of the directors who are present and those represented.” With the said amendment, however, it was added that “in the event of a tie, the Chairman’s vote prevails.” It is self-evident that the opinion of the owner and Chairman carries decisive weight, but in this case, this “advantage” was also enshrined in the Articles of Association. Greece at the critical IMF Summit The submission of the 2026 Draft Budget will be the strong card of the Greek government delegation, which, a week from today, will travel to Washington for the IMF and World Bank Annual Fall Meetings. Strong growth rates, fiscal discipline, a spectacular reduction of Public Debt, and reforms will be the key arguments of Finance Minister K. Pierrakakis, Michalis Argyrou (head of the Prime Minister’s Economic Office), and Dimitris Tsakonas of the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA). At a time when Sovereign Debts have skyrocketed to record levels and two-thirds of the discussions in Washington concern their management, the Greek side will be a useful, positive example. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable has announced it will publish a “playbook” for more predictable and faster sovereign debt restructuring procedures, combined with institutional reforms on the role of international financial institutions in supporting countries’ recovery. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will deliver her key speech on October 8 at the Milken Institute, while the official Plenary Session will be held on October 17. The stockbroker with the blue Porsche who gives advice via TikTok Times have changed. The Stock Exchange is no longer a taboo. Social media have firmly entered our lives. This is exactly what Mr. Socrates Ch. of Platon seems to believe, who travels with his blue Porsche between Monaco and Luxembourg, and incidentally also gives investment advice. With humor, ease, and confidence, he declares on TikTok which stocks will perform well, what are “the games of the market” at the moment, and he shares — for free, of course — his knowledge with the audience that follows him. In his most recent analysis, he mentioned “the surprise of ELTON Chemicals” as a “hidden card,” which, however, did not work out for him yesterday — just like ONYX — but there is always time for improvement. Drop with low turnover and a pretext from France It didn’t have the strength to reach higher levels, it didn’t have the mood for a major correction, but it found a “golden pretext” in the developments of French political life, which certainly affect the entire Eurozone, to stop and take a breather. The positive start of the General Index lasted only 10 minutes; it didn’t continue, since the European Stock Exchanges started “in the red” as soon as the resignation of the French prime minister was announced. But when the European markets limited their losses, Athens continued downwards, mainly because it didn’t feel like putting up any resistance. The General Index started at 2,082.37 points (+0.30%) and then dropped to 2,049.59 points (–1.31%). It ended the session at 2,053.08 points (–1.14%). The value of transactions remained at €188.2 million, of which €22.08 million were in blocks, because most transactions took place in “heavyweight” stocks. Worth noting is the move by Coca Cola HBC (+0.52% at €38.5), which after a long time contributed positively to the General Index with trades worth €4.45 million. With transactions worth €28.9 million, Piraeus fell to €7.26 (–2.76%) after the announcement of a €600 million AT1 bond issue, convertible into shares. National Bank (–1.25% at €13.07), Alpha (–1.33% at €3.70), and Eurobank (–0.97% at €3.482) reflect the climate of yesterday’s session, affecting the rest of the banking stocks as well. Intralot (€1.178, –4.23%), after the success of its public offering, rushed to meet the capital increase price (€1.11). The autonomous course of Viohalco’s shares The shares of the Viohalco Group kept their distance from the nervousness and the generally poor picture presented yesterday by the Greek stock market. With the majority of stocks “in the red,” Viohalco, ElvalHalcor, and Cenergy Holdings were bright exceptions, continuing their trajectory at levels of historic or multi-year highs. VIO took a decisive step toward conquering €8 for the first time, with its capitalization now exceeding €2 billion. Over the last three days, it has “run” a rally of 7.1%, and this year it has strengthened by 46.5%. A buying party took place in ELHA, which was the blue chip with the strongest rise. With a 4.4% jump, it closed at €3.06, reaching €3.08 at the day’s highs. This is the best close in more than 17 years, specifically since early January 2008. CENER followed with a smaller rise, but it was enough not only to renew its all-time high but also to reach the peak of €13. Over the last five days, it has seen only positive signs, posting cumulative gains of around 8.65%. Its market capitalization stands at €2.77 billion, trailing Titan (€2.86 billion) and Motor Oil (€2.88 billion). The shipowners renovate After many years, the Union of Greek Shipowners is proceeding with a substantial renovation of its privately owned offices in Piraeus. Works are underway for a complete refurbishment, with the goal of being ready before the celebration of world shipping — Posidonia — next June. The modernization of the offices includes everything from infrastructure and energy upgrades to the creation of modern, technologically updated workspaces. Until the works are completed, the UGS has moved its services to other offices on Akti Miaouli. Geneva calling In the glamorous Bâtiment des Forces Motrices hall in Geneva, Kriton Lentoudis of Evalend Shipping was honored as “Shipowner of the Year.” Upon receiving his award, he called on the Greek shipping community to stand “on par with other maritime centers” and to more actively support the work of Mercy Ships — the hospital ships that provide surgical care in poor African countries. Every AI deal sends stocks soaring Late the night before last, New York time, it was announced that OpenAI — the company that brought ChatGPT into our lives — will acquire 10% of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and will develop up to 6 GW of AMD Instinct graphics processors, starting with 1 GigaWatt in 2026. To get a sense of the scale, 1 GigaWatt is enough to power hundreds of thousands of advanced computers simultaneously. This infrastructure is necessary for training the next generations of artificial intelligence. Immediately after the announcement, AMD’s share price skyrocketed by +25%, from $165 to $207.35 in a single session. OpenAI will participate as an early design partner in the development of AMD’s next GPU, the MI450. This move breaks Nvidia’s monopoly in the AI processor market. Nvidia had dominated with over 90% market share in AI chips, but AMD — now supported by OpenAI — becomes a serious competitor. The war has just begun. Hydrogen is changing the construction sector in Britain It is the first attempt. It didn’t take place in a scientific laboratory, but on a real construction site. And it changes all the cost parameters. A huge excavator, a JCB machine, will run not on diesel but on hydrogen. It has already started work at the Lower Thames Crossing — a £10 billion project connecting Kent with Essex. It marks a silent revolution in the construction sector. The excavator is already saving 1.1 tons of CO₂ per month. In Britain, plans are already being developed to completely eliminate oil from construction sites by 2027. The construction industry represents 39% of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, with heavy vehicles and machinery consuming vast amounts of diesel. The Lower Thames Crossing serves as a testing ground for a new, “green” way of building: low-emission steel, improved concrete methods, and the largest supply of green hydrogen ever made in the UK. Experience so far shows that hydrogen can indeed power heavy equipment under real-world conditions. If the model succeeds, Europe will have a real blueprint for how to build infrastructure without burning its future. Explore related questions

Title: The Autistic Half-Century
URL: https://www.thediff.co/archive/the-autistic-half-century/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In this issue: 2025 has been a good year for valedictory memoirs from some of the 20th century's great executives, like Bill Gates' Source Code and John Malone's Born to be Wired. Gates has a few cameos in Malone's book, as a business partner and investor. One reason the two of them got along pretty well is that they had something in common: each one notes, early in his memoir, that he's autistic, and that his life (and his parents'!) would have been easier if he'd known that earlier. When people talk about "autism," they're describing a wide spectrum of outcomes, including pretty serious disabilities that prevent severely autistic people from living on their own. When they use the term to describe themselves, they're referring to the more benign part—a combination of poor social skills, odd sensitivities (to food, texture, noise, etc.), and the ability-or-compulsion to focus for long periods on very narrow domains.[1] For the purpose of this piece, by "autistic" I'm generally referring to the part of the spectrum where people can hold down jobs and live independently, and not the more severe varieties. This used to be called Aspergers, but that incredibly useful, motte-and-baily-crushing distinction has been deprecated for some reason. This set of traits has existed for a long time; Heraclides of Pontus describes the maritime equivalent of being obsessed with trains in the 4th century BC. Isaac Newton was a vividly weird guy who spent more time on biblical and alchemical studies than on math and physics. (He was also a very literal, subtext-insensitive kind of person; he got a sinecure as Master of the Mint partly because the government wanted to reward him for his academic contributions, but insisted on actually doing the job, hunting down counterfeiters, etc.) One reason to suspect that many public figures have an autistic streak is a two-sided selection effect: they're more often in circumstances where it's natural and normal for them to do what would otherwise be autistic. Describe Warren Buffett as someone who periodically has six-hour Q&A sessions with complete strangers, and he sounds pretty extroverted, but if you rephrase that as six hours of continuous riffing on a topic that's been his fixation since he was a teenager, and it sounds more like an autistic person who's been able to arrange his life so it's as autism-friendly as possible. The way I'd think of it is that if there's someone who spends forty hours a week messing around with model trains, they sound pretty autistic. But if you meet that person because you're at a model train convention, 1) it's 100% on-topic for them to start up a conversation with you by talking about model trains, and 2) you're already about 99th percentile for being interested in model trains, so they just don't look that weird to you. Similarly, lots of the people who strike up conversations with Gates or Malone are people who want to talk about their special interests. And when they were doing deals for set-to boxes and equity injections, a maximum-bandwidth bidirectional infodump was probably great fun for both of them. What would someone born with those traits have done if they'd been born a century earlier? There were certainly plenty of careers that reward this bundle of traits. But they were less scalable. Presumably lots of mildly autistic people sorted themselves into more solitary, systematized career tracks, and many others were part of the vast majority of people who lived on farms. Urbanization creates opportunities for more specialization, which raises the potential returns of spending basically all of your brainpower thinking about what you specialize in. (The Pattern Seekers is not all that great, but it does mention some anecdotes from the early life of Thomas Edison, who did very well for himself in terms of historical impact and had financial outcomes that weren't too shabby, either. So he was an early beneficiary of this: more cities meant more demand for power plants, lightbulbs, and appliances.) Mass production and capital accumulation raised the returns for people who can think about complex systems, as did logistics networks like railroads—a business where day-to-day management could mean lots of interaction with telegraph machines (Carnegie’s first love, he could understand the incoming clicks by sound alone) rather than human beings, and a field that rewarded people who were good at mental arithmetic and could keep lots of datapoints in their heads. But the period where traits on the spectrum were maximally rewarded probably starts in the 70s, thanks to a series of mostly unrelated developments: The analog world is built around neurotypical preferences. How could it not be? If you hate how bad and loud the music is in various public places, remember that these places are made for the public, and that's basically what the public wants. The digital world is built by and for autistic people, and if you want The Internet to be a place where you spend all of your time reading about Rust, or the Eastern Roman Empire, or certain practical applications of matrix multiplication, you can more or less arrange your online life so these are all mainstream interests. This framing even describes some of the conflicts that modern tech companies have engendered. People complain about The Algorithm showing them rage-bait news, snuff films from Ukraine, scantily-clad women, scantily-clad men, etc. But The Algorithm is, basically, whatever you seem likely to engage with based on your past behaviors and those similar to you. The neurotypical user says "This isn't what I wanted," and the autistically accurate response is "But it's exactly what you asked for." You should expect this to get more common. Autism diagnosis rates have risen over time, so in terms of pure numbers they'll have a bigger impact. Part of the rise of autism is just that we have better diagnostic tools. Malone and Gates probably received informal diagnosis of autism-spectrum disorders on the playground, in the form of being called a "geek" or "spaz" or something, and at least some of the growth of autism as an identification is that it's not as pejorative as it used to be. But it's also quite heritable, so if people with autistic traits start being more likely to have kids together—perhaps because of assortative mating by education, which rose from the mid-20th century through the 90s before declining; perhaps because couples are meeting online;[3] Autistic couples are also more likely to read Bryan Caplan, take him as gospel, maybe run a few monte carlo simulations, and commit themselves to maximizing the net present value of future visits-from-the-grandkids; maybe they nerd out about religion and read-and-reason their way into believing that any form of birth control is intrinsically evil.[4][5] If the material rewards from these traits keep rising, they won't be as economically constrained as other couples: fertility rates tend to be u-shaped with respect to income, and higher within-couple variance lowers the opportunity cost of one parent downshifting their career for a while. The Internet, the more autism-first way of viewing the world, is increasingly interposed between you and the external world. You'll still talk IRL—about things you read about online. You go out to restaurants—that you saw on Google Maps. As smart glasses get more common and interactions with LLMs get more ubiquitous, an increasing share of reality will be filtered through consumer apps, meaning that everything you see will be filtered by an autistic person's idea of what a neurotypical person would like. So, in the end, there's a paradoxical separation that leads to synthesis. Someone who was born on the spectrum a century ago would probably have a slightly worse life because of it, and feel a bit separate from their peers. They might, through effort and luck, construct a wonderful life for themselves, but the world didn't provide a lot of the raw material to make that easy. Today, they're much more likely to get sorted into a peer group in which they're comparatively normal, and to be able to filter out some of the rough textures and annoyances of a 50th-percentile life. But in another sense, all this separation makes them more integrated with society than they've ever been. A disproportionate share of the software and hardware I used to write this article, and that you're using to read it, was produced by people on the spectrum. You are, in some tenuous but meaningful sense, interacting with all of them. And, mercifully, you aren't even attempting to make eye contact. An obvious question you might have here is: "Hey, Byrne, are you autistic?" I actually don't know, and at this point in my life I don't think it would be especially useful to spend time and money to find out whether the answer is "almost" or "slightly" or whatever. If I run down the list of symptoms, there are plenty of familiar ones, but then you run into the incommensurable life advice problem: maybe noticing when other people are bored by or annoyed with me is just as hard for everyone else, and I'm just lazy. On the other hand, it's pretty heritable, and one of my kids did get a formal diagnosis (of the interesting-tradeoff variety rather than the crippling-disability kind), and I've never had a serious relationship in which I wasn't asked if I was actually autistic. It is pretty helpful to know where on the spectrum your kids are, especially if your sense of a normal level of interest in human beings relative to objects and abstractions is not quite average. The lining/stacking-up-objects thing, for example, is real. For kids, the utility of a diagnosis is that they aren't able to arrange their life in an autism-friendly way, but their parents can, especially when they can wield a doctor's note to teachers and other authority figures. For adults, the main reason to care is that if you have some autism-spectrum traits, it's helpful to look up the full list in order to learn which other traits you have that, unbeknownst to you, are not actually universal. ↩︎ In addition, financing these shakier companies meant that there were economic rewards to coming up with clever restructuring plans when the bonds inevitably went sour. The First Junk Bond is a book-length treatment of the various financings, restructurings, exchanges, etc., that just one company, Texas International Co., went through in the early days of junk bonds. If you get a kick out of figuring out how to value an oil-denominated bond, or you have a photographic memory for who owns how much of which bond issue and which of those owners might either owe you a favor or accept an owed favor as compensation for a haircut on the value of their asset, you'd thrive in this environment. The upstanding and eminently clubbable gentlemen who ran the largest banks just couldn't compete. ↩︎ This one also probably selected more for autistic-autistic pairings in the pre-swipe era, when cameras weren't as good and a text-centric approach worked best. It will be interesting to see if autism rates are lower for children of the cohort that met after Tinderizing online dating apps A/B tested better than anything else. ↩︎ Granted, they might get equally into David Benatar instead. Societies develop cultural antibodies to antinatalism over time, for the obvious reason that any society that doesn't ceases to exist. Which means that you can safely refuse to engage with any particular antinatalist argument unless you happen to find it funny. If they're wrong, it's just a live look at something that's born a historical curiosity, since eventually anyone susceptible to these ideas won't leave descendants behind. And if they're right, well, central nervous systems first evolved half a billion years ago, so a few extra generations of meaningless suffering doesn't move the needle. ↩︎ Also, this is a long and accidental version of the Selfish Gene, where on-the-spectrum traits that would make someone in the 13th century feel a lot more at home living in a monastery—following a rigid schedule, adhering to a written list of rules, reading and writing theological tracts all day—now contributes to conferring a fertility advantage on the same set of genes. ↩︎ You're on the free list for The Diff.

Diff Jobs works with companies across fintech, hard tech, consumer software, enterprise software, and other areas—any company where finding unusually effective people is a top priority. OpenAI has modestly adjusted its projected cash needs through 2029, to $115bn from $35bn ($, The Information). AI bearishness takes two forms: the demand-side argument that the products just aren't that great and will never be that big a business, and the supply-side argument that AI is amazing but the space is too crowded and overcapitalized for anyone to make money. This update is actually net worse for the first argument, but helpful for the second: the reason OpenAI's projected losses are rising so fast is that their revenue numbers are rising fast. Every time revenue goes up, there will be another set of inputs where scale effects mean they're worth doing in-house. OpenAI had no business owning fabs or power plants a few years ago, or designing their own chips, but if doing that today means getting the compute and the power they need to meet the future demand they expect, then it's worth it. This shifts costs earlier in time, because it's creating a fixed cost to replace a variable cost. So far, OpenAI's growth is answering the demand-side question quite nicely, but they'll need to set a lot more scaling records to justify another $80bn in spending to get there. ASML has become a big strategic investor in Mistral. This is very fun from the perspective of commoditizing the complement: if there are more AI labs, there will be more demand for GPUs, and probably more skunkworks projects to develop custom chips. If some of those competing companies are open-weight, the factor that determines marginal cost for the cheapest models will be purely on the hardware (and power) side. So ASML is doing what it can to ensure that demand for the most semiconductor capital equipment is as high as possible, but also that the end market is as fragmented as possible. Anthropic has settled a class-action lawsuit for $1.5bn over their decision to pirate some of the half-million or so books they trained on. This works out to about $3k/book, or what a typical author would get if they moved another thousand or so copies of their book after having earned back their advance. This actually seems reasonably fair. Just as a ballpark, the collective very partial attention of all of the users of an LLM seems like it would be equivalent to selling around that many extra copies of a book. As AI companies get bigger, there will have to be more refined ways to think about how to split the upside from people providing training data, but there's a possible model where LLMs end up being an active subsidy for very niche writing, because it will have a hard time finding its audience in bookstores but can't help but find that same audience in the context of an LLM chat session. So far this year, 231 companies have gone public in the US, and 7 in the UK ($, FT). Which raises the question: how global should the stock market really be? Within countries, there's typically consolidation in listing venues over time; trades happen where there are already other trades happening. On the other hand, even within the US that leads to some frictional costs, and the financial industry professionals on the West Coast who get to the office before 5am might fondly wish that a few of the trillion-dollar West Coast-based companies they track were listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange, with West Coast hours, instead. That problem is a lot harder if Japanese and market professionals have to work the night shift to trade Japanese stocks. So there's still some regional gravity for exchanges. But many of the biggest companies in a given country are multinationals, and if the investor base is English-speaking and assets tend to get managed from the US, it's generally easier for these companies to have a US listing. So the same cultural and economic ties that make UK-based companies bigger than they'd otherwise be have, over time, turned the London Stock Exchange into something closer to a regional exchange. One of the drivers of private equity's growth is that they can lever up at the company level, and have a bunch of higher-volatility bets with capped downside, which makes their portfolio perform better. Levering a company is economically similar to owning an option on in, with the strike price equal to the value of the debt, and if that's combined with streamlining a company to focus on a narrower business, it can lead to some exciting returns (and a few blowups). but public markets can do that, too, and there's been a burst of spinoffs lately ($, WSJ). Because of how low fees have gotten and how liquid the assets in question are, diversification is cheaper for most investors than making single-name bets, which means the right structure for the market is have diversification at the portfolio level and to make each individual stock as focused and idiosyncratic as possible.

Title: The Autistic Half-Century
URL: https://www.thediff.co/archive/the-autistic-half-century/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In this issue: 2025 has been a good year for valedictory memoirs from some of the 20th century's great executives, like Bill Gates' Source Code and John Malone's Born to be Wired. Gates has a few cameos in Malone's book, as a business partner and investor. One reason the two of them got along pretty well is that they had something in common: each one notes, early in his memoir, that he's autistic, and that his life (and his parents'!) would have been easier if he'd known that earlier. When people talk about "autism," they're describing a wide spectrum of outcomes, including pretty serious disabilities that prevent severely autistic people from living on their own. When they use the term to describe themselves, they're referring to the more benign part—a combination of poor social skills, odd sensitivities (to food, texture, noise, etc.), and the ability-or-compulsion to focus for long periods on very narrow domains.[1] For the purpose of this piece, by "autistic" I'm generally referring to the part of the spectrum where people can hold down jobs and live independently, and not the more severe varieties. This used to be called Aspergers, but that incredibly useful, motte-and-baily-crushing distinction has been deprecated for some reason. This set of traits has existed for a long time; Heraclides of Pontus describes the maritime equivalent of being obsessed with trains in the 4th century BC. Isaac Newton was a vividly weird guy who spent more time on biblical and alchemical studies than on math and physics. (He was also a very literal, subtext-insensitive kind of person; he got a sinecure as Master of the Mint partly because the government wanted to reward him for his academic contributions, but insisted on actually doing the job, hunting down counterfeiters, etc.) One reason to suspect that many public figures have an autistic streak is a two-sided selection effect: they're more often in circumstances where it's natural and normal for them to do what would otherwise be autistic. Describe Warren Buffett as someone who periodically has six-hour Q&A sessions with complete strangers, and he sounds pretty extroverted, but if you rephrase that as six hours of continuous riffing on a topic that's been his fixation since he was a teenager, and it sounds more like an autistic person who's been able to arrange his life so it's as autism-friendly as possible. The way I'd think of it is that if there's someone who spends forty hours a week messing around with model trains, they sound pretty autistic. But if you meet that person because you're at a model train convention, 1) it's 100% on-topic for them to start up a conversation with you by talking about model trains, and 2) you're already about 99th percentile for being interested in model trains, so they just don't look that weird to you. Similarly, lots of the people who strike up conversations with Gates or Malone are people who want to talk about their special interests. And when they were doing deals for set-to boxes and equity injections, a maximum-bandwidth bidirectional infodump was probably great fun for both of them. What would someone born with those traits have done if they'd been born a century earlier? There were certainly plenty of careers that reward this bundle of traits. But they were less scalable. Presumably lots of mildly autistic people sorted themselves into more solitary, systematized career tracks, and many others were part of the vast majority of people who lived on farms. Urbanization creates opportunities for more specialization, which raises the potential returns of spending basically all of your brainpower thinking about what you specialize in. (The Pattern Seekers is not all that great, but it does mention some anecdotes from the early life of Thomas Edison, who did very well for himself in terms of historical impact and had financial outcomes that weren't too shabby, either. So he was an early beneficiary of this: more cities meant more demand for power plants, lightbulbs, and appliances.) Mass production and capital accumulation raised the returns for people who can think about complex systems, as did logistics networks like railroads—a business where day-to-day management could mean lots of interaction with telegraph machines (Carnegie’s first love, he could understand the incoming clicks by sound alone) rather than human beings, and a field that rewarded people who were good at mental arithmetic and could keep lots of datapoints in their heads. But the period where traits on the spectrum were maximally rewarded probably starts in the 70s, thanks to a series of mostly unrelated developments: The analog world is built around neurotypical preferences. How could it not be? If you hate how bad and loud the music is in various public places, remember that these places are made for the public, and that's basically what the public wants. The digital world is built by and for autistic people, and if you want The Internet to be a place where you spend all of your time reading about Rust, or the Eastern Roman Empire, or certain practical applications of matrix multiplication, you can more or less arrange your online life so these are all mainstream interests. This framing even describes some of the conflicts that modern tech companies have engendered. People complain about The Algorithm showing them rage-bait news, snuff films from Ukraine, scantily-clad women, scantily-clad men, etc. But The Algorithm is, basically, whatever you seem likely to engage with based on your past behaviors and those similar to you. The neurotypical user says "This isn't what I wanted," and the autistically accurate response is "But it's exactly what you asked for." You should expect this to get more common. Autism diagnosis rates have risen over time, so in terms of pure numbers they'll have a bigger impact. Part of the rise of autism is just that we have better diagnostic tools. Malone and Gates probably received informal diagnosis of autism-spectrum disorders on the playground, in the form of being called a "geek" or "spaz" or something, and at least some of the growth of autism as an identification is that it's not as pejorative as it used to be. But it's also quite heritable, so if people with autistic traits start being more likely to have kids together—perhaps because of assortative mating by education, which rose from the mid-20th century through the 90s before declining; perhaps because couples are meeting online;[3] Autistic couples are also more likely to read Bryan Caplan, take him as gospel, maybe run a few monte carlo simulations, and commit themselves to maximizing the net present value of future visits-from-the-grandkids; maybe they nerd out about religion and read-and-reason their way into believing that any form of birth control is intrinsically evil.[4][5] If the material rewards from these traits keep rising, they won't be as economically constrained as other couples: fertility rates tend to be u-shaped with respect to income, and higher within-couple variance lowers the opportunity cost of one parent downshifting their career for a while. The Internet, the more autism-first way of viewing the world, is increasingly interposed between you and the external world. You'll still talk IRL—about things you read about online. You go out to restaurants—that you saw on Google Maps. As smart glasses get more common and interactions with LLMs get more ubiquitous, an increasing share of reality will be filtered through consumer apps, meaning that everything you see will be filtered by an autistic person's idea of what a neurotypical person would like. So, in the end, there's a paradoxical separation that leads to synthesis. Someone who was born on the spectrum a century ago would probably have a slightly worse life because of it, and feel a bit separate from their peers. They might, through effort and luck, construct a wonderful life for themselves, but the world didn't provide a lot of the raw material to make that easy. Today, they're much more likely to get sorted into a peer group in which they're comparatively normal, and to be able to filter out some of the rough textures and annoyances of a 50th-percentile life.

Title: How The Trade Desk faces growing challenges amid rising competition

Join us Oct. 15-17 in Phoenix to connect with top media buyers Subscribe: Apple Podcasts • Spotify Ad tech isn’t an easy business. Just ask The Trade Desk. Once the crown jewel of the industry, The Trade Desk is presently having a rough go. Between missed revenue targets and rising competition from the likes of Amazon, cracks are starting to form in the company’s crown. For years, The Trade Desk was the premier platform, raking in enough spend to account for 33 consecutive quarters of meeting or beating expectations. Slowly, things started to change. Disgruntled media agency whispers around fees reached a fever pitch. Kokai, its AI-driven data platform upgrade, lost hype. Walmart split, ending the exclusive part of its partnership with The Trade Desk. Meanwhile, it seems Google and Amazon are looking to fill in any gaps The Trade Desk may leave open. “There was never any doubt that Amazon and Google were going to make a play for that part of the market with their DSPs,” said Seb Joseph, Digiday executive editor of news, on a recent episode of the Digiday Podcast. “It was just a question of when.” In this episode of the Digiday Podcast, Joseph and senior reporter of advertising technology Ronan Shields, join co-hosts Kimeko McCoy and Tim Peterson, to discuss the rise of The Trade Desk and the likelihood it’ll continue to hold its own in a changing DSP landscape. Also in this episode, OpenAI and Meta continue to fuel the AI arms race with AI-generated videos in TikTok-style feeds and Meta ups the ante by using chatbot data to target ads. Then, Paramount acquired Bari Weiss’ The Free Press and brought Weiss on as editor-in-chief of CBS News. Here are a few highlights from the conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. The Trade Desk’s tough year Peterson: There were bubbling concerns of “is The Trade Desk the next too big player in the ad tech space?” This year, the Trade Desk is still pretty dominant, but that dominance has definitely been put in check by… not even the rise of Amazon’s DSP, but Amazon’s DSP seems to have shifted into a new gear this year… As we’re recording this, Amazon announced a partnership with Spotify to have Spotify’s video and audio inventory available for sale through the Amazon DSP. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk has just had a tough year. Joseph: The Trade Desk has definitely had a rough time of it, probably going as far back as 18 months. You could feel that pressure building last spring when Amazon rolled out ads on Prime Video. As we reported, that move alone threw a spotlight on the Amazon ad business. By contrast, it pushed The Trade Desk into a more vulnerable position. But the real shift came when The Trade Desk missed its Q4 2024 numbers. Increased competition Shields: [Walmart] was one of the big temple narratives they had as a big player. It’s that pinstripe movement that they appeared to be in because the growth of the Amazon DSP is coming forward. That was probably more of a blow to its stock price. Losing Walmart, it’s not going to bolster the confidence of the market, sadly. That’s for sure. Much of this decline in its market value is due to the emergence of the Amazon DSP. There’s a saying out there, “If Amazon is getting into your business, it’s time to get out of your business.” That’s a cautionary tale. Acquire or be acquired? Joseph: I don’t think you can rule it [The Trade Desk being acquired by the likes of OpenAI] out. OpenAI generated $4.3 billion in revenue, but burned through $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. The need to spin up an ads business gets more intense by the quarter. Going on the M&A trail is the way to do that. Despite the issues with The Trade Desk, it’s still a robust business. Wu joined the Digiday Podcast for the latest installment of the show’s “Day in the Life” series, in which members of the media and marketing industries share their systems and tips for getting through the average work day. The news publisher’s chief AI officer detailed his new position and how the Post is using AI to power its subscription paywall in a Digiday Podcast live recording during the Digiday Publishing Summit. The brand exec shared how Ferrero is rethinking retail media as a full-funnel tool — but challenges remain — at the Retail Media Advertising Strategies event in New York City.

The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets. Rate cuts are contingent on the path of inflation and the labor market. Increased gold buying by China has also been supporting the bullion prices. China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value. Gold is the ultimate hedge against runaway debt. The world debt scenario is leading to the gold story. When the world runs on debt, gold becomes the final line of defense. The global debt-to-GDP ratio stands above 324%. Global debt climbing to a record-breaking height of $337.70 trillion. It’s this that’s driving gold and not inflation per se. Debt is climbing faster than output and gold has become the stabilizer. As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes.

Shares traded at Rs 1,023.80 on the NSE, down 2.51% Gold active futures reached a new high, hitting $4000 (~ Rs 120,900), as financial markets became increasingly unsettled due to the US government shutdown and a French political crisis. The political upheavals in Japan and France are escalating fiscal worries and fuelling the gold rally. · After unsuccessful attempts to come to an agreement with political parties about budget spending, which prevented efforts to control the biggest fiscal deficit in the euro area, Sebastien Lecornu resigned as the prime minister of France. The financial markets have also been shaken by Sanae Takaichi’s almost certain promotion to the position of prime minister of Japan. · This week, the US government shutdown continued, and the White House threatened to lay off a large number of federal employees. Additionally, this has prevented investors from accessing crucial information required to evaluate the state of the US economy, which further muddies the Fed’s decision-making process. The Fed’s latest interest rate cut and the expectation of more have helped, and central banks and gold-backed exchange-traded funds have been eager buyers. Technical Triggers · Gold has achieved the target of $4000 (~Rs 120,900) today. This rally can show more upward spikes, but one needs to be very cautious at this level. We can also see sharp sell-offs, as the psychological target is achieved. If Gold falls below $3850 (~Rs 117,000), we can say the top has been made, and a correction will follow Tata Capital IPO Day 2 live updates: The ₹15,512-crore Tata Capital IPO, the largest public issue of the year, opened for subscription on October 6 and close on October 8.

Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ).

Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens.

Title: Why fears of a trillion-dollar AI bubble are growing

By Seth Fiegerman, Carmen Reinicke, Bloomberg News For almost as long as the artificial intelligence boom has been in full swing, there have been warnings of a speculative bubble that could rival the dot-com craze of the late 1990s that ended in a spectacular crash and a wave of bankruptcies. Tech firms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on advanced chips and data centers, not just to keep pace with a surge in the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, but to make sure they’re ready to handle a more fundamental and disruptive shift of economic activity from humans to machines. The final bill may run into the trillions. The financing is coming from venture capital, debt and, lately, some more unconventional arrangements that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress. Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model. Tech industry executives who privately doubt the most effusive assessments of AI’s revolutionary potential — or at least struggle to see how to monetize it — may feel they have little choice but to keep pace with their rivals’ investments or risk being out-scaled and sidelined in the future AI marketplace. When Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan known as Stargate alongside other executives at the White House in January, the price tag triggered some disbelief. Since then, other tech rivals have ramped up spending, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has pledged to invest hundreds of billions in data centers. Not to be outdone, Altman has since said he expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on AI infrastructure. To finance those projects, OpenAI is entering into new territory. In September, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. announced an agreement to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data center buildout, a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether the chipmaker is trying to prop up its customers so that they keep spending on its own products. The concerns have followed Nvidia, to varying degrees, for much of the boom. The dominant maker of AI accelerator chips has backed dozens of companies in recent years, including AI model makers and cloud computing providers. Some of them then use that capital to buy Nvidia’s expensive semiconductors. The OpenAI deal was far larger in scale. OpenAI has also indicated it could pursue debt financing, rather than leaning on partners such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The difference is that those companies have rock-solid, established businesses that have been profitable for many years. OpenAI expects to burn through $115 billion of cash through 2029, The Information has reported. Other large tech companies are also relying increasingly on debt to support their unprecedented spending. Meta, for example, turned to lenders to secure $26 billion in financing for a planned data center complex in Louisiana that it says will eventually approach the size of Manhattan. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are also leading a loan of more than $22 billion to support Vantage Data Centers’ plan to build a massive data-center campus, Bloomberg News has reported. By 2030, AI companies will need $2 trillion in combined annual revenue to fund the computing power needed to meet projected demand, Bain & Co. said in a report released in September. Yet their revenue is likely to fall $800 billion short of that mark, Bain predicted. “The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” said David Einhorn, a prominent hedge fund manager and founder of Greenlight Capital. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.” In a sign of the times, there’s also a growing number of less proven firms trying to capitalize on the data center goldrush. Nebius, an Amsterdam-based cloud provider that split off from Russian internet giant Yandex in 2024, recently inked an infrastructure deal with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion. And Nscale, a little-known British data center company, is working with Nvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft on build-outs in Europe. Like some other AI infrastructure providers, Nscale previously focused on another frothy sector: cryptocurrency mining. The data center spending spree is overshadowed by persistent skepticism about the payoff from AI technology. In August, investors were rattled after researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of organizations saw zero return on their investment in AI initiatives. More recently, researchers at Harvard and Stanford offered a possible explanation for why. Employees are using AI to create “workslop,” which the researchers define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.” The promise of AI has long been that it would help streamline tasks and boost productivity, making it an invaluable asset for workers and one that corporations would pay top dollar for. Instead, the Harvard and Stanford researchers found the prevalence of workslop could cost larger organizations millions of dollars a year in lost productivity. AI developers have also been confronting a different challenge. OpenAI, Claude chatbot developer Anthropic and others have for years bet on the so-called scaling laws — the idea that more computing power, data and larger models will inevitably pave the way for greater leaps in the power of AI. Eventually, they say, these advances will lead to artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical form of the technology so sophisticated that it matches or exceeds humans in most tasks. Over the past year, however, these developers have experienced diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build more advanced AI. Some have also struggled to match their own hype. After months of touting GPT-5 as a significant leap, OpenAI’s release of its latest AI model in August was met with mixed reviews. In remarks around the launch, Altman conceded that “we’re still missing something quite important” to reach AGI. Those concerns are compounded by growing competition from China, where companies are flooding the market with competitive, low-cost AI models. While U.S. firms are generally still viewed as ahead in the race, the Chinese alternatives risk undercutting Silicon Valley on price in certain markets, making it harder to recoup the significant investment in AI infrastructure. There’s also the risk that the AI industry’s vast data center buildout, entailing a huge increase in electricity consumption, will be held back by the realities of strained national power networks. Sam Altman, the face of the current AI boom, has repeatedly acknowledged the risk of a bubble in recent months while maintaining his optimism for the technology. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? In my opinion, yes,” he said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Altman and other tech leaders continue to express confidence in the roadmap toward AGI, with some suggesting it could be closer than skeptics think. “Developing superintelligence is now in sight,” Zuckerberg wrote in July, referencing an even more powerful form of AI that his company is aiming for. In the near term, some AI developers also say they need to drastically ramp up computing capacity to support the rapid adoption of their services. Altman, in particular, has stressed repeatedly that OpenAI remains constrained in computing resources as hundreds of millions of people around the world use its services to converse with ChatGPT, write code and generate images and videos. OpenAI and Anthropic have also released their own research and evaluations that indicate AI systems are having a meaningful impact on work tasks, in contrast to the more damning reports from outside academic institutions. An Anthropic report released in September found that roughly three quarters of companies are using Claude to automate work. The same month, OpenAI released a new evaluation system called GDPval that measures the performance of AI models across dozens of occupations. “We found that today’s best frontier models are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts,” OpenAI said in a blog post. “Especially on the subset of tasks where models are particularly strong, we expect that giving a task to a model before trying it with a human would save time and money.” So how much will customers eventually be willing to pay for these services? The hope among developers is that, as AI models improve and field more complex tasks on users’ behalf, they will be able to convince businesses and individuals to spend far more to access the technology. “I want the door open to everything,” OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in late 2024, when asked about a report that the company has discussed a $2,000 monthly subscription for its AI products. “If it’s helping me move about the world with literally a Ph.D.-level assistant for anything that I’m doing, there are certainly cases where that would make all the sense in the world.” In September, Zuckerberg said an AI bubble is “quite possible,” but stressed that his bigger concern is not spending enough to meet the opportunity. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in a podcast interview. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” Bubbles are economic cycles defined by a swift increase in market values to levels that aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals. They’re usually followed by a sharp selloff — the so-called pop. A bubble often begins when investors get swept up in a speculative frenzy — over a new technology or other market opportunity — and pile in for fear of missing out on further gains. American economist Hyman Minsky identified five stages of a market bubble: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. Bubbles are sometimes difficult to spot because market prices can become dislocated from real-world values for many reasons, and a sharp price drop isn’t always inevitable. And, because a crash is part of a bubble cycle, they can be hard to pinpoint until after the fact. Generally, bubbles pop when investors realize that the lofty expectations they had were too high. This usually follows a period of over-exuberance that tips into mania, when everyone is buying into the trend at the very top. What comes next is a usually a slow, prolonged selloff where company earnings start to suffer, or a singular event that changes the long-term view, sending investors dashing for the exits. There was some fear that an AI bubble had already popped in late January, when China’s DeepSeek upended the market with the release of a competitive AI model purportedly built at a fraction of the amount that top U.S. developers spend. DeepSeek’s viral success triggered a trillion-dollar selloff of technology shares. Nvidia, a bellwether AI stock, slumped 17% in one day. The DeepSeek episode underscored the risks of investing heavily in AI. But Silicon Valley remained largely undeterred. In the months that followed, tech companies redoubled their costly AI spending plans, and investors resumed cheering on these bets. Nvidia shares charged back from an April low to fresh records. It was worth more than $4 trillion by the end of September, making it the most valuable company in the world. As with today’s AI boom, the companies at the center of the dot-com frenzy drew in vast amounts of investor capital, often using questionable metrics such as website traffic rather than their actual ability to turn a profit. There were many flawed business models and exaggerated revenue projections. Telecommunication companies raced to build fiber-optic networks only to find the demand wasn’t there to pay for them. When it all crashed in 2001, many companies were liquidated, others absorbed by healthier rivals at knocked-down prices. Echoes of the dot-com era can be found in AI’s massive infrastructure build-out, sky-high valuations and showy displays of wealth. Venture capital investors have been courting AI startups with private jets, box seats and big checks. Many AI startups tout their recurring revenue as a key metric for growth, but there are doubts as to how sustainable or predictable those projections are, particularly for younger businesses. Some AI firms are completing multiple mammoth fundraisings in a single year. Not all will necessarily flourish. “I think there’s a lot of parallels to the internet bubble,” said Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman and the CEO of Sierra, an AI startup valued at $10 billion. Like the dot-com era, a number of high-flying companies will almost certainly go bust. But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.

But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.

AWS Blogs Are you modernizing your legacy batch processing systems? At Vanguard, we faced significant challenges with our legacy mainframe system that limited our ability to deliver modern, personalized customer experiences. Our centralized database architecture created performance bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale services independently for our millions of personal and institutional investors. In this post, we show you how we modernized our data architecture using Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). You’ll learn how we transitioned to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture while preserving critical batch processing capabilities. We show you how this solution enabled us to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining cross-domain analytics capabilities—all while adhering to the principles of bounded contexts and distributed data ownership. Background and challenges As financial needs continue to evolve, Vanguard is committed to delivering adaptable, top-notch experiences that foster long-lasting customer relationships. This commitment spans from enhancing the personal investor journey to bringing personalized mobile dashboards and connecting institutional clients with advanced advice offerings. To elevate customer experience and drive digital transformation, Vanguard has embraced domain-driven design principles. This approach focuses on creating autonomous teams, fostering faster innovation, and building data mesh architecture. Central to this transformation is the Personal Investor team’s mainframe modernization effort, transitioning from a legacy system to a cloud-based, distributed data architecture organized around bounded contexts – distinct business domains that manage their own data. As part of this shift, each microservice now manages its own local data store using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition or Amazon DynamoDB. This approach enables domain-level data ownership and operational autonomy. Vanguard’s existing mainframe system, built on a centralized Db2 database, enables cross-domain data access and integration but also introduces several architectural challenges. Though batch processes can join data across multiple bounded contexts using SQL joins and database operations to integrate information from various sources, this tight coupling creates significant risks and operational issues. Challenges with the centralized database approach include: To address these architectural challenges, we chose to use Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). The Amazon Redshift architecture has compute and storage separation, which enables us to create multi-cluster architectures with a separate endpoint for each domain with independent scaling of compute and storage resources. Our solution leverages the data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining the ability to perform cross-domain analytics when needed. Key benefits of the Amazon Redshift solution include: Let’s explore the different solutions we evaluated before selecting ORDS with Amazon Redshift as our optimal approach. We implemented ORDS as our optimal solution after conducting a comprehensive evaluation of available options. This section outlines our decision-making process and examines the alternatives we considered during our assessment. Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS): In our evaluation, we found that using Amazon Redshift for ORDS provides a powerful solution for handling data across different business areas. It excels at managing large volumes of data from multiple sources, providing fast access to replicated data for batch processes that require cross-bounded context data, and combining information using familiar SQL queries. The solution particularly shines in handling high-volume reads from our data sources. Advantages: Disadvantages: Here are the other solutions we evaluated: Bulk APIs: We found that Bulk APIs provides an approach for handling large volumes of data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While Bulk APIs offer powerful capabilities, we found they require substantial team coordination and careful implementation to be effective. Data Lake: Our evaluation showed that data lakes can effectively combine information from different parts of our business. They excel at processing large amounts of data at once, providing search capabilities through unified data formats, and managing large volumes of diverse and complex data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While data lakes excel at big-picture analysis of large datasets, they weren’t optimal for our real-time data needs and complex data relationships. S3 Export/Exchange: In our analysis, we found that S3 Export/Exchange provides a method for sharing data between different business areas using file storage. This approach effectively handles large volumes of data and allows straightforward filtering of information using data frames. Advantages: Disadvantages: While S3 Export/Exchange works well for sharing large datasets between teams, it didn’t meet our requirements for quick, real-time access or immediately usable data formats. The following table provides a high-level comparison of the different data integration solutions we considered for our modernization efforts. It outlines where each solution is most appropriate to use and when it might not be the best choice: Fetching specific data subsets Many bounded context Large volume batch processing Point-in-time export is sufficient Structured, transactional data processing Many bounded contexts Table 1: Data Integration Solutions Comparison Based on our comparison, we found ORDS to be the optimal solution for our needs, particularly when our batch processes require access to data from multiple bounded contexts in real-time. Our implementation efficiently handles large volumes of data, significantly improving the performance of our batch jobs. We chose ORDS because it stores data in a familiar table format, accessible via SQL, making it simple and efficient for our teams to use. The architecture also aligns with our domain-driven design principles by enforcing clear data ownership, where each bounded context maintains responsibility for its own data management. This approach provides us with both scalability and reliability, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Amazon Redshift serves as the backbone of our ORDS implementation, offering several crucial features that support our modernization goals: Data Sharing Our solution leveraged the robust data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift, available on both Server-based Redshift RA3 instances and Redshift Serverless options. This functionality provided us with instant, secure, and live data access without copies, maintaining transactional consistency across our environment. The flexibility of same account, cross-account, and cross-Region data sharing has been particularly valuable for our distributed architecture. High Performance We’ve achieved significant performance improvements through Amazon Redshift’s efficient query processing and data retrieval capabilities. The system effectively handles our complex data needs while maintaining robust performance across various workloads and data volumes. Multi-Availability Zone Support Our implementation benefited from Amazon Redshift’s Multi-AZ support, which maintains high availability and reliability for our critical operations. This feature minimizes downtime without requiring extensive setup and significantly reduces our risk of data loss. Familiar Interface The relational environment of Amazon Redshift, similar traditional databases like Amazon RDS and IBM Db2, has enabled a smooth transition for our teams. This familiarity has accelerated adoption and improved productivity, as our teams can leverage their existing SQL expertise. By centralizing data from multiple business areas in ORDS using Amazon Redshift, we maintain consistent, efficient, and secure data access across our product teams. This setup is particularly valuable for our batch processing that requires data from various parts of the business, offering us a blend of performance, reliability, and ease of use. Here’s how our ORDS architecture implements Amazon Redshift data sharing to solve these challenges: Figure 1: Vanguard’s ORDS Architecture using Amazon Redshift Data Sharing Amazon Redshift Ingestion Pattern: We utilized Amazon Redshift’s zero-ETL functionality to integrate data and enable real-time analytics directly on operational data, which helped reduce complexity and maintenance overhead. To complement this capability and to fulfill our comprehensive compliance requirements that necessitate complete transaction replication, we implemented additional data ingestion pipelines. Our data ingestion strategy for Amazon Redshift employs different AWS services depending on the source. For Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL databases, we use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to directly replicate data into Amazon Redshift. For data from Amazon DynamoDB, we leverage Amazon Kinesis to stream the data into Amazon Redshift, where it lands in materialized views. These views are then further processed to generate tables for end-users. This approach allows us to efficiently ingest data from our operational data stores while meeting both analytical needs and compliance requirements. Amazon Redshift Data Sharing: We used the Amazon Redshift’s data sharing feature to effectively decouple our data producers from consumers, allowing each group to operate within their own boundaries while maintaining a unified and simplified governed mechanism for data sharing. Our implementation followed a clear process: once data is ingested and available in Amazon Redshift table format, we created views for consumers to access the data. We then established data shares and granted access to these views to consumer Amazon Redshift data warehouses for batch processing. In our environment with multiple bounded contexts, we’ve established a collaborative model where consumers work with various producer teams to access data from different data shares, each created per bounded context. This access remained strictly read-only—when consumers need to update or write new data that falls outside their bounded context, they must use APIs or other designated mechanisms for such operations. This approach has proven effective for our organization, promoting clear data ownership and governance while enabling flexible data access across organizational boundaries. It simplified our data management and made sure each team can operate independently while still sharing data effectively. Disclaimer: This is provided for reference purposes only and does not represent a real example. Let’s look at a practical example: our brokerage account statement generation process. This cross-bounded context batch process requires integrating data from multiple sources, accessing hundreds of tables and processing large volumes of data monthly. The challenge was to create an efficient, cost-effective solution that minimizes data replication while maintaining data accessibility.ORDS proved ideal for this use case, as it provides data from multiple bounded contexts without replication, offers near real-time access, and enables straightforward data aggregation using SQL-like queries in Amazon Redshift. The following diagram shows how we implemented this solution: Figure 2: Cross-Bounded Context Example for Brokerage Account Statement Generation We need the following bounded contexts to generate brokerage statements for millions of our clients. Through this architecture, we efficiently generate accurate and comprehensive brokerage account statements by consolidating data from these bounded contexts, meeting both our clients’ needs and regulatory requirements. Our journey with the Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) and Amazon Redshift has enhanced our client experience (CX) through improved data management and accessibility. By transitioning from our mainframe system to a cloud-based, domain-driven architecture, we have empowered our autonomous teams and established a resilient batch architecture. This shift facilitates efficient cross-domain data access, maintains high-quality data consistency, and provides scalability. Our ORDS implementation, supported by Amazon Redshift, offers near-real-time access to large data volumes, guaranteeing high performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. This modernization effort aligns with our mission to deliver exceptional, personalized client experiences and sustain long-lasting client relationships. If you are facing similar challenges with your batch processing systems, we encourage you to explore how an Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) can transform your data architecture. Start by assessing your current system’s limitations and identifying opportunities for improvement through domain-driven design and cloud-based solutions. Consider how this approach can help you manage large volumes of data from multiple sources, provide fast access to replicated data for batch processes, and support high-volume reads from various data sources. Take the next step by conducting a proof of concept (POC) to evaluate ORDS effectiveness in achieving efficient cross-domain data access, improving the performance of batch jobs, and maintaining clear data ownership within your business domains. By implementing this solution, you can enhance your data management capabilities, reduce operational risks, and drive innovation within your organization. Embrace this opportunity to elevate your data architecture and deliver exceptional customer experiences. Our transition to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture with ORDS using Amazon Redshift has successfully transformed our batch processing capabilities in AWS cloud. This modernization effort has significantly enhanced the performance, reliability, and scalability of our batch operations while maintaining seamless data access and integration across different business domains. The strategic adoption of ORDS has harnessed the potential of cross-domain data access in a distributed environment, providing us with a robust solution for real-time data access and efficient batch processing. This transformation has empowered us to better meet the demands of the digital age, delivering superior customer experiences and reinforcing our commitment to innovation in the financial services industry.

Title: OpenAI to buy $10B+ worth of AMD hardware, stock through new partnership
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/06/openai-buy-10b-worth-amd-hardware-stock-new-partnership/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T19:25:05Z

UPDATED 15:25 EDT / OCTOBER 06 2025 by Maria Deutscher OpenAI will buy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of data center hardware from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. as part of a partnership announced today. The ChatGPT developer could also receive the option to purchase about 160 million AMD shares, which represents an approximately 10% stake. The amount of stock that OpenAI will buy depends partly on how well it fulfills the terms of the partnership. The collaboration will see the artificial intelligence provider deploy 6 gigawatts’ worth of AMD graphics processing units to power its workloads. OpenAI will kick off the project with a one gigawatt deployment of the chipmaker’s upcoming Instinct MI450 GPU series. According to OpenAI, work on that initial cluster will begin in the second half of 2026. The MI450 is the planned successor to the MI355X, AMD’s flagship data center AI accelerator. The MI355X is a liquid-cooled GPU that includes 10 chiplets, three different types of AI cores and 288 gigabytes of HBM3E memory. It can provide more than 10 petaflops of performance when processing FP4 numbers, lightweight units of data that AI models often use in calculations. “With energy and cost critical issues, infrastructure decisions will increasingly be driven by a platform’s ability to deliver the best balance of speed, economics, and energy efficiency for each application it’s running,” said Sid Sheth, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of AI hardware startup d-Matrix Inc. The MI355X is designed for use in both AI clusters and supercomputers. It’s believed the upcoming MI450 will have a more specialized design optimized solely for AI infrastructure. According to a May report, the chip will lack support for certain data formats that are commonly used in supercomputers but aren’t as popular among language model developers. It’s believed the MI450 will also support a technology called Ultra Accelerator Link, or UALink for short. It’s an open-source interconnect for linking together the GPUs in AI clusters. The current iteration of the standard supports clusters with up to 1,024 AI accelerators. OpenAI and AMD describe their partnership as a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement.” That hints the ChatGPT developer plans to purchase not only the MI450 but also subsequent generations of chips. “Our partnership with OpenAI is expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI’s AI infrastructure buildout,” said AMD Chief Financial Officer Jean Hu. It’s possible the deal will see OpenAI buy not only chips but also other types of hardware. Last year, AMD spent $4.8 billion to acquire ZT Systems Inc., a low-profile developer of servers and rack-scale systems. In May, SemiAnalysis reported that the chipmaker plans to ship the MI450 as part of rack-scale appliances that will each contain 128 GPUs. The appliances are expected to launch in the second half of 2026, which is when OpenAI plans to start building its initial one gigawatt MI450 deployment. The partnership with AMD includes a stock warrant that will give OpenAI the option to buy 160 million shares of the chipmaker’s shares if certain conditions are met. The first batch of shares is set to vest once OpenAI sets up its initial one gigawatt deployment. According to AMD, the remaining stock will become available gradually as additional data center capacity comes online. OpenAI must also fulfill certain other requirements to access the shares. It will have to meet “technical and commercial milestones required to enable AMD deployments at scale,” the companies said. Additionally, the chipmaker’s share price will have to top a certain unspecified threshold. The tie-up comes less than a month after Nvidia Corp. agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a similar partnership. The ChatGPT developer will deploy at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of hardware powered by Vera Rubin, Nvidia’s next flagship AI chip. Like AMD’s MI450 series, the processor is expected to start shipping in the second half of 2026. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: AI could wipe out 100M US jobs – from nurses to truck drivers – over the next decade: report

Artificial intelligence and automation could wipe out nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) on Monday. The analysis – ironically based on ChatGPT findings – found the new tech could erase jobs from a wide range of fields, including white- and blue-collar roles. AI, automation and robotics could hit 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast food workers, according to Sanders, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” Debates over AI regulation have been heating up in Washington. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The Trump administration has argued that the US should lead the world in AI development, claiming it could pose a national security threat if China wins the race. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are calling for increased regulation on the sector – as well as worker protections like a 32-hour workweek and a “robot tax” on companies switching to automation. Amazon and Walmart – two of the largest publicly-traded US companies by revenue – have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs as they have leaned into automation efforts. In an op-ed for Fox News on Monday, Sanders warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” He argued that AI is simply being used as a tool to further concentrate wealth, nodding to CEOs who have invested billions into automation while announcing mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures. Sanders warned of a devastating hit to workers in the manufacturing industry, as well as truck, bus and taxi drivers, as automakers and tech startups increasingly ramp up their self-driving projects. “Some of the very wealthiest people in the world, including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos – are now investing hundreds of billions into these revolutionary technologies,” Sanders wrote in his op-ed. “Why is that? Is it because they want to improve the standard of living of the 60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck – Americans who are struggling to pay for groceries, healthcare, housing and education? Maybe. But I doubt it.” “I think it’s because investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially,” he continued. Advertisement

Title: Major challenge to Nvidia: OpenAI’s massive new computing push will run on AMD chips | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI announced Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia (NVDA) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the breakthrough video generator Sora 2. Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a $100 billion partnership, in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD (AMD) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering. In addition to the AMD and Nvidia deals, OpenAI agreed last month to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for 4.5 gigawatts of data center space. And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal with Broadcom to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

Title: Why Private Equity Is Making Small-Cap Investing Harder

Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com It’s getting tough out there for the little guys. Small-cap stocks have started to lose some of their performance zing compared with large caps. The reason: Private equity and venture capital firms have been snapping up many promising small companies that otherwise would likely have gone public, wresting those potentially lucrative opportunities away from public investors. Over the past two years there has been a widening gap in quality between large-cap and small-cap stocks, according to a recent Morningstar analysis. That includes returns on assets, returns on equity, net margin and debt-to-capital ratios showing that overall, small-cap stocks have increasingly weaker fundamentals compared with large caps, Morningstar passive strategies analyst Zachary Evens said. It’s not hard to find examples of once-startups that have rocketed to become massive companies that would be right at home next to the Magnificent Seven, if they ever had IPOs: OpenAI, SpaceX and Anthropic, for example, Evens noted. “Increasingly, tomorrow’s huge stocks are already big,” he wrote. And if the trend continues, “tomorrow’s big stocks never exist as a small-cap public company.” The tradeoff for the higher volatility of small caps is the potential for outperformance. But the prospects for that have been eroding quickly. Between 1991 and 2024, Morningstar’s US Small Cap Index lagged the US Large Cap Index by 0.49% per year on average, amounting to a 400% lag cumulatively. Still, small caps as a whole outperformed large caps from the mid ‘90s until about 2014, when the relative growth of the small cap index began to slide. In a recent whitepaper, Osterweis Capital Management cited opportunities for small-cap active managers: Let’s Go Out in Public: It could be a time for active managers to really show their worth. They’re just going to have a difficult time doing so, Evens noted. “It provides opportunities for the best small-cap managers, but it doesn’t change the opportunity set from which they are picking stocks,” he said. “Even the best active managers may not have the opportunity to invest in the highest growth potential small-cap stocks, if those remain in private markets.” Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. Semiliquid funds topped $450 billion in assets, but a handful of private credit ETFs have been slow to win over investors. ETFs that use artificial intelligence to select holdings have largely underperformed over the past five years. Many have closed. The company is reportedly considering adding third-party products to its brokerage,, but Vanguard said it hasn’t made any decisions. The ETF strategy lets wealthy investors defer, or even avoid, capital gains tax liabilities. Man Group is the latest to join the ETF bonanza, and it’s far from alone. The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Could staking your compensation on an all-or-nothing bet make you a better leader—or just a higher-stakes gambler? That question is resurfacing in boardrooms as “moonshot” pay packages gain traction among CEOs and boards seeking to inspire extraordinary performance and lock in ambitious talent, writes my colleague Amanda Gerut. The concept, first thrust into the spotlight by Elon Musk’s 2018 Tesla deal, has reemerged in striking fashion through Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprise, the maker of Taser stun guns and police body cameras. In 2018, Smith accepted an unconventional offer: no bonuses, no meaningful salary (just $31,000 a year), and no equity unless he could grow Axon’s market cap tenfold over the next decade. Each $1 billion increase unlocked a tranche of stock, with the ultimate goal of lifting the company’s value from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. It was a daring bet, but one that paid off. Within five years, Smith had blown past each goal and became the highest-paid CEO in America in 2024 with $165 million in compensation. The stock surged more than 600%. Moonshot packages invert the standard logic of executive pay. Instead of the usual mix of salary, annual bonuses, and performance shares, they tie virtually all potential compensation to long-term milestones, often at seemingly impossible levels. Advocates argue that they strengthen alignment with shareholders, encourage long-term thinking, and inject urgency into the transformation process. Smith even extended a version of his plan to Axon employees, allowing them to trade portions of their pay for stock that vested alongside his. But the approach is not without controversy. The plans are highly volatile, difficult to calibrate, and often unpopular with investors wary of oversized payouts or asymmetric risk. Miss the mark, and the CEO gets nothing. Hit it too quickly, and shareholders may accuse boards of overpaying. Still, the model is spreading because, the rationale goes, extraordinary results demand extraordinary incentives, and in a market obsessed with innovation and valuation multiples, big bets may be the price of attracting and retaining elite executive talent. Whether these moonshots create enduring value or prove to be flashes of fortune remains an open question. What’s clear is that they represent a new frontier in corporate risk-taking—one that fuses pay, purpose, and performance into a single, high-stakes wager on leadership itself.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mkvtw6t3n Share article Print article There is a buzz of anticipation around Chris Kraus’ latest novel The Four Spent the Day Together, following the success of the television adaption of her postmodern feminist cult classic I Love Dick (1997). Review: The Four Spent the Day Together – Chris Kraus (Scribe) Kraus’ novels to this point have all been self-referential. The typical Kraus novel, as she recently explained, provides a fictionalised “case study of my life”. She writes what literary academic Mira Mattar calls “unconstrained, disobedient texts”, using “her own most immediately available raw material”. Though Kraus resists the term “autofiction”, she is interested in testing the limits of memoir, unsettling fact and fiction to deliver provocative commentaries on contemporary American culture. Her work combines high and low cultural elements with postmodern play, drawing on influences such as philosopher Jean Baudrillard and writer Kathy Acker, about whom she has written a landmark biography. This time, however, Kraus has added a true-crime twist, a move that changes the stakes of her novel’s biting social commentary. The Four Spent the Day Together is arguably Kraus’s most conceptually ambitious, formally interesting, and politically charged novel to date. Written in three historically overlapping sections, spanning the 1960s to the 2020s, it pursues new directions for her writing. The novel traces the tensions of everyday life in a declining global superpower. Its themes range from the rise of neoliberal greed, gentrification and the prison-industrial complex, to the toxic cloud of reactionary politics, censorship and cancel-culture that has settled over a twitterised America, including its literary culture. The Four Spent the Day Together initially presents itself as the story of an artist named Catt Greene – Kraus’ fictional alter ego, who is also the author of a book called I Love Dick. Readers will recall her from Kraus’ 2012 novel Summer of Hate (where she is named Catt Dunlop). The first section reads as a coming-of-age novel about Catt’s rebellious teenage years growing up in Milford, Connecticut. The second section is a work of thinly veiled autofiction about the pressures of Catt’s life as a middle-aged writer married to a recovering addict. In its final section, The Four Spent the Day Together becomes a “true-crime novel”. The move allows Catt to decentre herself, write about issues that fall well outside her usual field of vision as an artist. She sees parallels between her life and some teenagers involved in a meth-fuelled murder case. In exposing the similarities, Kraus deftly allegorises how poverty, racism and political corruption produce cycles of inequality for working-class Americans. Beginning in Milford during the turbulent 1960s, The Four Spent the Day Together adopts that era’s key slogan. It shows how “the personal is political”. Kraus reflects on the gentrification of Brooklyn, which prices Catt’s parents out of their working-class neighbourhood. The family moves to suburban Milford, where extreme economic inequality also predominates, despite the differences from the city. Catt’s father spends most of his days away at work in Cambridge University Press’s Manhattan office. Her mother remains at home caring for their two children, a housewife suffering from what second-wave feminist Betty Friedan called the “unspoken” problem haunting middle-class white women. Her sister Carla is struggling with a misdiagnosed developmental disability, which the precocious Catt openly resents, leading her to act out. Swept up in her generation’s spirit of rebelliousness, Catt becomes involved in the counterculture of sit-ins, drugs, motorcycles and radical politics. The novel then lurches forward in time to focus on Catt’s career as a writer and creative-writing professor, and on her relationships. Politics again rears its head in the characters’ everyday lives. Catt and her first husband, an older French philosophy professor (a principal character in I Love Dick), protest against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s infernal war in the Middle East and the reign of “antiterrorist” terror – one agenda of which was to crush political dissent by policing antiwar protesters. Political solidarity draws Catt to her second husband Paul Garcia (who also appears in Summer of Hate). Paul has served a trumped-up three-year prison sentence following a drug-fuelled crime spree, in which he stole $900 from a corporation Cheney had invested in. Catt and her first husband sponsor Paul to undertake a psychology degree, as he struggles to turn his life around. As Catt’s open marriage withers, she and Paul purchase a vacation house in rural Balsam, Minnesota: the land of Bob Dylan’s North Country Blues. Catt hopes to secure a creative retreat from the bustle of Los Angeles. Paul seeks a refuge from the difficulties of his social work in the city’s poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods. The longer they spend in the sublimely beautiful landscape of northern Minnesota, the more they become exposed to its dark enigmas. Once an iron-ore powerhouse, the post-industrial Iron Range is now a region in decline. Clinging to myths of a lost era of prosperity, it has become a MAGA stronghold of deeply encrusted conservatism, stark economic inequalities and rampant addiction. An epidemic of methamphetamines (or “hillbilly heroin” as it was dubbed in the 2000s) has spiralled out of control. The locale proves unhelpful to Paul’s recovery. A shift to his perspective in this section is crucial for the novel’s personalisation of politics. Paul is a working-class American from a racial minority and a mental health support worker. His life has been one of hardship. His perspective ties the book’s threads of political commentary together. A harrowing career counselling troubled youths and addicts, while struggling with his own recovery from addiction, leads him into a downward spiral: drink-driving offences, job layoffs and marital breakdown. The novel’s final section, set in the late 2010s, finds Catt grappling with the prospect of a second divorce. At this point, she learns of a murder trial in nearby Hibbing, Minnesota. Three teenagers are accused of conspiring to murder an acquaintance while under the influence of crystal meth. Their families, law enforcement, the community, Catt, and even the suspects themselves fail to understand their motives. Attempting to escape her personal and professional troubles, Catt becomes obsessed with the investigating the case. Rather than focus on the innocence or guilt of the accused, she studies their childhood experiences of poverty, broken homes, abuse and undiagnosed disability. In preparing this novel, Kraus conducted over 100 interviews with individuals who were in some way connected to the crime. It is worth noting that her publisher has heavily promoted this final section, going so far as to call The Four Spent the Day Together a “true crime” novel, even though this subplot does not materialise until the final third of the book. What is the upshot of this sudden detour into “true-crime fiction”? What are the implications of thinking about the book in this way? “Crimes are like books,” Kraus reflected in a recent interview, in that a “crime brackets life in the same way that a novel brackets time, and within the brackets you can start to study different flows”. This can lead to “a belated understanding of the whole systemic injustice that led to the situation in the first place”. Reading backwards from this point, we might trace how Kraus’s has plotted her personal history in a way that foreshadows the novel’s turning point. First, she probes her family’s troubles with depression and disability, and her own youthful experiments with recreational drugs and petty crime. Then she considers the difficulties of living with a spouse who is attempting to turn his life around but is caught at every turn, stigmatised as a felon and addict within a judicial system that racially profiles him. By refocusing the story around the lives of a group of kids before and after they commit an atrocious crime, Kraus challenges herself to “see things from the character’s point of view, not my point of view” in order to “psychically penetrate the mindscape of these kids and how they see things”. Incorporating investigative materials into a literary reconstruction of those characters and events, she explores the parallels between her history and theirs. What can a grisly meth-fuelled murder in northern Minnesota’s Iron Range tell us about post-industrial decline and the malaises of drug addiction, poverty and rising right-wing conservatism? Taking a leaf out of Truman Capote’s book (specifically, his “non-fiction novel” In Cold Blood), Kraus blends journalism with autofiction to explore how these characters’ lives are contoured by historical ruptures brought about by political struggles. Catt’s investigations into what pushed three teenagers to murder an acquaintance in cold blood lead to more urgent questions regarding what has gone so terribly wrong in American life. In a sense, Kraus is not writing a book about a crime, but about what a crime can teach us about what books do. For if books are like crimes, as she claims, then writing can be understood as means of “investigating things” by “looking a little deeper than people look in the course of an anesthetized daily life”. “The pleasure of reading is that the writer has looked that far and is telling you things that you either didn’t know or you knew in some subliminal way,” she explains. “The function of writing is to give thoughts and feelings a voice, and to bring them forward to articulate them.” On one level, the unexpected third section of the novel is Kraus using “true-crime fiction” to expose her culture’s inability to grapple with these sorts of issues. Kraus’ cult following includes major contemporary writers such as Sheila Heti, Rachel Kushner and Maggie Nelson, as well as celebrities Lena Dunham and Alexa Chung. But some readers will likely not agree with all Kraus has to say. She is razor-sharp about literary critics, within a wider satire of cultural criticism in the age of social media. Through Catt, Kraus also reflects on the strange consequences of becoming famous after the television adaptation of I Love Dick. At first, Catt is regarded as a trailblazing “older white feminist” and a forebear of the #MeToo movement. But she soon draws ire for refusing to boycott a Los Angeles artists’ collective accused of tacitly supporting the gentrification of working-class Chicano suburbs. Kraus here turns her satirical gaze back onto privileged but unaware Ivy League students and other commentators, who picketed her speaking events at NYU when she was promoting her Acker biography. In Summer of Hate, she wrote about her experiences investing in and restoring dilapidated apartment complexes in the 2000s. The project aimed at increasing decent and affordable housing for low-income families. In The Four Spent the Day Together, Catt (like Kraus) finds herself likened to coldblooded property investors like the Trump family – “slumlords” who profit from ruthless campaigns of racial redlining and gentrification (see Woody Guthrie’s classic song about the shady dealings and racism of his landlord Fred Trump for a concise account). Without knowing her, the protesters accuse Catt of “racially fetishising” her husband. Revisiting these scandals could, on one level, be dismissed as merely defensive. But Kraus also uses these uncomfortable experiences to develop an incisive social commentary on the toxic twitterisation of politics and culture. She draws attention to the contradictions and reactionary tendencies of social media and online communities, as well as the dangerous effects of censorship when these tendencies migrate into the sphere of literature and criticism. Kraus has said that, in writing this novel, she hoped it might provide “a window into what the culture and consciousness is outside of the intellectual worlds in mainstream America”. This is, she observed, “not something that’s looked at much in high art” in the United States. The Four Spent the Day Together, however, achieves precisely that. It culminates in a vision of cultural vacuity, rampant political corruption, overpolicing and mass incarceration – and public health and welfare systems that fail to provide adequate safety nets for individuals or support for communities in crisis. Instead of an autobiography with a true-crime novel tacked on, we are left with a sobering allegory of America’s contradictions and its longstanding political inequalities. Kraus describes how these have deepened and morphed into new, frightening shapes over the past 60 years. Provocative yet unflinching, The Four Spent the Day Together promises to ignite difficult conversations about what has led to the culture and politics of Trump’s America 2.0.
