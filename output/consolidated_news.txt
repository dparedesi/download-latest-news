Title: Finally, the BOAK (after decades), K.M. and Meloni for trains, Greek companies in Turkey, where Ethniki is looking to buy, the Indian competitors of Aegean

Hello, so just to say something positive for a change, after a few decades the BOAK is finally being signed today in Crete with lights and torches (GEK TERNA) in the presence of Mitsotakis—I imagine that since it’s nearby, he’ll also pop over to his house in Chania for a swim. Announcements on Monday Meanwhile, Kyriakos Kyranakis’s visit yesterday at noon to the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Salvini and the inspection he then conducted at Italian railway facilities have a rich backstory, but announcements are expected to be made on Monday by Mitsotakis and Meloni from Palazzo Chigi, at the rescheduled Intergovernmental Conference between the two countries. In any case, Kyranakis’s request to his counterpart was for the Italians to seriously invest in new train sets, while the Italians, in turn, are asking us to invest in the network and in safety standards. The consequences for the Rectors I wrote to you yesterday about the government interventions in the universities, but let me add one more piece of information: the deadline for rectors to submit safety plans for their universities is the end of July. Also, by the end of the year they must have drawn up Internal Regulations, which are essentially the constitutional charter of a university. Rectors who don’t “play ball” will face administrative sanctions, even pay cuts, if they choose to resist, although the Ministry of Education estimates that a common ground will be found. The mission to Turkey Deputy Foreign Minister Tasos Chatzivasileiou has been in Istanbul since yesterday; today he will meet with his counterpart Mehmet Kemal Bozay, and then the two of them will address the Greece–Turkey Business Conference. The organization of the conference is being handled by Enterprise Greece, the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, SEV, SEVE, and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, while Mr. Chatzivasileiou is accompanied by top executives from major players in Greek business. Among others, there are representatives from Metlen, Base Metal of the HALCOR group, Europa Aluminium, Swissport, Elbak, Pobuca, and Sky Express. The National Bank, the next step, and the dilemma That the National Bank of Greece is preparing an acquisition move aimed at boosting its revenues in anticipation of further interest rate cuts is well known and already priced in by the market. Efforts in domestic asset management don’t seem to be yielding results. At the same time, glances toward Italy (from all banks) haven’t produced any outcome, as entry into the Italian banking market is neither easy nor straightforward, while the insurance sector—currently in turmoil—is proving more accessible. Ergo and NN appear more receptive, especially the former, which has caught the eye of more than one bank, and Groupama could also be a viable option. One issue complicating matters for the National Bank is the special rights held by the state, namely the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), which remain in place despite the reduction of its stake from 40.4% to 8.39%. The National Bank isn’t worried about whether it will happen or not, because there is a vague initial “OK” from the ESM. However, the relevant legislative provision must be drafted, the ESM must agree to it, and then it must pass through Parliament. The problem is that acquisitions are typically handled within a tight circle of top management—at most three to five executives, such as the CEO, the CFO, etc. But the special rights of the state involve the HCAP board members in the plan, thus widening the circle, since advisors, lawyers, and others are already in the game alongside the bank executives. In mergers and acquisitions, however, you are obliged to act quickly to close the initial deal. In such a case, you take the risk of convincing the special-rights shareholder after the fact, who views the matter from their own (different) perspective and won’t be especially happy if they feel they’ve been ignored. Avramar’s “overcoat” and Amerra’s obstacles We’ve entered May and the sale of Avramar to the Arabs of Aqua Bridge remains pending. The UAE fund and the selling banks initially expected to have a deal by the end of April or early May, but it is said that Amerra Capital, the other shareholder along with Mubadala, is creating obstacles. The American capital initially acquired Andromeda from Global Finance and then, together with Mubadala, bought Nireus and Selonda to form Avramar, the biggest player in Mediterranean aquaculture. Amerra and its executives ran Avramar and drove it onto the rocks, prompting the banks to step in again to find a buyer. And while Aqua Bridge is waiting, Amerra reportedly is setting conditions that are hard to accept. Logically, a solution will be found and it’s said to be near, as all sides want the matter to be concluded smoothly. The good news is that under the new management, things have gotten back on track and Avramar has stabilized, increasing its revenues and improving its metrics. Dividend and forecasts for Aegean Aegean’s stock is steadily climbing, reaching 12-month highs and closing yesterday at €12.70. The airline is benefiting, among other factors, from the positive start to the tourism season and from declining oil prices. Management wants to capitalize on the momentum, which remains positive despite broader international uncertainties, and this year will increase its offered capacity by 1.9 million seats in 2025—a growth rate higher than the European industry average. For the full year, AEGEAN plans to offer 21.5 million seats, with routes spanning 47 countries and 249 destinations. Naturally, there’s also the dividend factor, with Aegean standing out among listed companies by distributing €0.80 per share (€0.76 net), representing a gross yield of over 6%, one of the highest on the board. In a few days, specifically on Tuesday 20/5, the ex-dividend date is set, and payment will begin on 26/5. Aegean’s Indian Competitor And since we are on the topic of Aegean, I should mention that the airline’s management plans to enter the Indian market by the end of 2026 will not be a walk in the park. Aegean’s plans for this particular route will have to contend with the presence of a competitor. The Indian airline IndiGo also intends to start flights to and from Athens in 2026. It is a low-cost carrier based near New Delhi that serves 63% of passenger traffic in India. The company’s CEO, Peter Elbers, is in Athens and even met with Kyriakos Mitsotakis yesterday. IndiGo does not currently operate flights to EU airports, and its first European presence will begin in Athens, with Geneva as a second target. Additionally, note that it expects to take delivery of new A321 aircraft. OPAP Confirms Its Reputation OPAP’s stock is a classic investment choice for those who believe in steady economic growth and expect high dividend returns. One of the characteristics of OPAP’s stock behavior so far is that whenever it “cuts” a dividend, the stock drops for a few sessions, allowing investors to increase their positions at a lower price, only for the stock to regain its momentum shortly afterward. This is exactly what happened last Monday ahead of the distribution of the remaining dividend (€0.80 per share) for 2024. The stock declined, providing an opportunity for those who wanted to invest at a lower price, and as of yesterday, it returned to €19.40 with a market capitalization of €7.2 billion. Bank Guarantees, the Eldorado for Insurance Companies The explosive increase in large public works assignments, aided by the Development Fund, the NSRF, and the Public Investment Program (PIP), has created a demand for the issuance of bank guarantees, which are necessary for taking on these projects. While banks play a leading role in issuing guarantees, recently insurance companies with strong reinsurance backing and the necessary licensing (notable examples include Interamerican and Europa Insurance) have also increased their participation in issuing guarantees. There are also other examples, such as the smaller Euroins Insurance, which belongs to the Eurohold Group. Over the last 7 months, Euroins has changed its management structure, appointed Greek CEO Angeliki Mouratidou, quickly restructured its automobile insurance department—its core activity—and focused on guaranteeing smaller projects, which has boosted turnover by 30% compared to last year, as well as profitability. The New Investment Fund of the HCAP Its name is IIF (Infrastructure & Innovation Fund), and it will be the new specialized subsidiary of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), aimed at investing in key economic sectors of Greece, particularly in infrastructure, innovative businesses, green transition, and digitalization of the economy. Bureaucratic procedures are being finalized, the absorption of the HCAP portfolio was slightly more complicated than initially planned, but by early June, the IIF will begin operations, initially with a capital of €303.5 million, derived from the transfer of EYATH S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thessaloniki) and EYDAP S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Athens) back to the state. There are also plans for new sources of funding. The new IIF will operate as a subsidiary of Growthfund, with independent governance, management, and investment decisions, and BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (“BlackRock FMA”) will be its strategic advisor. BlackRock FMA has significant experience in investment and asset management, risk management, and technology, as well as extensive knowledge in advising institutional entities on capital markets issues. Trump’s Tariff Policy Benefited Germany’s Exports Since the “day of liberation,” the world has been living in great uncertainty regarding the tariffs that President Trump would eventually impose on imported goods and services in the U.S. As expected, ahead of the potential tariff imposition, the U.S. market rushed to accelerate imports and stock up in order to benefit from the transition period. The first beneficiary of this new situation was… the German economy. Germany’s trade surplus jumped sharply to €21.1 billion in March, from €18 billion in February. This surge was driven by an increase in exports, as businesses rushed to send goods before the expected U.S. tariffs were imposed. German exports rose by 1.1% on a monthly basis, while imports fell by 1.4%. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. was the top destination for German exports, which increased by 2.4% from February, as American buyers accelerated purchases to avoid potential tariff hikes. First Bank Product for Trump’s Tariffs HSBC announced that it had developed a new loan product specifically targeted at U.S. companies struggling to cover the costs of Trump’s tariffs, which have disrupted global supply chains. HSBC is offering working capital to businesses facing pressure on their cash flows due to higher import costs and supply chain disruptions. The bank is also providing support for businesses in managing the immediate financial impacts of tariffs, while they adjust their procurement strategies and re-route their supply chains before passing on costs to consumers. The loan offers flexible repayment terms and a tailored risk assessment, recognizing the heightened uncertainty in global trade. The False Image of Market Indices – 42% of Russell 2000 Companies Are in Losses We daily read and hear about the spectacular rise of indices in Wall Street’s stock markets. However, these indices only reflect a part of the U.S. economic reality, namely the large and powerful (primarily technological) business conglomerates. For smaller-cap stocks, Wall Street is not as generous. The truth is that the new tariff regime, regardless of the final amount, will primarily hurt small-cap companies and small businesses. Futures contracts predict further declines, as investors bet on additional drops in small-cap stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs, in addition to economic slowdown and higher interest rates. Around 42% of companies in the Russell 2000 index are reporting losses, and this percentage is even higher than during the 2008 financial crisis. Explore related questions

Title: Asian stocks are mixed after hopes for China-US talks, trade deal with the UK lift Wall Street

Shares are mixed in Asia as investors pin their hopes on weekend trade talks between China and the U.S. U.S. futures and oil prices logged modest gains HONG KONG -- Shares were mixed in Asia on Friday as investors pinned their hopes on weekend trade talks between China and the U.S. U.S. futures and oil prices logged modest gains. China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1% annual pace in April, down from 12.4% the month before. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20%, however, as President Donald Trump's steep tariff increases took effect. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 22,777.82, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3% to 3,343.38. Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials are due to meet Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland. Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekend’s talks go well, Trump said, “It could be. We’re going to see. Right now, you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145%. So we know it’s coming down.” He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be “substantive.” Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5% to 37,493.65, while the Kospi in Seoul was almost unchanged at 2,578.64. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,228.10. Taiwan's Taiex surged 1.7%. U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to 5,663.94 for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6% to 41,368.45, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to 17,928.14. Trump lauded what he called a “maxed-out trade deal” with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on U.K. products but lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies also have helped to drive the S&P 500 to within 7.8% of its all-time high set in February after it dropped nearly 20% below the mark a month ago. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1% after joining the list. It benefited from strong growth for its software and services, and it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 3.7% after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of “macroeconomic softness” and because it’s pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald’s restaurants. The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple reports on the economy Thursday came in mixed. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. But another said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected at the start of the year. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 26 cents to $60.17 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $63.13 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 145.66 Japanese yen from 145.91 yen. The euro rose to $1.1228 from $1.1220. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Public companies’ first loyalty is to shareholders — why do advertisers give them an easy time?

Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It’s late April/early May, and in any given year of the ad industry’s calendar, that means three concurrent series of events are taking place… in no particular order of importance, they are: In one, those pitching their wares on Madison Avenue make lofty promises about media quality and performance. Meanwhile, in the second series of events, the CEOs and CFOs of such outfits attempt to show Wall Street they are making good on their fiduciary obligations. In the latter, any disconnect between the former two categories is called out by disgruntled customers who can often feel they come off second-best as public companies attempt to juggle the two sets of obligations. The above dynamic played out at Digiday’s Programmatic Marketing Summit (DPMS) earlier this week. So, let’s examine the relevant Q1 results to gain perspective on this weeping and gnashing of teeth. At DPMS (May 5 to 7), Google’s recent U-turn around third-party cookies in Chrome, and its impact on the industry, was the ghost at the feast. Several participants noted how the latest development highlights Google’s lack of a clear plan and its challenges of making everyone happy, as demonstrated by its struggles with global regulators. However, some noted that clients are more focused on their own data and first-party data rather than third-party cookies, with several declining to debate Chrome’s “cookie crunch” further in self-directed sessions. With the upfront season on the horizon, the challenges of CTV and the need for transparency in targeting and measurement were more popular debates, particularly the need for transparency in show-level data to justify the prices on offer. Additionally, the need for (or lack of) differentiation between demand-side platforms and retail media networks was a common sentiment among the 300-plus attendees. Media agency participants engaged in one town hall session, conducted under Chatham House Rules, collectively said, “We come second-best once ad tech and platforms go public, then hidden fees, etc., become more common, and it feels like our trade orgs do nothing.” Simply put, many media agency attendees, particularly those from independent companies, claimed they felt used and abused, as ad tech outfits are increasingly making a play for direct relationships with their clients. This is especially the case as ad budget growth stalls, and publicly traded outfits attempt bid to maintain their stock price. Several town hall participants, including those from agency holding company outfits, expressed a desire to evaluate their DSP partnerships and explore opportunities to shift more spend to more favorable, i.e., transparent, platforms that better align with client needs. However, politics often impedes such desire, with joint business plans and holding company executives’ conflicts of interest cited as common obstacles to genuine game-changing efforts. In this environment, fee structures can escalate, from DSPs and platforms alike. “The amount of value the middlemen, with their DSP and SSP fees, are extracting greatly exceeds the value they’re providing,” said one participant. “Collectively, we’ve all let this middle layer grow; that’s imposing a giant tax with very little in return.” For many, it’s amid this dynamic that obsequious acceptance of platforms’ results is accepted. And, as recent research published by entities such as Adalytics highlights, ad tech and platforms alike require scrutiny, as advertisers’ budgets are not the only things at risk. “All of these companies are public, and if they actually did the right thing to improve and eliminate issues like MFA, which is maybe 20% to 40% of their revenue, then they’re going to lose,” noted another in the town hall. “As a public company, if they stop things like that, then I can’t imagine what would happen, just look at what happens to their price when they can’t show growth.” One participant even suggested that the industry bodies instituted to advocate for their interests may be compromised in this milieu, with several attendees noting the financial support outfits such as Google and Meta provide to entities such as the ANA and IAB, etc. “Anyone [such as a trade group] that’s pushed for open measurement, we’ve found that they [Big Tech platforms] have pushed against it,” observed another town hall participant. “I’ve never seen them come out in support of anything that makes change.” If you feel strongly about any of the issues discussed above, then feel free to get in touch – no PR pitches please. Sir Martin Sorrell’s AI bet: fear billable hours, more output-based deals. Nearly a year after he left Netflix, ad industry veteran Peter Naylor is back as a board member at ad tech business Kochava.

Title: Chinese companies bought up European ports — and now Brussels is starting to worry
URL: https://www.politico.eu/article/chinese-companies-bought-up-european-ports-and-now-brussels-is-starting-to-worry/
Time Published: 2025-05-09T02:19:00Z
Full Content:
Chinese firms own stakes in about 30 European ports, and that’s raising security concerns. AI generated Text-to-speech Europe is getting twitchy about who owns its ports, with mounting anxiety driven by the outsized footprint of Chinese firms across the bloc’s maritime gateways. Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas on Thursday told industry leaders that Europe’s ports must “reconsider security … and examine foreign presence more carefully.” It was one of the clearest signals yet from Brussels that what once was seen as a benign investment is now starting to look like a security liability. The Commission’s recent defense white paper echoed that concern by floating the idea of stricter controls on foreign ownership of “critical transport infrastructure.” That unease is mirrored in a draft paper from the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, seen by POLITICO, which calls for tougher rules in the upcoming overhaul of the EU’s foreign investment screening regulation. Neither Tzitzikostas nor the S&D mentioned China by name, but the subtext wasn’t exactly subtle. Simon Van Hoeymissen, a researcher at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defense, said the language likely nods to Beijing’s expanding hold over key European ports — from Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam to Piraeus in Greece. Chinese giants COSCO and China Merchants, as well as Hong Kong-based Hutchison now hold stakes in more than 30 terminals across the EU. ‍“The reality is clear,” said Ana Miguel Pedro, a Portuguese MEP with the center-right European People's Party. A member of the Parliament’s Seas, Rivers, Islands & Coastal Areas Intergroup, she warned that “foreign state-driven actors like Beijing are operating with a level of coordination and intent that far exceeds the fragmented response of individual countries.” Pedro argued COSCO isn’t behaving like a typical market actor but is taking orders from the Chinese Communist Party. “Its growing presence in ports is not just an economic concern,” she said. “It’s a strategic vulnerability.” The EU is starting to see it that way, too. "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s unofficial support for Russia have only heightened concerns about the security of the EU’s ports," says a recent report from the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern Studies think tank. One example of the kind of strategic entanglement the EU is now confronting is playing out in Poland, at the Gdynia Container Terminal, where Hutchison has held a stake for over 20 years. That situation could change. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants Chinese-linked companies out of the Panama Canal, Hutchison is negotiating a $23 billion sale of port properties worldwide, including 14 in Europe, to a consortium led by BlackRock and including Mediterranean Shipping Company. However, that deal hit a wall in March after Beijing intervened. What makes Gdynia especially revealing isn’t just the trade it handles — it’s what sits next door: a naval base, a shipyard, and the headquarters of Poland’s elite naval special forces, meaning that whoever runs the terminal holds a front-row seat to European and NATO military logistics and defense operations. Recognizing the strategic significance, the Polish government has listed the terminal as critical infrastructure, meaning the operator has to work closely with the government on security. This high-stakes backdrop sharpens the edge of Pedro’s warning — and underscores why the EU is now reassessing foreign involvement in its ports with renewed urgency. “If a foreign adversary exploits a vulnerability in one European port, it jeopardizes all of us,” she said. “In today’s world, we cannot afford strategic blindness while others act with full visibility and intent.” Europe has built its war-fighting plans on speeding American reinforcements to the front lines. The prospect of that not happening is throwing military mobility plans into disarray. The project aims to make it easier to move troops and equipment between Poland and the Baltic countries.

(Getty Images: PA Images/John Walton) The British and Irish Lions squad has been announced for the upcoming tour of Australia, ending months of speculation about who would be named. England's Maro Itoje will captain the British and Irish Lions on their tour of Australia later this year, as Andy Farrell announced his touring squad. The 38-strong touring party features 15 Ireland players, 13 from England, eight from Scotland and just two from Wales. That is the lowest number of Wales players to make a Lions squad since before World War II. Of those 15 Ireland players, 12 play for Dublin-based Leinster. England's lock Maro Itoje is captain on what is his third tour with the Lions. Coach Andy Farrell, the Englishman in charge of Ireland, had some desperately tough choices to make, but has selected a very strong squad to tour Down Under. Here's the list of players rugby fans will become acquainted with over the next couple of months. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 75 caps (3 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Perth, SCO | 188cm/126kg A Glasgow Warriors stalwart, Fagerson is one of the most-reliable performers in Scotland's ever-improving side. Never one to take a backward step, the west coast product is the sort of player that you want to have in your side, which is where he will likely be if there's any possibility of things getting out of hand. However, a calf injury he suffered in the lead-up to Glasgow's URC match against Zebra did put his touring participation in doubt, with Warriors coach Franco Smith telling reporters that the issue would rule him out until late June. Leinster & Ireland | 79 caps (5 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Wexford, IRE | 183cm/119kg Tadhg Furlong is one of the premier tight head props in the world, so there was never a doubt that he would be named to his third Lions touring team. Or was there? The 32-year-old missed all but one of Ireland's underwhelming Six Nations campaign and its entire series of autumn internationals with troublesome hamstring and calf injuries, playing just 33 minutes of international rugby since July last year. Battling these re-occurring injuries has been tough and there has to be an acceptance that his body is not capable of the repeat efforts it was in his 20s. But this monster of a presence in the front row has earned his spot on tour despite the lack of game time in recent months and will likely be a pillar of strength come Test time too. Bristol Bears & England | 71 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Bristol, ENG | 187cm/116kg Ellis Genge is passion personified in an England shirt — and you'd expect the Bristolian to bring all that and more Down Under with the Lions as well. A man who walks the walk as much as he talks the talk, Genge is as mobile as they come and a hugely impressive scrummager to boot, adding yet another mark to the Lions' impressive scrum stocks on this tour — in 2022 he was named World Rugby loosehead prop of the year. Genge scored one of his rare international tries against the Wallabies in Perth in 2022, albeit in a 28-30 defeat, but will have happy memories of that tour as Eddie Jones's tourists secured a 2-1 series victory. Leinster & Ireland | 75 caps (6 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 29yo, Dublin, IRE | 183cm/123kg One of the hardest-working players on the field, Leinster stalwart Andrew Porter was tireless throughout Ireland's Six Nations campaign. He hit 99 rucks — 22 more than any other prop — and made 52 tackles in the Championship — one of just two props to pass 50. Porter was named to tour with the Lions in 2021 but did not make it to South Africa after suffering a toe injury in the lead-up. He will see this as being an opportunity to make up for lost time and the missed opportunity that got away from him through no fault of his own four years ago. Edinburgh & Scotland | 42 caps (6 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Mbombela, RSA | 180cm/118kg One of Scotland's South Africa-born contingent, Schoeman has confirmed himself as one of Scotland's key performers as Gregor Townsend's boys raised themselves into the conversation. A former Springbok U20 international and ex-skipper of the Springbok schoolboys team, Schoeman made his debut for Scotland in 2021 after qualifying on residency grounds, having moved to Edinburgh in 2018. A monster at scrum time and devastating in the loose, it's easy to see why Schoeman is a fan favourite north of Hadrian's Wall and could be in with a very decent shout of wearing the number one jersey in Brisbane when the first Test comes around. Bath & England | 50 caps (3 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, London, ENG | 189cm/127kg Will Stuart had a superb Six Nations campaign for England, pushing his case with a number of assured displays. Given that the tight-head was under enormous pressure to keep his spot in the England team after a very disappointing tour of New Zealand that saw him left off the list of centrally contracted players, his resurgence has been all the more impressive. Starting at the back end of 2024, England's scrum has gone from strength-to-strength, devastating their opponents in the close confines of hand-to-hand combat that typifies the tight five. An ancient history buff who acknowledges he's happier with a lower profile than some of his front row partners, Stuart is a deserving tourist and should make his mark in the Test team. Sale Sharks & England | 49 caps (9 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 31yo, Truro, ENG | 183cm/111kg The Cornish hooker started out life in rugby as a prop before moving into the centre of the front row, where he excelled for both club and country. It's not been an easy path though, even accounting for the fact that he had former captain Jamie George to contend with for the number two jersey for England. After being one of the best hookers in the world through 2021, injury forced Cowan-Dickie to undergo neck surgery in 2023 that affected nerves in his arm for over a year. He then had a scare during a match for Sale when his heart skipped a beat … atrial fibrillation. A two-time Six Nations winner and a member of the 2019 Rugby World Cup squad that finished as runner-up, Cowan-Dickie has since given up drinking and playing Call of Duty — a game for which he was ranked as number one in the world for a short time. Leinster & Ireland | 39 caps (8 tries) | Lions tourist in 2021 27yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/111kg A tourist in 2021, initially as non-travelling cover but eventually as a full-blown replacement, Kelleher's inclusion says as much about Leinster's strength in depth as it does his own abilities. Indeed, ABC Sport had Kelleher as the best-performing hooker through the first two rounds of this year's Six Nations, before Sheehan returned from injury and was judged best for the final three weeks of the campaign. When Dan Sheehan suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2024, Kelleher was a more than ample replacement for both club and country. The two twos may as well come as a package deal and will continue to share duties at all levels. Leinster & Ireland | 32 caps (15 tries) | Lions tour debut 26yo, Dublin, IRE | 191cm/111kg The most-prolific try-scoring forward in Six Nations history, Sheehan crossed the line five times in the course of the Championship this year, including a hat-trick against Italy. The Dublin lad has had his share of setbacks in his career, including an ACL injury in 2024, but never let that get him down. His return to the Leinster side saw him score two tries against the Stormers and he stepped up to captain Ireland during this year's Six Nations in the absence of Caelan Doris. A reliable lineout thrower and busier than any in the loose, Sheehan had stamped his ticket to Australia long before the squad was eventually named. Munster & Ireland | 61 caps (12 tries) | 2 Lions Test caps (2021) 33yo, Eadestown, Co Kildare, IRE | 198cm/113kg The Munster skipper made his international bow for Ireland's senior team against Australia in 2018, helping the squad to a historic 2-1 victory. In fact, in three Tests against Australia for Ireland he has never been on the losing side. The ex-Leinster and Scarlets man will be hoping for something similar when he dons the red of the British and Irish Lions. A stellar performer who can also play in the back row if required, Beirne has twice been named in the World Rugby men's team of the year in the second row. During the Six Nations, Beirne and Andrew Porter both received abuse for an incident that saw Antoine Dupont rupture his ACL, with France coach Fabien Galthie particularly passionate. However, Beirne was adamant that there was no malice and it was just an unfortunate incident at a clean-out of a ruck. Leicester Tigers & England | 28 caps (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Boston, ENG | 201cm/118kg Following an 11-month injury lay-off, Ollie Chessum was brought straight back into England's Six Nations squad, underlining the high esteem the Lincolnshire man is held by Steve Borthwick — who should know a thing or two about being an international lock. Chessum's reaction to those back-to-back injuries to his shoulder and knee impressed his Australian coach at Leicester, Michael Cheika, who praised his attitude to rehab. A giant of a man, Chessum has been a feature of England's second row but can also be used in the back row if required. Glasgow Warriors & Scoland | 42 caps (2 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, Glasgow, SCO | 198cm/116kg Capped at almost every level by Scotland, Cummins was first selected in the senior squad by Gregor Townsend in 2017 but did not make his debut in the senior team until 2019. A long wait, but worth it for the Glaswegian, who has since made himself an integral member of the Scotland side. Cummins was in the spotlight in 2024 when he was sent off against South Africa for an innocuous-looking clean-out at a ruck. His absence from the squad through a broken arm for the 2025 edition was keenly felt for a Scotland team that somewhat stalled in their development. Saracens & England | 93 caps (8 tries) | 6 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 30yo, London, ENG | 195cm/118kg A man writing himself into the history books as one of England's all-time greats. Itoje, named skipper of England for this year's Championships, was the only man to play in every minute of every game as England managed a heartening second-place finish behind France. A man who leads by example, whose performances simply demand respect whether it's for Saracens, England, or the Lions. This will be his third Lions tour and, given he has played in every Test on the previous two tours he's been on with the Lions, expect his name to be among the first on the team sheet this time around as well and add his list to the great locks of the past, like Willie John McBride and Alun Wyn Jones. Leinster & Ireland | 93 caps (8 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Manhattan, USA | 198cm/124kg One of Ireland and Leinster's key performers in the second row over the last few years, McCarthy is a giant of a man who made his international debut against the Wallabies in 2022. He didn't have the most impactful Six Nations campaign, but has been impressive domestically for Leinster. Discipline is going to be a hot topic on tour, and one that McCarthy will need to be careful about. In a later match against the Wallabies, the New York-born, Ireland-raised lock left quite the impression on Rob Valetini in Dublin last year, when he clashed heads with the Aussie forward only to escape punishment from the officials. McCarthy was penalised with a sin-binning though for pulling back Thomas Ramos in Dublin during the Six Nations, which allowed the French to capitalise and run away with the win. It was a rare card for a team that had taken great pride in its discipline over the past few years and the sort of issue teams cannot afford to give away in tight Test matches. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (5 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland | 203cm/124kg Another monster of a lock who has been a stalwart in the Leinster and Ireland back row for a number of years. In fact, current Wallabies coach Joe Schimdt thought so highly of Ryan that he handed him his full international debut before he had suited up for Leinster, becoming the first player since 2012 to play for his country before his province. His inclusion was vindicated — he scored a try on debut. Many of the squad have leadership credentials and Ryan is no exception, captaining the Ireland under 20s to a runners-up finish at the 2016 world championship — Ireland's best-ever position. His talkative nature to referees eventually led to him being replaced, but don't expect that will stop him from muttering a few words out on the field. Leinster & Ireland | 72 caps (13 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 32yo, Bray, Co Wicklow, Ireland | 193cm/124kg A fixture of the Leinster team for more than a decade, Conan is an immense runner in the loose, who is also a furious presence in defence, earning the joint-highest number of turnovers of anyone in the Ireland squad throughout the Six Nations despite mostly playing off the bench. Comfortable anywhere in the back three, he scored tries against Scotland, Wales and France, as well as being a key factor in the second-half surge that accounted for England. It is off the bench where Conan can be most effective, acknowledging that during the week being a squad member in modern rugby is vital. Another player who has had to return from almost a year out of the game — in part due to missing the 2024 summer tour for the arrival of his first child — Conan suffered a shoulder injury in the Six Nations but he has since recovered. Sale Sharks & England | 61 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 26yo, London, ENG | 185cm/109kg There were very few players who performed as consistently well throughout the Six Nations as Tom Curry. Starting every game for England, his stunning work rate in both attack and defence were impossible to ignore by anyone watching. Perhaps most impressively though was the stunning display he produced in Cardiff, where he embarrassed his opposite number and Lions jersey frontrunner Jac Morgan in a devastating display, all in front of coach Andy Farrell. Don't back against him adding to his three Lions caps despite the impossible strength in depth of the back row across the British Isles. Saracens & England | 42 caps (6 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps (2021) 27yo, Redhill, ENG | 183cm/107kg Another of the stellar England backrow unit who simply doesn't know what fatigue is — or at least plays that way. No England player had more carries than Earl through the Six Nations, with the Saracens man taking all 63 of them into contact — second only to Blair Kinghorne in his propensity to hit tacklers. Earl also made more tackles than any other England player, no mean feat given how the entire loose forward contingent hunted in packs. He also stole five balls at the breakdown, equal most of all England players with Ben Curry, and made a turnover tackle as well. You know what you're going to get if you pick Ben Earl, a whirlwind of power and willingness. Ospreys & Wales | 24 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 25yo, Swansea, WAL | 182cm/105kg By the end of the Six Nations, Wales skipper Jac Morgan looked absolutely exhausted. That's understandable. He had played every minute of Wales's sorry campaign, making more tackles (92) than anyone else in the tournament, hitting more rucks than anyone bar Gregory Alldritt and doing it all while carrying his misfiring teammates on his back. It would not have gone unnoticed that Morgan had his worst display of the tournament in the humiliation at the hands of England in Cardiff, where he was comprehensively outplayed by his direct opponent for a Lions starting berth, Ben Curry. Wales has a fine heritage when it comes to the Lions, and although the number of tourists from Wales is paltry compared to recent years, in Morgan they have at least provided one of the best. Northampton Saints & England | 1 cap (2 tries) | Lions tour debut 20yo, Banbury, ENG | 186cm/100kg Get used to this name, because it's one you're going to be hearing a lot of in rugby circles over the next few years. Bruising and combative back row forwards are 10-a-penny in rugby union, and yet there is still something a little bit special about this youngster. Having captained England at under 18 and under 20 level — the latter of which saw him lift the 2024 under 20 Rugby World Championship — Pollock roared into senior team contention after starring for England A against Australia in London in November last year. He made his senior debut off the bench in Cardiff as England romped to a belting victory against their arch nemesis, with Pollock scoring twice. His display against Leinster in Dublin for the Saints showed that he loves the limelight, laying down tackles on his senior rivals and scoring a wonderful try that embarrassed Sam Prendergast to such an extent that it may have been the deciding moment that saw him missing the trip. Every tour needs a bolter and Pollock has proven with his stellar performances this year that he is more than up to the task. Leinster & Ireland | 73 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Wicklow, IRE | 186cm/103kg Despite the name suggesting otherwise, Josh van der Flier is not one of the South African exiles playing in Europe. In fact, he's of Dutch stock, and was born and raised in Wicklow south of Dublin. A keen thinker — he has a masters degree from Dublin Business School — van der Flier has been one of Ireland's best for a number of years, winning the World Rugby player of the year award in 2022 and being named player of the series for the 2024 November internationals. Nobody in an Ireland shirt made more tackles than him in the Six Nations, nor hit as many rucks as he did. Leinster & Ireland | 43 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 33yo, Great Barrier Island, NZ | 175cm/80kg A player who cut his teeth playing for Taranaki in the National Provincial Championships across the ditch, Jamison Gibson-Park was considered one of the rising stars of New Zealand rugby. As a 20-year-old he was selected for the Māori All Blacks in 2012, before going on to play Super Rugby for the Blues and Hurricanes. Staying in New Zealand though, was not Gibson-Park's destiny, as he would move to Dublin in 2016, becoming eligible for Ireland on residency grounds in 2019. He made his Ireland debut in 2020 and has since been awarded citizenship. A shoe-in for the number nine jersey, Gibson-Park started the Six Nations brightly against England, but frankly dropped off as the tournament progressed. The Lions will want and need him on top form if they are to succeed Down Under. Northampton Saints & England | 23 caps (4 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Maidstone, ENG | 178cm/89kg An exciting, running scrum half, Alex Mitchell was involved in five tries for England in the Six Nations, second most behind Northampton teammate Tommy Freeman. And yet it is his form for Northampton that has undoubtedly got the 27-year-old Kent man on the plane. Against Leinster last week he was exceptional, leading the Saints to an unlikely European final. With Northampton providing four tourists, expect Mitchell to use his relationship with Fin Smith on the midweek team to great effect and work to get into that Test team. Gloucester & Wales | 60 caps (10 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Treorchy, WAL | 180cm/86kg There's no hiding from Wales's abysmal Six Nations campaign, but among the ashes of a once fine rugby nation, Tomos Williams still flickered. From the former mining region of the Rhondda Fawr Valley, Williams will be upholding Welsh pride on tour alongside his country skipper Jac Morgan. Given Wales's fine history with the Lions, there's no wonder he admitted to shedding a tear when he heard he had made the squad. A darting runner who honed his speed of foot and mind on the sevens circuit, the ex-Cardiff man will relish having a pack in front of him that's not going backwards at a rate of knots when he suits up for the Lions. Bath & Scotland | 85 caps (415pts, 9 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 32yo, Stirling, SCO | 182cm/87kg Mercurial. Established. Flashy. Take your pick of adjectives to describe Finn Russell. But one thing you can be sure of is his will to win. In a Six Nations tournament filled with young pretenders for the Lions 10 shirt, Russell could be considered a safe pair of hands — although the veteran did have his moments with some careless play against Ireland and some terrible goal-kicking against England. Despite those lapses Scotland has, under his guidance, developed one of the best attacking back lines in the world, albeit one that did not quite have the cutting edge he or coach Gregor Townsend would have hoped for during the Northern Hemisphere spring. He is the top scorer in the Premiership for Bath, with 148 points (five penalties, 59 conversions and three tries), which should be an indication his ability off the tee has not been dulled. With even more weapons at his disposal and a brutally strong pack ahead of him, what could Russell do for the Lions? We may not have to wonder too long. Northampton Saints & England | 11 caps (29pts) | Lions tour debut 22yo, Warwick, ENG | 178cm/87kg Just a couple of months ago nobody would have thought Fin Smith would be anything other than deserving of a cursory mention when it came to the British and Irish Lions squad — perhaps only in passing as reference to his grandfather, Tom Elliot, the Scotland prop who played eight tour games but no Tests on the 1955 Lions tour of South Africa. Yet, after a superb Six Nations and a series of magical performances for the Saints in both the Premiership and European Cup competition, young Fin forced himself into the conversation. Having been named in the Premiership team of the season and the Players Association players' player of the year in 2023/24 should have been a clue as to the trajectory his career was on, but managing to convert that domestic form into the international stage was something else. His performances up against fellow young gun, Sam Prendergast would have made a particular impression on the selection team just last week when the youngster helped guide the Saints to a hugely unexpected victory over Leinster at the Aviva Stadium in the European Cup semifinal. Harlequins & England | 44 caps (14 tries, 314pts) | Lions tourist in 2021 26yo, Manila, PHI | 175cm/82kg One of the most thrilling broken-play players in world rugby, Marcus Smith should, perhaps, feel a little fortunate that he has been included in this Lions squad. A year ago you'd have said the Harlequins man was a nailed-on starter for both the Lions and England, but with the rise of Fin Smith and a shift to fullback at international level, Marcus's stock has fallen. And yet, despite a dramatic drop-off in club form of late, there are few players in the world who can incite as much excitement as Smith does when he has his hands on the ball. Whether he plays at 15 or 10 on tour, given the amount of ball the Lions will be expected to have, he could make hay against any opponent, with his versatility potentially making him an ideal bench player for the Test team. Connacht & Ireland | 65 caps (18 tries) | 1 Lions Test cap 35yo, Ōtāhuhu, NZ | 178cm/102kg It's easy to think of Bundee Aki as another of New Zealand's rugby refugees now plying his trade in Europe, but the 35-year-old veteran is so much more than that. Moving from the Chiefs fresh after winning Super Rugby to unfashionable Connacht out on Ireland's windswept west coast, Aki made the Westerners a genuine title force and even helped them win the Pro12 in 2015. As Ireland has surged, so has Aki, winning two grand slams and three Six Nations titles in total since he made his debut in 2017, after completing his three years of residency. Aki was criticised earlier in his career after admitting that he moved to Ireland primarily to play international rugby, but has embraced life so comprehensively in Galway that he has become a citizen in 2024. "I love the people, I love the culture … There's not a bad word I can speak about Ireland," Aki said upon being made a citizen. Saracens & England | 65 caps (131 points, 18 tries) | 5 Lions Test caps (2017, 2021) 32yo, Croydon, ENG | 178cm/83kg He's listed as a centre, but in reality Elliot Daly can play just about anywhere in the back line. Immense under the high ball and a brutal attacking force, Daly will likely slot in at fullback as often as he will in the centres. His enormous boot, capable of kicking penalty goals from beyond half way, may also prove vital. Another of the backs in this squad to be in the incredibly small group of players who have played both for and against the touring side. In 2023, Daly played for the Barbarians who took on the touring Lions in Hong Kong. Since then he has gone on to play five Tests, including all three in the dramatic drawn series against New Zealand in 2021. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 31yo, Leith, SCO | 186cm/102kg Scotland to England to South Africa to Scotland and now the Lions — Huw Jones's rugby life has already taken him plenty of places around the world. Born in Scotland, Jones was educated in England before moving to South Africa, where he got his first taste of professional rugby with Western Province and then the Stormers in Super Rugby. The call of home was always there though and he moved to the Glasgow Warriors where, either side of a season at Harlequins, he has remained ever since. A hard-running and skilful ball carrier whose ability to unpick a defence with lines few can see let alone defend against, Jones has been one of the stars in a backline full of them for the Scots in recent years — particularly in partnership with former Australian Sione Tuipulotu. Although he has not played since the Six Nations on account of an ankle injury, he had plenty of credit in the bank to keep his spot in the squad. Leinster & Ireland | 67 caps (77 points, 15 tries) | Lions tour debut 30yo, Blackrock, Co Dublin, IRE | 185cm/102kg A fleet-of-foot centre who has been a fixture in the Ireland set-up since 2016, Gary Ringrose is a multiple winner at club and international level. One of the most skilled ball-handlers in the game, Ringrose has the ability to unlock defences with a hint of a swerve as much as a powerful fend. Being sent off for a high tackle against Wales — and a subsequent three-match ban — limited his international appearances this season. But there was little concern that Andy Farrell would leave one of his most dependable backs at home. Glasgow Warriors & Scotland | 58 caps (23 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Melbourne, AUS | 179cm/104kg The Melbourne Rebels are, sadly, no more, but they will be represented in some small way at least on this year's Lions tour. A graduate of the Rebels set-up, Sione Tuipulotu felt like his Lions dream was over after he suffered a pectoral injury in January that has kept him out of action until May. Fortunately, Andy Farrell had already seen enough from this adopted Scot, who qualified for the tartan army on account of his grandmother. And it's a fitting reward for what has been a stunning rise for the Australian-born centre, who has inarguably been the heart and soul of Scotland's rise into genuine contenders in recent years as captain. In November, Tuipulotu clashed with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, so that might be one to keep an eye on Down Under. Northampton & England | 20 caps (7 tries) | Lions tour debut 24yo, Oxford, ENG | 188cm/92kg Tommy Freeman made history during the 2025 Six Nations, becoming the first Englishman to score a try in each round of fixtures — even if the legitimacy of the try awarded against Scotland at Twickenham is justifiably contested north of the border. One of the rising stars of England rugby, Freeman combines powerful running with electric speed and finishing ability — everything you could ask for from a winger, in other words. Overall he has 16 tries from 17 starts for Northampton, and five in nine for England this season. He made his starting debut for England at Lang Park in 2022 under Eddie Jones, perhaps he'll make his Lions debut there too. Connacht & Ireland | 28 caps (12 tries) | Lions tour debut 27yo, Canberra, AUS | 188cm/89kg Mack Hansen suffered an ankle injury that will force him to miss the last few rounds of the United Rugby Championship, which must have meant he feared for his spot on this year's Lions tour, especially given the impressive form of Scotland's Darcy Graham. He needn't have worried, despite professing to being "speechless" for the first time in his life. Despite not having the most prolific of Six Nations tournaments, the Australian-born winger with an Irish mother has been a key member of Andy Farrell's back line for Ireland and was, if not a certainty for selection, a pretty safe bet. Hansen was one of the first players interviewed after the squad was announced, telling the event at the O2 via Zoom that he had just been about to go for a swim on Ireland's west coast. In May. You can take the boy out of Australia … Leinster & Ireland | 40 caps (17 tries) | Lions tour debut 32yo, Nelson, NZ | 188cm/101kg Not many players will have played both against the British and Irish Lions as well as for them, but that's a rare honour that James Lowe will likely achieve this tour. Lowe first played against the Lions in 2017, when he appeared at fullback for the Māori All Blacks in their 32-10 defeat against the Lions in Rotorua. That was the last of Lowe's eight caps for the Māori. Fast forward eight years and Lowe has 40 international appearances for Ireland under his belt and a reputation as one of the most dangerously powerful wingers in the world. Edinburgh & Scotland | 49 caps (32 tries) | 3 Lions Test caps 29yo, George, RSA | 193cm/106kg Nothing short of a try-scoring machine he may be, but Duhan van der Merwe does have his critics, summarised succinctly by Rugby World this week: "Some may argue that Duhan van de Merwe doesn’t offer enough ‘without’ the ball," wrote columnist and author Paul Williams. "But that’s much like criticising a nuclear weapon because all it does is blow things up." It's a fair enough statement. This monstrous winger tore up the record books as a kid in the Western Cape, earning a spot as part of the South Africa squad that finished runners-up at the 2014 Junior World Championship. A move to Montpellier in 2016 didn't really work out, but shifting north to Edinburgh proved the trick, with the club signing him despite question marks over a hip injury. Injury is clouding him in the lead-up to this Lions Tour, an ankle injury requiring surgery has kept him out the Edinburgh line up since March. Leinster & Ireland | 46 caps (13 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Dublin, IRE | 185cm/92kg A Paris 2024 Olympian with the Ireland Sevens team, Hugo Keenan displays all the skills needed to break lines and tackles at will in the 15s game as well. Equally capable at fullback or the wing, Keenan is super capable under the high ball and is very dangerous in broken play — kicking to him is ill-advised. Another of Leinster's bevvy of stars who will line up for the Lions — 12 of the touring squad play in the blue of Leinster. Stade Toulousain & Scotland | 60 caps (146 pts, 16 tries) | Lions tour debut 28yo, Edinburgh, SCO | 193cm/107kg The stand out 15 of the home nations during the past Six Nations, nothing would stop Blair Kinghorn being named in this squad. That's despite him likely to miss at least the first tour match in Perth against the Force due to Toulouse's Top14 finals commitments. The final of the Top14 — of which Toulouse are runaway leaders of at the moment — takes place on the same day as the Lions' first match in Australia, June 28. But given Kinghorn's skill set — barring scrumhalf he can reasonably be expected to slot in anywhere in the back line should the need arise — there was no doubt that the ex-Edinburgh man would make the trip, no matter how delayed he is. The British and Irish Lions will play nine matches in Australia, culminating the three Tests in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney in late July/early August. Prior to their departure, the Lions will face Argentina at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. This will be the third time in recent years that the Lions have faced a national team as part of their pre-tour preparations, following matches against Japan at Murrayfield in 2021 (Lions won 28-10) and against Argentina in Cardiff in 2005 (a 25-25 draw). The Lions have also met France at the Parc des Princes in 1989 (Lions won 29-27), a Rest of the World team at Cardiff Arms Park in 1986 (Lions won 15-7) and the Barbarians at Twickenham in 1977 (Lions won 23-14). There were also unofficial matches against Cardiff and Wales at the old Arms Park in 1951 and 1955 after the tourists had returned. The tour proper though, starts in Perth. ABC Sport will be live blogging every match of the British and Irish Lions Tour, including all three Tests.

Title: Briefly Noted

Time Published: 2025-05-09T00:25:08Z
Full Content:
After 35 years with Ariel Investments, effective May 1, 2025, John P. Miller is retiring from his role as portfolio manager for the Ariel Fund. RiverNorth/Oaktree High Income Fund (RNHIX) won the 2025 LSEG Lipper Fund Award for Best General Bond Fund for the five-year period ended November 30, 2024. RiverNorth is a closed-end fund specialist that has collaborated with other “A” managers on several funds. The fund embodies three strategies. RiverNorth manages the Tactical Closed-End Fund Strategy, and Oaktree manages the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies. Oaktree tactically manages the allocation between the High Yield Bond and Senior Loan Strategies based on both market opportunities and the risk-reward trade-offs between the two asset classes. The fund has returned 4.2% APR since inception, while the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index clocked in at 1.6%. Lazard US Equity Concentrated Portfolio will undergo a reverse stock split, 1:3, effective May 16, 2025. BlackRock has filed for a new active infrastructure ETF, iShares Active Infrastructure ETF, which will likely launch by the end of June. The ETF, which does not yet list a ticker or fees, is to be managed by Balfie Morrison, who leads the BlackRock Global Listed Infrastructure fund, which is currently only offered in Australia. The Australian fund launched in 2007 and has, since inception, trounced its benchmark (11.5% APR vs 8.75% for a Developed Core Infrastructure 50/50 index). Mr. Morrison became co-manager of that fund in September 2023. Reportedly, the new ETF will be substantially similar to that fund. If so, expect a bit over 50% US and a bit over 50% utilities. BlackRock also offers the passive, five-star $2.2 billion iShares US Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity fund reopened to new investors effective April 1. The fund was soft closed since May 2020, when it hit its target capacity. The decision to reopen the fund is due to significant redemptions in recent years, due to the sentiment of emerging markets and underperformance. Effective May 1, 2025, the expense ratio for Janus Henderson Corporate Bond ETF has dropped to 0.20% for at least 12 months. BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund will be converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF and the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, respectively, on Sept. 12. The expense ratios will be 0.4%, and both funds will retain their current objectives and managers and maintain “substantially similar” strategies. GQG US Equity ETF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund in registration. Under normal circumstances, the ETF will invest in U.S companies. Rajiv Jain, Brian Kersmanc, and Sudarshan Murthy are the portfolio managers; Siddharth Jain is the Deputy Portfolio Manager. Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Reductions and/or Expense Reimbursements will be 0.49%. On or about May 9, 2025, Lazard International Equity Advantage Portfolio will convert to an ETF, the Lazard International Dynamic Equity ETF. On or about November 7, 2025, Morgan Stanley Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund will be rechristened as Morgan Stanley Income Opportunities Fund and relaunched as an active ETF. Pending shareholder approval in June, the Morgan Stanley Mortgage Securities Trust will relaunch as the Eaton Vance Mortgage Opportunities ETF. On June 20, 2025, the OTG Latin America Fund will become the OTG Latin America ETF. On April 3, Vanguard Short Duration Bond ETF, an actively managed exchange-traded fund, launched. It offers diversified exposure to primarily short-duration U.S. investment-grade bonds, including structured products exposure, like asset-backed securities, with the flexibility to invest in below investment-grade debt to seek additional yield. The fund has an expense ratio of 15 bps. Vanguard Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF, Vanguard Total Treasury ETF, and Vanguard Government Securities Active ETF are in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager of the inflation-protected securities and total treasury ETFs. John Madziyire, CFA, Nathan Persons, and Brian W. Quigley, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of the government securities active ETF. The Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF will have total annual expenses of .05%; the Total Treasury ETF will have total annual expenses of .03%; and the Government Securities Active ETF will have total annual expenses of .10%. Virtus IG Public & Private Credit ETF is in registration. David Albrycht, CFA; Zachary Szyndlar, CFA; Ryan Jungk, CFA; George Goudelias; and John Wu, CFA will manage the fund. The plan is to provide diversification by allocating the fund’s investments among various sectors of these markets, including, without limitation: investment grade corporate bonds; mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), including commercial MBS and residential MBS; asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including private credit. Expenses have not been stated. Effective on or about November 21, 2025, the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF becomes the iShares U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness Aware Active ETF. “Readiness Aware.” Your guess is as good as ours. Effective May 2, 2025, the Calamos Alternative Nasdaq® & Bond ETF will become the Calamos Nasdaq® Equity & Income ETF. Carillon Chartwell Small Cap fund will be reorganized into the Chartwell Small Cap Growth fund on or about October 17. The following name changes will take effect on June 2, 2025: My first impulse was: “more babble.” Maybe not. Here’s their explanation. The iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF’s Underlying Index is an optimized index designed to maximize exposure to positive ESG characteristics while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to the MSCI USA Index. In addition to its name change, effective with the rebalance at the end of May 2025, the Index Provider for iShares ESG Optimized MSCI USA ETF has updated the index methodology to require that the Underlying Index have a minimum ESG score of at least 20% better than that of the MSCI USA Index … On June 25, 2025, Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund will be (new word for me) “repositioned” as the ESG-lite Janus Henderson International Dividend Fund. At base, they will loosen ESG strictures on the portfolio while not entirely abandoning “consideration” of ESG factors that are “financially material.” The advisor to ONEFUND, an S&P 500 index fund? Effective immediately, the adviser’s name has changed from ONEFUND, LLC to CYBER HORNET ETFS. Presumably from Michael Saylor’s feverish, “Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.” And presumably, they’re staking their future on their second fund, the CYBER HORNET S&P500 Bitcoin 75/25 Strategy ETF. Effective May 1, 2025, Roundhill Small Cap 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF will be renamed Roundhill Russell 2000 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF. The Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund has been renamed the Schwab Prime Advantage Money Fund. All other aspects of the fund remain the same. (Thanks, Don G.!) Effective April 4, 2025, the WisdomTree PutWrite Strategy Fund (PUTW) changed its name (now, the WisdomTree Equity Premium Income Fund), principal investment strategies, and ticker symbol. On June 26, 2025, (a) Chip and I will be in Sweden, and (b) the WisdomTree Japan Hedged SmallCap Equity Fund will become the WisdomTree Japan Opportunities Fund. But wait! There’s more. It’s going to be an index fund with a very distinctive index. Among the new fund’s other quirks are the following allocation bands: 0-45% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that are strategic holdings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that provide a high “total shareholder yield” 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of Japanese companies that have a low valuation ratio but favorable earnings and dividend growth characteristics. 15-33% of the Index will be allocated to securities of companies that have exposures to thematic opportunities from developments in the geopolitical space, technology trends, and macroeconomic conditions. Within this latter category, 25-50% of the stocks will be companies positioned “to benefit from geopolitical considerations,” 5-25% from central bank movements, and 5-25% from cool new tech. The Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF and Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF were closed and liquidated on April 29, 2025. On April 25, 2025, Foundry Partners Small Cap Value Fund merged with North Square Small Cap Value Fund. On May 9, 2025, the Gotham Enhanced 500 Plus Fund and Gotham Hedged Core Fund merged with and into the Gotham Index Plus Fund. Effective April 11, 2025, the Hartford Schroders Sustainable International Core Fund was liquidated. On April 17, 2025, the Mast Global Battery Recycling & Production ETF was shut down. The Neuberger Berman International Small Cap Fund will experience termination and liquidation on or about May 28, 2025. (sigh. That means it will miss my birthday party again this year.) On April 29, 2025, the Ramirez Government Money Market Fund was liquidated. On May 16, 2025, the Range Global LNG Ecosystem Index ETF will be liquidated. Sprucegrove International Equity Fund was liquidated on May 1, 2025. On or about May 30, 2025, the Tuttle Capital Self Defense Index ETF (not the silliest of the advisor’s offerings, IMHO) will be liquidated, terminated, and otherwise struck defenseless. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher after President Trump unveiled a new trade agreement with the U.K. It is the first deal announced since last month's suspension of "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement will keep the 10% broad tariff in place, but will give the U.K. concessions on automobile and steel industry tariffs in exchange for "increased market access" for U.S. agricultural, industrial, and chemical products in Britain. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% on Thursday. The Dow industrials also closed 0.6% higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.1%. Shares of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) surged 14.1%, gaining the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Thursday. The company, which also provides body cameras and other products for military and law enforcement, posted better-than-expected sales and profits for the first quarter and boosted its full-year guidance. Axon touted strong growth for its software and services segment, highlighting robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) policing systems. Epam Systems (EPAM) also surpassed consensus estimates with its quarterly results, and shares of the digital engineering and cloud-based software provider jumped 12.9%. Growth in IT services revenue, AI-related demand, and strategic partnerships helped underpin the strong performance. EPAM also increased its full-year sales outlook and announced that its current chief revenue officer would take the reins as CEO later this year. Enphase Energy (ENPH) shares advanced 12.2% after the energy technology firm launched a plug-and-play solar energy system in Germany. The new product is designed for users who live in apartments or have limited roof space. It can also be used in off-grid locations such as cabins, campsites, and mobile homes. With Thursday's gains, Enphase stock staged a partial recovery from losses posted late last month after its quarterly results fell short of expectations. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder and other online dating services, sank 9.6%, posting the S&P 500's weakest daily performance. The company reported a year-over-year decline in paying users across its platforms, including the dating sites Hinge and OkCupid. Furthermore, Match said it would cut its workforce by 13% in an effort to cut costs as it navigates challenges related to user engagement. Fortinet (FTNT) shares fell 8.4% in the wake of the cybersecurity firm's quarterly earnings release. Although its first-quarter adjusted profits came in ahead of consensus forecasts, revenue for the period missed the mark, and Fortinet issued underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and the full year. Despite the relatively cautious outlook, Fortinet maintains a strong leadership position in the global firewall market. Shares of drug wholesaler and pharmaceutical solutions provider Cencora (COR) lost 6.8% on Thursday, reversing the strong gains posted by the stock in the prior session following a strong earnings report. Notwithstanding the strong quarterly performance, Cencora noted that it faces challenging growth comparisons for GLP-1 weight-loss products along with softness in clinical trial activity and its specialty logistics business.

Title: Stocks Rise After Trump Announces UK Trade Deal

US stocks rose Thursday after the US and UK announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs and restrictions between the two countries. The S&P 500 rose 32.66 points, or 0.6%, to 5,663.94, marking its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.48 points, or 0.6%, to 41,368.45. The Nasdaq composite rose 189.98 points, or 1.1%, to 17,928.14. Stocks got a boost after President Trump gave potentially encouraging updates on upcoming talks with China, but some of the gains faded late in the day, the AP reports. Bitcoin jumped above $101,000, crude oil prices climbed, and the price of gold eased back as investors felt less need for safety. Treasury yields jumped on bets that more trade deals with other countries would mean the Federal Reserve won't need to cut interest rates as sharply in order to prop up the economy. Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a "maxed-out trade deal" with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on UK products but would lower taxes on Rolls-Royces and other UK automobiles in exchange for greater access in the UK market for US beef, ethanol, and other products. Treasury yields jumped on bets that more trade deals with other countries would mean the Federal Reserve won't need to cut interest rates as sharply in order to prop up the economy. Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a "maxed-out trade deal" with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on UK products but would lower taxes on Rolls-Royces and other UK automobiles in exchange for greater access in the UK market for US beef, ethanol, and other products. Asked Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs if this weekend's talks between US and Chinese officials go well, Trump said: "It could be. We're going to see. Right now, you can't get any higher. It's at 145. So we know it's coming down." He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be "substantive." Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from US companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. It's back within 7.3% after dropping nearly 20% below the mark a month ago. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras, and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1% after it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 3.8% after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. Molson Coors, though, warned of uncertainty amid a "volatile" global macroeconomic environment when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of "macroeconomic softness" and because it's pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald's restaurants.

HELLO and welcome to The Stranger’s 2025 SIFF Guide! We have returned to our tradition of “attempting to watch every single SIFF film,” and are proud/exhausted to say that we made it through every single screener that was made available to us, so that you, dear reader, could be a little more informed about what rules, what sucks, what is beautiful, and what is incomprehensibly boring. It’s our labor of love, though, to be able to do this. Seattle International Film Festival has brought independent cinema to Seattle for over half a century, and with funding and movie theaters becoming more scarce (please, I beg of you, someone with money, turn the old Broadway Rite Aid back into a theater—the sign is still there and everything!), independent film is more important than ever to celebrate. Below, you’ll find a handy key. UNSCREENED means we weren’t able to obtain a screener by the time of printing, even though we asked a lot, and really nicely. Of the 100-plus we did see, you’ll find we RECOMMEND 32 of them, while there are another 18 we insist you DON’T MISS (threat). But you do you—one person’s “gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy” is another person’s “supernatural thriller starring a dog,” as they say. So dig in! Rating Key: ★ Recommended Don't Miss Unscreened 1-800-ON-HER-OWN USA, 2024 (78 min), Dir. Dana Flor Ani DiFranco has lived a fascinating life. She’s self-released more than 20 albums, he’s an ardent activist, using her platform to speak out against homophobia, racism, and other inequalities. She’s worked with orgs that make music education accessible to kids, spoken out against predatory major labels, and collaborated with everyone from Prince to Cyndi Lauper. So it’s unfortunate to hear that Dana Flor’s DiFranco documentary 1-800-ON-HER-OWN is “a pedestrian musician documentary” (New York Times) and “a snooze” (The Hollywood Reporter). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING 40 Acres Canada, 2024 (113 min), Dir. R.T. Thorne It’s a classic premise: a pandemic sparks war, famine follows, and resources rule all. By post-apocalyptic standards, the Freeman family farm is thriving until a band of cannibals arrives. The first act is fun, but the cannibals fall flat as soon as we get a good look at them. Instead of standing on their own characterization, they play more like inconsistently styled homages to other horror-movie cannibals. With no background or motivation, it would be easy to miss the allegory to white colonial violence if the movie weren’t called 40 Acres, if the son didn’t sleep under a Fred Hampton poster, if the film didn’t prominently feature a book report on The Proletarian’s Pocketbook, etc. The cannibals feel more like an interruption of the family’s discussions of—rather than part of a story about—race and colonialism. I would have loved to see that movie. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY April Georgia, 2024 (134 min), Dir. Dea Kulumbegashvili After a baby dies during delivery, the father calls the police. The hospital launches an inquest. Nina, the hospital’s leading OBGYN, who delivered the baby, is an expert called in for every complicated birth. But Nina has a secret, which the aggrieved father knows: “I know you give abortions in the villages,” he says. “You’re a murderer.” I assumed a film about abortions in rural Georgia, a country where the procedure is restricted, would be sad. April is scary. It’s a mostly quiet story punctuated by shocking moments, and the menace of masculine control hangs heavy over this film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, SIFF Film Center May 17) VIVIAN McCALL Auction France, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Pascal Bonitzer Pascal Bonitzer’s Auction, is based on a true story, in which an auctioneer discovers an authentic Egon Schiele painting (exciting!), but learns that it went missing in 1939 after being confiscated by the Nazis (oh no). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 18) MEGAN SELING Baby Doe USA, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Jessica Earnshaw It’s easy to assume you’d never not know you were pregnant, all the way up until you gave birth. “How would that even happen?” is a question I myself have asked. But, like most assumptions, it’s worth deeper consideration. Gail Ritchey is a mother, grandmother, wife, and devoted church member from a conservative Christian community in rural Ohio who was leading a very ordinary life until police knocked on her door to question her about fetal remains found in 1993, leading to her arrest for murder. Her children and husband (who is the father of her living children, as well as the deceased) are understandably shocked, but stand by her side as they navigate the psychology of pregnancy dissociation and denial, and how aspects like religion, shame, resources, and politics might lead to unimaginable circumstances. Baby Doe is an empathetic look at a very complex topic, something the legal system is rarely equipped to understand or accommodate. It’s heavy stuff, but I do think it’s mind-opening and worth viewing. (AMC Pacific Place May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) EMILY NOKES ★ The Balconettes France, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Noémie Merlant In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, star Noémie Merlant’s directorial debut, tensions and libidos run high as Marseille is caught in a sweltering heat wave. The titular “Balconettes” are Nicole (Sanda Codreanu), a sexually frustrated novelist; Elise (Merlant), a glamorous actress retreating from the overzealous attentions of her possessive husband; and Ruby (Souhelia Yacoub), a carefree camgirl. When the roommates flirt with the mysterious man on the balcony across from their building, a series of devastating events is set in motion. What starts out as a feminist take on Rear Window (starring Merlant as the consummate Hitchcock blonde) soon shifts into a surrealist revenge fantasy full of bright colors and unapologetic physicality: titties hanging out, farts, orgasms, etc. The effect is something like an episode of Broad City as directed by Pedro Almodóvar. One thing’s for sure: You’ll never look at a rocking chair the same way again. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 19) JULIANNE BELL BAR USA, 2025 (89 min), Dir. Don Hardy It’s said the BAR (Beverage Alcohol Resource) 5-day program is like the PhD of mixology—difficult to pass, expensive to attend, and, according to the attendees, a life-changing experience packed with education and camaraderie. BAR follows a handful of the program’s attendees on their journey through spirit schooling and mastercraft. Yes, there is a certain overproof rizz that comes with some BAR personalities, but the film’s at its best when waxing about “being in the people business.” During a particularly heartfelt diversity workshop, a speaker put it best: “Everything we do…must be truly grounded in making sure that people are, at the very least, respected, considered, thought about, and then hopefully made to feel happy and comfortable.” Cheers to that. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Beef Spain, 2025 (85 min), Dir. Ingride Santos Lati is a young Malian woman living with her family in Barcelona. Her father is dead, and her mother wants her to be a good Muslim, but she “only dreams of becoming a famous rapper.” Fuck yes! Sold. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING ★ Beginnings Denmark, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jeanette Nordahl The complexity of love, the intimacy of caretaking, and the fragility of “normal” come together in a quiet, painful dance in this unflinching Danish drama. Ane and Thomas, on the brink of divorce, seem to hate each other the way only people who love each other can, until Ane’s sudden stroke detonates their unhappy-but-familiar equilibrium. It’s a bleak ordeal through the relentless, pitiless humiliation of failing health and forced dependency. It’s also a captivating, compassionate story of survival and suffering that resists cheap emotional shots, carried by some devastatingly amazing acting. Don’t watch this on a first date… but do watch it. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) FOX ALLISON ★ Between Goodbyes USA, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Jota Mun Mieke is a Danish woman, adopted from South Korea as a baby. Having lost both her adoptive parents, she’s getting to know her birth family, who still reside in Korea. The documentary focuses on that complex, fragile relationship, and we, the viewers, are invited into some uncomfortably intimate, vulnerable moments as they wade through decades of love and heartbreak. Mieke’s parents spent every day of her life loving her and wishing to find her, but they struggle to come to terms with core things like her Danishness and her queerness. The language barrier between them stands in for all the barriers built from regret, time, and distance. The family’s story, though, is far from over. They’ll keep working on their relationships long after the cameras stop rolling. (AMC Pacific Place May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Billy Canada (Québec), 2024 (107 min), Dir. Lawrence Côté-Collins It’s an intriguing premise: After her fellow filmmaker, Billy Poulin, goes to prison for murder, Lawrence Côté-Collins stitches together clips from hundreds of hours of Poulin’s personal video footage to form a portrait of sorts of his undiagnosed and untreated schizophrenia. As she updates Poulin on her progress through letters and phone calls, Poulin begins to understand the scope of his illness. But Billy falls frustratingly short as Côté-Collins inserts herself into the narrative—and glosses over Poulin’s victims and the impact of his crimes—in a way that’s more opportunistic than sincere. (SIFF Film Center May 16–17; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING Bitter Gold Chile, 2024 (83 min), Dir. Juan Olea Each day, Pacífico (Francisco Melo) drives his workers from a desolate desert road in Northern Chile to an abandoned mine nearby. He’s searching not only for gold, but a way out for his teenage daughter, Carola (Katalina Sánchez). But after he fires his drunk of an employee, Humberto, everything goes terribly wrong. This tightly plotted, tense neo-Western is about how, as one miner puts it, “when there’s gold, the devil shows.” For clever Carlona, that evil is not only simple greed, but the patriarchal structures that define her dust-covered, hardscrabble world. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, May 22) VIVIAN McCALL ★ BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions USA, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Kahlil Joseph If you like your Blackness bold, creative, eccentric, complex, profound, mind-blowing, thought-provoking (hell, if you just like Blackness), Kahlil Joseph’s “cinematic installation” BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions is your flick. A mixtape of images, histories, and imagined futures, it refuses easy description like it refuses the white gaze. From Du Bois to Raekwon, Million Man March to Ghanaian streets, encyclopedias to encrypted futures—this is Blackness remixed and re-centered. Joseph invites us into a world where history flashes like strobe lights (epileptics beware), and meaning pulses through image, sound, and silence. This isn’t a movie. It’s an experience. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18–19) MARCUS HARRISON GREEN ★ Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story Ireland, 2024 (100 min), Dir. Sinéad O’Shea Sinéad O’Shea’s new documentary chronicles the life of Irish novelist Edna O’Brien and her ascent from a whimsical child in rural Ireland to a trailblazing writer unafraid to challenge the Roman Catholic attitudes and shame toward sex. Consisting of archival footage and contemporary interviews with O’Brien (just before her passing last year), the film doesn’t just document an interesting subject, but does so with great care and humanity, capturing her fearless spirit and rebellious attitude. Immediately after watching the film, I frantically searched for used copies of The Country Girls trilogy on eBay, so I’d call the movie a success. Some of my favorite Edna-isms in the film include: “Women don’t just need the vote, they need to be armed,” and “I knew I was doing something right by how angry my husband was.” (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) AUDREY VANN Blue Sun Palace USA, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Constance Tsang Tsang immediately proves herself a master of tight-space framing in her feature-length debut, ostensibly about a Queens massage parlor but really about so much more. Every bedroom, kitchen, lobby, stairwell, divey restaurant, rooftop, and mini-mall in Blue Sun Palace is immaculately staged. Fluorescent lights become angelic. Brief stutters of the hand after a bad phone call land like daggers. And intimacy, disgust, and grief fly off the screen in sequences that convey mountains of wordless emotion. Tsang’s trust in her cast pays off handsomely, as she lets conversations play out with zero cuts and one camera tucked into a tight room’s quarters. The results—the laughs, the bashfulness, and the stone-eyed stares—feel uniquely and powerfully American, as a Mandarin-fluent cast grapples with identity, homesickness, community, loss, isolation, violence, and shame in ways I haven’t seen in a SIFF film in some time. Bravo. CW: Sexual assault. (Shoreline Community College May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 24) SAM MACHKOVECH Boong India, 2024 (93 min), Dir. Lakshmipriya Devi Coming-of-age film Boong has all of the hallmarks of a first-time director overreaching. Plot lines either resolve abruptly or dangle. Characters don’t get enough room in either dialogue or action to become fully realized. And tone shifts dramatically, jumping from cheekiness to melodrama to heartbreak, often enough to distract viewers from fully connecting to its plot. But Boong also exists as a rare document of border clashes, ethnic conflicts, and family bonding inside the Indian state of Maripur—especially since they completed principal filming mere weeks before a civil war broke out that continues to this day. Thus, the film stands out for its unique and compelling perspective of Northeast India in a real-world zone that’s no longer easy to film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH The Botanist China, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jing Yi The premise of The Botanist seems simple: A 13-year-old boy is raised in a small community by his grandmother and falls in sweet, chaste puppy love with a neighbor girl. But, if the reviews are to be believed at least, the thing that makes this film special is the setting: the northern Chinese province of Xinjiang, just across the border from Kazakhstan. The Hollywood Reporter describes it as “an isolated community…where life goes on as if modern technology never existed,” and Screen Daily said it “runs dry on cohesive narrative.” But they all agree it’s very pretty. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ By Design USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Amanda Kramer Camille (Juliette Lewis) becomes enamored of a “stunner” of a chair she can’t afford, to the extent that she wishes she could become it. (“Oh, to be someone’s favorite thing.”) Her wish is granted—her spirit enters the chair, her body left inanimate. The people in her life continue on, monologuing around her limp form (Lewis is great at eyes-open draping), too self-absorbed to notice that she’s not entirely there. Meanwhile, an emotionally distant pianist named Olivier has fallen for the Camille chair; he can’t wait to get away from his vapid art community to spend time with her/it. By Design is surreal, aesthetically interesting (lots of MCM, but the strange lighting and proportions feel more uncanny than twee), and has the deadpan dialogue of a play. Themes include: literal objectification (obvi), tokenism, and maybe something about fetishization and consumerism? Absurdism as emotional truth? When a film is so avant-garde that you can tack almost any deeper interpretation onto it, you have to wonder if there actually is one. Or if you just need to sit with it longer. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES By the Stream South Korea, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Hong Sang-soo For last year’s SIFF roundup, I watched Hong Sang-soo’s In Our Day, in which next to nothing happened: A cat ran off, a poet drank an ill-advised beer, and three women murmured over a box of toiletries. This came as no surprise, because disguised within the mundanity of all Hong’s interpersonal films are lo-fi reflections on the cosmic mysteries of identity, vulnerability, and life itself. In By the Stream, the question is this: “What kind of person do you want to be?… How about saying it through improvised poetry?” One of the film’s quiet strengths lies in its nuanced depiction of artists—a weaver who creates in centimeters-per-hour, an actor who runs a bookshop by the sea. It’s a refreshing reprieve from that annoying film trope of artist-as-wacky-abstract-painter. Expect something akin to Aki Kaurismaki and Eric Rohmer’s storytelling here. People talk, people think, and then the film ends. It leaves you thinking, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21) LINDSAY COSTELLO Cat Town, USA USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Jonathan Napolitano Terry and Bruce Jenkins are an aging couple who have lived a big, adventurous life together, and in their golden years have converted their property into an elderly cat sanctuary called Cat’s Cradle—a place where older cats who are “out of options” can live out their lives and “be well loved again.” My HEART. Terry likes taking care of the more pragmatic tasks while Bruce creates obstacle courses and fiddles with technology like live-streaming. Birthday parties are thrown, catnip taste tests are conducted, and we get to know some of the retirees. The Jenkinses have a deep reverence for these cats, and the reality of their work is very bittersweet. It’s also very inspiring. We need more folks like these. Animals are the best of us, and people who are kind to animals deserve the world. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22, May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES ★ Chain Reactions USA, 2024 (101 min), Dir. Alexandre O. Philippe Swiss-American documentarian Alexandre O. Philippe has a longstanding preoccupation with American cinema history—he’s made films that look deeply at The Exorcist, Alien, and David Lynch’s love affair with The Wizard of Oz. It makes sense, then, that Phillipe would appreciate The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which (hot take incoming) is one of the best American films ever made. Chain Reactions is a straightforward celebration of the film: It launches directly into five interviews, which are interspersed with scream-heavy TCM clips and scenes from related flicks. Stephen King, Karyn Kusama, Takashi Miike, film critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and Patton Oswalt(?!) meditate on TCM’s avant-garde, experimental spirit. (Oswalt has some surprisingly poetic things to say about the film, including comparing its title to “chewing on flesh.”) If you’re interested in Tobe Hooper’s legacy and TCM’s connections to, say, Days of Heaven, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Bergman, or Tarkovsky, you’ll dig this. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) LINDSAY COSTELLO The Chef & the Daruma Canada, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Mads K. Baekkevold Director Mads K. Baekkevold covers a lot of ground in The Chef & the Daruma. On its surface, it’s about Hidekazu Tojo, one of the most famous sushi chefs in North America (he says he invented the California roll!). But while Tojo tells his story of how he went from cooking out of necessity for his large family in Japan to charging $330 a head for the top-tier Omakase experience at his Vancouver, Canada restaurant, we also learn more about the history of sushi, the region’s long-standing racism against Japanese-Canadians, how a Daruma works, how sake is made, and which contemporary Vancouver chefs, inspired by Tojo, are breaking new barriers in Vancouver’s food scene. I felt like I was watching different vignettes or episodes of a series, more than a well-rounded documentary. Still, it’s a thoughtful and gentle journey, filled with people who appreciate food. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) MEGAN SELING Cloud Japan, 2024 (124 min), Dir. Kiyoshi Kurosawa If ever an action-thriller could be described as “quiet,” Kurosawa’s Cloud fits the bill. (No, not Akira Kurosawa. This is Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the one who made Cure, Pulse, and other moody, often-overlooked J-horror gems.) Cloud’s murky nightmare unfolds in the world of digital dropshipping, which lands ruthless seller Ryôsuke in real-life danger when a band of buyers take issue with his get-rich-quick scheme. The slow, calculated action-thriller communicates in soft steps and hushed tones, broken only by the occasional gunshot beneath overcast—cloudy, even—skies. Cloud treads tricky terrain, though. I won’t spoil the story entirely, but it unravels in a way that strains plausibility. It’s clear the real villain isn’t Ryôsuke, but the suffocating grip of late-stage capitalism. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, May 25) LINDSAY COSTELLO ★ Coexistence, My Ass! USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Amber Fares Coexistence, My Ass! is a documentary about the activist and comedian Noam Schuster-Eliassi, a woman raised from birth to believe Israeli Jews and Palestinians could live in peace. This movie tells the truth that occupation and apartheid led to the genocide in Gaza, and it shows Schuster-Eliassi’s sincere political evolution as she comes to realize that the oppressed cannot coexist with their oppressor, that coexistence is only possible between equals. Certainly, she cares. But for all the talk about checkpoints, about fascism and violence, this is an Israeli story. Glimpsed mostly in shots of iPhones and television screens, the horrors in Gaza and the West Bank feel far away. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) VIVIAN McCALL Color Book USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. David Fortune Color Book, gorgeously rendered in black and white, tells the struggle of a newly widowed father trying to take his disabled son, Mason, to his baseball game. There is a lot going on here about love, loss, fatherhood, and community, but all I could focus on is how the true villain of this tale is the infrequent, unreliable Atlanta transportation system. As you watch Color Book, take note of how many times the dialogue is simply “Mason!” uttered in every shade of emotion known to man. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) NATHALIE GRAHAM Come Closer Israel, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Tom Nesher Grief is messy, and so is Eden, a young woman reeling from the sudden death of her younger brother. A sexy, hard-partying wild child and avatar of bisexual bad-influence stereotypes, she carves a swath of chaos through the lives of everyone around her. Her discovery of and connection with her brother’s secret girlfriend is an interesting exploration of how shared loss can build bonds in the most surprising places, but the narrative is hindered by a sense that Eden’s exaggeratedly unreliable character was written by PTA parents terrified of their children “partying.” (She’s also got shockingly long, sharp fingernails for someone in a lesbian relationship.) There are poignant moments, to be sure, but I struggled to find anything to care deeply about. (SIFF Film Center May 20, May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Come See Me in the Good Light USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Ryan White Winner of Sundance’s Festival Favorite Award, Come See Me in the Good Light is a documentary that follows Colorado’s Poet Laureate Andrea Gibson and their partner Megan Falley after Gibson is diagnosed with ovarian cancer and given two years to live. Variety called it “A luminous portrait of two poets navigating an incurable diagnosis,” and Salon said, “this film delivers hope and goosebumps in equal measure.” Bonus: It’s produced by Brandi Carlile and Tig Notaro. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING The Crowd Iran, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Sahand Kabiri Taking place in modern day Tehran, The Crowd tells the story of the planning of a going-away party for a beloved friend by his largely queer community. Over the course of the day, we are shown how this friend group is dealing with the recent death of one of their own, as well as how they navigate the suffocating oppressions of a patriarchal society that views homosexuality as punishable by death. As grim as this all might sound, The Crowd is ultimately a film about platonic love and perseverance, and the celebration of love and community. Shot over the course of 12 days in a playful visual style with collage elements mixed in (personal phone videos, photos, social-media screenshots), The Crowd is a sweet tribute to those leaving and those who have left. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, May 25) MICHAEL McKINNEY Dancing Queen in Hollywood Norway, 2025 (87 min), Dir. Aurora Gossé This movie was definitely not made for me. Yes, I love hip-hop and hip-hop dancing. But the way I enjoy these forms is not at all represented in any part of this film, which has a bunch of Norwegian kids going to LA to do their hip-hop dance thing. The filming is ugly, and the acting is barely above what we find in Kenan & Kel. In the words of Skepta: “That’s not [for] me.” (Shoreline Community College May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19) CHARLES MUDEDE The Dark Crystal with DJ NicFit USA, 1982 (93 min), Dirs.

Grace Glowicki SIFF describes Dead Lover as a “bizarre, performance art-coded, gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy about a lonely gravedigger who will do anything to build the perfect man.” If that intriguing word salad doesn’t pique your interest, consider this: SXSW’s film jury awarded Dead Lover with the NEON Auteur Award, describing it as “a tremendously original film.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, AMC Pacific Place May 24) MEGAN SELING Deaf Spain, 2025 (99 min), Dir.

(SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Diamonds Italy, 2024 (120 min), Dir. Ferzan Özpetek Whoa boy. Diamonds opens with director Ferzan Özpetek hosting a dinner for his 18 favorite actresses (“you are my diamonds!”), asking them to be in his film, which begins a few moments later. This metacinematic device is odd, but fine. That is, until we unnecessarily revisit the director’s table again midway through? The film inside the documentary tells the story of a women-led costume shop set in Rome in the ’70s. The set design and fashion are gorgeous, and everyone’s face is fun to look at, but the script is so incredibly predictable it veers into camp. Which I can get behind! By the time the Özpetek is inserted again, though, it’s clear he needs to center himself so you don’t forget who should be celebrated for celebrating these women. It’s such a brazen move I couldn’t do anything but laugh. Recommended if you’re like, day-buzzed on daiquiris and want a little spectacle (to laugh at, not with). (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24–25) EMILY NOKES Diciannove Italy, 2024 (109 min), Dir.

Unkovski It’s not easy being 15 in Northern Macedonia, especially for Ahmet, whose little brother, Naim, clams up in the wake of their mother’s death and whose dad obsesses over his fixing his brother’s muteness in all the wrong ways. Ahmet must abandon the usual hallmarks of teenagerdom (going to school, going to forest raves in the middle of the night) to instead schlep the family’s tobacco crop to market and tend to the family’s sheep. But, while diligently tending to the sheep, Ahmet, still a teenage boy, can’t help himself—he falls in love. With a girl trapped in an arranged marriage. Uh oh. The children of DJ Ahmet are trapped by the conservative traditions of their society and by the myopia of their own parents. Only through music—the thing Ahmet and Naim’s late mother cherished—and the slivers of technology they have access to, can the kids connect with each other, themselves, and begin to carve out the lives they want to start living.

Embeth Davidtz Film adaptations of successful books can be unpredictable, but Embeth Davidtz’s interpretation of Alexandra Fuller’s critically acclaimed 2001 memoir Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, about Fuller’s childhood in a white Zimbabwean family after the Rhodesian Bush War, appears to be a success. (Shoreline Community College May 17, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) MEGAN SELING Drowned Land USA, 2025 (86 min), Dir. Colleen Thurston (Choctaw Nation) It’s easy to think about environmental destruction mostly in big-picture terms. Drowned Land zooms in to tell the story of the Kiamichi River as not just an ecologically important body of water, but an ancestor, a being, a heart. It highlights the throughlines between cultural displacement, oppression of Indigenous people, and exploitation of natural resources. (It’s hard to think about the environment in the abstract when you’re reminded that in 2025, small, discarded communities are plagued by water too contaminated to safely wash dishes in, let alone drink.) The energy industry is a titanic foe, but the Choctaw Nation and other activists are steadfast in fighting back. As Thurston, the filmmaker, says, “This isn’t a redemption story, but it is a story about reclamation.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Drowning Dry Lithuania, 2024 (88 min), Dir. Laurynas Bareiša As with Moon (see my review, also in this guide), Drowning Dry begins with a mixed martial arts competition. But unlike Moon, the movie’s key character, Lukas, wins. And, after celebrating this win, he and his family (wife, son, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, niece) go to a country house by a lake to relax. Slowly, cracks begin to appear. But these are very human cracks. In fact, the film is really a work of philosophical anthropology that’s expressed with two narrative modes: one in which little happens slowly, and one in which a lot happens slowly. When the latter occurs, we are exposed to the terrifying frailty of the human condition. To intensify the experience of the modes, the film employs only diegetic music and naturalistic lighting and shot positions. The result is, for me, the best movie I have so far seen in SIFF. (SIFF Film Center May 17, Shoreline Community College May 22) CHARLES MUDEDE Evergreens USA, 2025 (120 min), Dir. Jared Briley Spokane-based director Jared Briley didn’t take shortcuts when crafting his directorial debut, Evergreens.

Nabil Ayouch Touda (Nisrin Erradi) is a young woman who lives in a remote part of Morocco and dreams of making it big as a traditional dancer and singer. She has a son who is treated like shit at school because of his disability. And her jobs often expose her to sleazy men and sexual violence. One day, she decides to move to Casablanca to make her dreams come true. The movie, though visually gorgeous and filled richly with music and dancing, ultimately feels unreal. I’m not sure if this was the intention of the director, Nabil Ayouch, but Touda’s journey unfolds and even floats from scene to scene like a fairytale. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) CHARLES MUDEDE Familiar Touch USA, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Sarah Friedland It is no wonder Familiar Touch won “Best Debut Film” at Venice Film Festival and has several other awards under its belt already. Sarah Friedland takes us through a poignant character study of Ruth Goldman (Broadway legend Kathleen Chalfant), who has lived a full life, only to have it scrambled by severe dementia in the end. For anyone who has worried about the effects of dementia on our loved ones, or stayed up late wondering where our parents will spend the rest of their lives, this film hits you straight in the chest. Kathleen Chalfant’s performance is a Master Class through the slow-moving, gorgeous cinematography that is Familiar Touch. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, Shoreline Community College May 25) RACHEL STEVENS Flamingos: Life After the Meteorite Mexico, 2024 (83 min), Dir. Lorenzo Hagerman Flamingos are strange. With their absurdly spindly legs, weird beaks, and cartoon coloring, they look like a bubblegum sculpture whose artist ran out of gum and had to stretch what they had to the point of absurdity. This documentary was clearly made by people who love flamingos. It’s full of gorgeous footage of the birds flying, wading, nesting, incubating, and mating. (Flamingo sex is hilarious, by the way, especially when set to bizarrely sexy music.) The storytelling format is a bit wobbly, and some scenes drag on too long to let the filmmakers use all the music they paid for, but there are plenty of worse things to sit through than an excess of beautiful nature shots. (Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Fly Me to the Moon Hong Kong, 2023 (112 min), Dir. Sasha Chuk Fly Me To The Moon tells the story of a family from mainland China who have just migrated to Hong Kong to make a better life for themselves. Beginning in the late ’90s, the film spans two decades, focusing on the coming of age of two young daughters as they come face to face with the growing pains of the migrant experience. While trying to escape social ostracization from schoolmates through assimilation, the daughers find that things are not any easier at home as their father falls into a pattern of drug use and petty theft and is in and out of jail over the course of their adolescence. The film is a slow meditation on growing up and how we forgive, forget, and forge new paths in light of broken dreams.

Darren Thornton In this Irish remake of the 2008 Italian film Mid-August Lunch, gay author Edward’s (James McArdle) queer coming-of-age novel unexpectedly becomes a viral BookTok hit. Forced to choose between embarking on a book tour in the US or staying home to take care of his ailing mother (Fionnula Flanagan), who has suffered a stroke and can only communicate via iPad text-to-speech, he sabotages himself by avoiding going after what he wants…until his self-serving gay friends unceremoniously dump their mothers at his home so they can abscond to Maspalomas Pride. Edward, Alma, and their three new houseguests form an unlikely found family, resulting in an impromptu road trip to visit a medium. The film doesn’t hit every beat and meanders into predictable territory at times, but it’s got plenty of charm, and Flanagan speaks volumes with her arresting facial expressions without uttering a single word aloud. (Opening Night: Paramount Theater May 15) JULIANNE BELL Free Leonard Peltier USA, 2025 (110 min), Dirs. Jesse Short Bull (Oglala Sioux) and David France In January, directors David France and Jesse Short Bull probably thought they were done with their documentary, Free Leonard Peltier. The Sundance date was set. Then one week before the film’s premiere, President Biden announced he was commuting Peltier’s contentious life sentence. But critics say timing isn’t the only thing that sets this film apart from previous projects—Variety praised it for having a “wider focus” than 1992’s Incident at Oglala, “placing the incidents detailed here in the context of America’s long and shameful history of exploiting, betraying, and even murdering Native people.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 16–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Freeing Juanita USA, 2024 (74 min), Dir. Sebastián Lasaosa Rogers In 2014, as immigration to the US from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador skyrocketed, Mexico committed to detaining migrants as they passed through Mexico, rather than allowing them to cross the US border. That same year, Juanita, an indigenous Guatemalan who speaks Maya, not Spanish, was detained by the Mexican government, and confessed to a crime in a language she didn’t speak. Freeing Juanita tells the story of her aunt and uncle, who journeyed a thousand miles from their home in the Guatemalan mountains to advocate for her release. As a human-scale story, it would be striking at any time, but this year? Their vulnerability and determination strike especially deeply.

It opens on a floating raft in an alternative pre-millennium universe. A young sex worker (Annapurna Sriram) is on a raft, telling a psychic (Big Freedia) about how she’s losing her teeth. She’s cursed, the psychic says. And for the low, low price of $1,000 and an innocent lamb, she can break it. So she takes off into this fictional world, called Trashtown, where the cops are Tom of Finland doms and the fancy hotel is called Fancy Hotel. The journey to finding the cash to break the curse is campy, bloody, and full of other bodily fluids. The story will break your heart a little, but it’s worth it.

(SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18) MEGAN SELING The Gloria of your Imagination USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. Jennifer Reeves The Gloria of your Imagination is either a tough or a really easy sell, depending on who you are. The “dual-projection performance” shares footage from recorded therapy sessions with a 30-year-old single mother in 1964. Gloria, perfectly coiffed, chain-smoking, and toting a wicker pocketbook, shares her anxieties about men, sex, and motherhood with three spectacled dudes, who emit varying levels of douchiness: Gestalt founder Fritz Perls (who calls Gloria “phony” in session), humanistic psychology founder Carl Rogers, and rational emotive behavior therapy founder Albert Ellis. The audience learns that Gloria consented to having the sessions filmed, but not to their being publicly exhibited—which they were, widely. Gloria sues for damages. This reveal causes me to question, then, my complicity in watching the sessions now. After all, The Gloria of your Imagination encourages conclusions that most of us have come to before—the ’60s were an exceptionally sexist time, and modern psychotherapy has its flaws. (SIFF Film Center May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) LINDSAY COSTELLO Good Boy USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Ben Leonberg It sounds like a gimmick—a supernatural thriller starring a dog—but Good Boy has received some impressive accolades since debuting at SXSW earlier this year. Horror movie homebase Dread Central called it “surprisingly poignant,” the Hollywood Reporter praised the film’s emotional power, and Indiewire gave it an A-, calling Indy the dog’s performance “affecting.” (Spoiler: DoestheDogDie.com promises that Indy survives.) (AMC Pacific Place May 24, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25) MEGAN SELING Hanami Switzerland, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Denise Fernandes “I think that inside of us, the broken pieces are put together with gold,” says Nana, the central character, in a voiceover in the opening scene. She’s referring to Kintsugi, the Japanese practice of repairing broken pottery with gold powder, highlighting the cracks as a part of its history. But Nana’s speaking from a whole different volcanic island in a whole different ocean: Fogo, Cape Verde. Part coming-of-age story, part surreal fever dream, Hanami follows Nana’s young life, grappling with being left in Cape Verde by her mother, the community that cares for her, and having to decide what “home” actually means to her.

Scandar Copti Oscar-nominated Palestinian director Scandar Copti’s new film gives us an enlightening look into the oppressive everyday lives of a middle-class Arab family living in Israel. Told through a series of vignettes focusing on different members of the family, the film explores how the countries’ divisions affect almost all aspects of their daily lives, from navigating relationships and dating, to dealing with cultural conventions and expectations. How does one find personal agency when all of the external forces around you feel so constricting? (SIFF Film Center May 21, AMC Pacific Place May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY Happyend Japan, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Neo Sora In Japan’s near future, the authoritarians are in control. They use an impending, once-in-a-century earthquake to justify police crackdowns on immigrants and political dissidents. For Yuta and Kou, two best friends set to soon graduate high school, it’s just daily life. It isn’t until the principal responds to their daring prank and installs a new AI-powered security system called Panopty (get it?) that the country’s crumbling politics become real. Kou sees them one way, Yuta another, threatening their friendship. Happyend is about how people react when the unthinkable happens. Do they decide? Do circumstances of race and class decide for them? Is the answer somewhere in the middle? A film for our political age, Happyend is a must see. (AMC Pacific Place May 22–23) VIVIAN McCALL ★ Heightened Scrutiny USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Sam Feder Last year, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio became the first trans attorney to argue before the US Supreme Court in the first big trans-rights case of this second shitty Trump era. The question at the center of US v. Skrmetti: Was the state of Tennessee violating the constitutional rights of transgender kids when it banned puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria, while allowing doctors to offer the exact same treatments to intersex and cis kids for different medical reasons? Heightened Scrutiny makes the high-as-fuck stakes clear through shots of community meetings and serious interviews with serious people sitting in bare rooms, pizzicato strings plucking away seriously in the background. But it’s also a sweet profile of Strangio, who says arguing a case before the court is not his dream, but a nightmare for a nice normal guy with an albatross of responsibility around his neck. It’s not the most intimate profile—it couldn’t be, Strangio is a high-profile, media-trained lawyer—but Feder’s made a political document worth seeing. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Home Sweet Home Denmark, 2025 (112 min), Dir. Frelle Petersen Do you want to see the kind of work immigrants in the USA do? Well, watch this movie, which concerns a Danish woman, Sofie (Jette Søndergaard), who, though white, is a home care worker. This film is raw. It doesn’t hide a damn thing. You see it all: caregivers (some of whom are Black) cleaning penises, handingly bodies that are about to fall apart, putting dentures into mouths, and so on. The film is slow (even monotonous) but boy does it tell like it is. It’s hard being an old person in a capitalist (USA, UK, Denmark) society. You are lonely, waiting for death, and completely dependent on caregivers who are often poorly paid immigrants. (AMC Pacific Place May 20–21) CHARLES MUDEDE How to Build a Library Kenya, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Maia Lekow and Christopher King Variety describes How to Build a Library, a documentary by Maia Lekow and Christopher King, as “straightforward, methodical.” It features two Kenyan woman restructuring, over several years (their project began in 2018), a colonial-era library in the heart of their country’s capital, Nairobi. This work of transformation turns out to have numerous difficulties, one of which, not surprisingly, is the stubbornness of the post-colonial government. Anyone who has lived in an English-speaking African country knows the British did a number on the locals. Undoing what Fela Kuti famously called “colonial mentality” is like moving a mountain. (May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) CHARLES MUDEDE I Am Nevenka Spain, 2024 (112 min), Dir. Icíar Bollaín I Am Nevenka is a biographical drama about Nevenka Fernandez, the plaintiff in Spain’s first case in which a politician was convicted of sexual harassment. Variety called the case “a landmark judicial sentence 15 years before the #MeToo movement.” As a big fan of made-for-TV Lifetime movies, I’m especially intrigued by what movies review magazine Little White Lies had to say about it: “It’s a trashy, tabloid-y film, but it’s a fine one, and a story that still needs to be told again, and again, and again.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 23) MEGAN SELING Idyllic Netherlands, 2025 (99 min), Dir. Aaron Rookus This dense Dutch film is made with great care and intelligence. At its center is an opera singer, Annika (Eelco Smits), who is facing the nothingness of a death that will soon consume her glamorous life. The heaviness of her situation, which is always in her eyes and her gestures, streams to all the other parts of the film’s sprawling story, which easily could have been a TV series. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Into the Wonderwoods France, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Alexis Ducord and Vincent Paronnaud You know when you have a dream where there is one big mission, but seemingly hundreds of side-plots with too many characters to count? And then you wake up and you’re like, “That was AWESOME.” Into the Wonderwoods is that fever-dream. This animated film has been translated from French to English, but you know the French are freaky AF, and it shows in this adventure of a 10-year-old boy, Angelo, who gets separated from his family and travels through a forest filled with ogres, robots, magic landscapes, and more. His imagination helps him brave the elements and even join a resistance. Into the Wonderwoods is for children ages 8 and above, and the young at heart. (Though I let my 5-year-old watch it with me and she hasn’t stopped talking about it since.) (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, Shoreline Community College May 18) RACHEL STEVENS Invention USA, 2024 (72 min), Dir. Courtney Stephens I love a movie that refuses to have a genre. Invention blends fiction and autobiographical documentary to something warm and a little bit magical. In this “meta fiction,” co-writers Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez create a fictional version of the immediate aftermath of Hernandez’s father’s death, but intersplices real found VHS footage of her own father. It’s messy, but so is grief. (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Jean Cocteau USA, 2024 (94 min), Dir. Lisa Immordino Vreeland Jean Cocteau is a perfect example of a documentary with a captivating subject, but unfortunately, bland filmmaking. While I appreciated that the film let the iconic Renaissance man speak for himself—weaving together interviews, journals, and clips from his films—narrative gaps were filled by walls of text that I found clunky and uninspiring. However, this was also the first biography of Cocteau I’ve seen that gives adequate attention to his identity as a gay man and love affairs with collaborators like Jean Marais, Raymond Radiguet, and Édouard Dermit. The film also touched on his controversial friendship with Nazi sculptor Arno Breker, but lacked a stance, quoting Cocteau’s belief that friendship is more important than politics. As the credits rolled, I wasn’t particularly surprised to see that the film was funded in part by fashion giant Chanel, whose founder, Coco (a known Nazi sympathizer), designed costumes for many of Cocteau’s stage productions. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) AUDREY VANN John Cranko Germany, 2024 (135 min), Dir. Joachim Lang Without a doubt, John Cranko is no Amadeus. Nevertheless, it’s not half bad. The reason for this biopic’s success is found in the actor who plays John Cranko: Sam Riley. Most of us know Riley from another biopic, Control (he plays somber Ian Curtis). In this title role, he is the legendary and complicated South African choreographer who ran Stuttgart Ballet in the 1960s, John Cranko. Though highly entertaining, John Cranko offers nothing new. It has, like most biopics of its kind, scenes of the genius in a mess, the genius struggling with the establishment and lazy dancers, and, of course, the genius smoking like a chimney as he gives inspiring speeches that show why he is a genius. Rock me, Cranko. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22–23; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Joqtau Kazakhstan, 2024 (71 min), Dir. Aruan Anartay After several years abroad, young scientist Darkhan returns home to Kazakhstan with his girlfriend Elena, and they join his enigmatic grandfather on a trip to the plains of their ancestral homeland. In the opening credits, we learn the title refers to a traditional Kazakh mourning song, and that sense of quiet grief lingers throughout this sparse, poetic journey. Joqtau explores family legacy and cultural erosion, and the film style shifts fluidly between the intimacy of a family dinner and the observational feel of a documentary. As they move through the countryside, Elena remains a quiet observer as Darkhan slowly reconnects with his roots. Joqtau is low on plot but high on vibe, and it leaves its somber atmosphere behind after it ends. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20, SIFF Film Center May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) BREE McKENNA Ka Whawhai Tonu: Struggle Without End New Zealand, 2024 (115 min), Dir. Michael Jonathan Rare is the coming-of-age wartime film that successfully combines wildly disparate tones, like sweetness and brutality, or humor and tension. Ka Whawhai Tonu’s unflinching look at the 19th-century New Zealand Wars is an astonishing example of consistent tone and spirit in a film about colonialist travesties. The film opens on a Māori tribe capturing a half-Māori, half-European teen boy ahead of a siege by European forces and mistreating him. A teen girl in the encampment, herself facing similar adult maltreatment, finds ways to help the boy, thus sealing their friendship—while also stoking tensions among leaders. There are no winners in this conflict as viewed through younger eyes (“adults made me something I’m not, for an adult’s war”), but through this film’s genuine anguish comes a remarkable document of the human spirit at its best—and its worst. Temuera Morrison has a hell of a performance as equal parts diplomat, commander, and elder, while Paku Fernandez’s teenage vulnerability and tenacity put the beautifully shot film over the top.

Anas Saeed, Rawia Alhag, Brahim Snoopy, Timeea Mohamed Ahmed, and Phil Cox In Khartoum, five directors collaborate with five refugees from different backgrounds to reenact their life-changing experiences in the Sudanese Civil War. Sometimes their stories are supported by props and CGI renderings of the places they’re describing; other times, they’re acted out in front of blank green screens with a boom mic dipping into frame. Either way, the subjects take turns acting in each other’s stories, positioned and fed lines as they go, often embodying people who had drastically different experiences than their own. It’s a collective effort with something to say about community, justice, and storytelling. Khartoum is special. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY The Kingdom France, 2024 (108 min), Dir. Julien Colonna Sadly, this is not the 2007 action thriller starring Jamie Foxx! Instead, it sounds much more intense. SIFF’s provided description reads: “When an underground war breaks out between nationalist groups and crime families, a Corsican mobster and his daughter must go on the run, bringing them closer together and drawing her into his world.” Don’t let that scare you away! Julien Colonna’s 2024 Kingdom currently has a 100 percent critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 14 reviews from outlets including IndieWire and Variety, while Foxx’s Kingdom is sitting not-so-pretty at 51 percent. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, May 23) MEGAN SELING ★ Know Her Name Canada, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Zainab Muse Women were powerful in early Hollywood, and what happened will not surprise you. Money (and men) changed everything. In the freewheeling years before California lured the film industry west with tax breaks, it didn’t matter as much who was on set writing the scripts, running the cameras, or even cutting the checks (Alice Guy-Blaché made 1,000 films and ran her Solex studios in New Jersey—a “fine example of what a woman can do if given a square chance in life,” according to the Motion Picture News in 1911.) Then men took the whole thing over and still haven’t let go, more than 100 years later, enough time for us to nearly forget about pioneers like Guy-Blaché. Countless other women won’t even get that chance—75 to 90 percent of American films shot before 1929 are lost to time. Exactly why women were written out of history is a complex question, but it’s clear those opportunities never came back. Know Her Name does what only a good documentary can, unspooling the historical record so slowly and thoughtfully that it’s hard to pinpoint when a rage started smoldering in my gut. By the time the credits rolled, I didn’t just feel angry, I felt cheated out of great films that never were.

Snyder Just six minutes into The Librarians, a librarian starts to cry. That’s how bad it is out there for those working in states such as Texas and Florida, where conservatives are calling for the removal of hundreds of books. While book banning is nothing new, it has grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, largely due to the right-wing organization Moms for Liberty. But the librarians aren’t having it. They’re fighting back. They’re defending their duty to ensure their school and public libraries are inclusive, welcoming spaces, and it’s costing them their jobs, their relationships, and, in some cases, their safety. But lest people think this all comes down to ethics and morality, The Librarians does a great job digging a little deeper to show that all the fighting, screaming, and literal book burning ultimately come down to one thing: money. You’ll leave the theater wanting to simultaneously hug a librarian and burn the world to the ground. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) MEGAN SELING Little Red Sweet Hong Kong, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Vincent Chow A young Chinese woman gives up her dreams of being a flight attendant and returns home to help run the family’s dessert shop after her mother suffers a stroke. Despite her sacrifices, her dad won’t let her in the kitchen to help make their famous, secret recipe red bean soup. Drama! One reviewer called it “undercooked.” One review we translated from Chinese reads: “It seems to be cleaned with bleach. It’s a clean movie, a movie without life.” (AMC Pacific Place May 21, Shoreline Community College May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM LUZ Hong Kong, 2025 (102 min), Dir. Flora Lau Amid neon-streaked Chongqing’s nightlife scene, karaoke bar employee Wei (Guo Xiaodong) attempts to contact his estranged daughter Fa (Deng Enxi). Meanwhile, Hong Kong gallerist Ren (Sandrine Pinna) reconnects with her stepmother Sabine (the iconic Isabelle Huppert), who devotes her time to the Parisian art world and was recently diagnosed with a fatal aneurysm. One day, Wei and Ren cross paths in an open-world VR game called Luz, in which players navigate a dreamlike cyberpunk setting on a quest to find a shimmering, ethereal deer. The film has mesmerizing visuals and raises interesting questions about art, interpersonal connection in the digital age, and the blurred lines between artifice and reality, but unfortunately lacks the emotional substance to back it up. Nevertheless, Huppert delivers a standout performance as always, and it’s a joy to watch her vaping and dancing in the face of death. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20, AMC Pacific Place May 22) JULIANNE BELL ★ Manas Brazil, Portugal, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Marianna Brennand Based on director Marianna Brennand’s decade of research into the sexual abuse of children and teenagers in the Amazon rainforest, Manas is as devastating as it sounds. The drama follows 13-year-old Tielle through a world where abuse is the norm of girlhood. The film moves slowly, lingering over every facial expression and piece of the story, featuring beautifully designed shots amidst the ugliness of its subject matter. At one particularly gutting moment, Tielle’s mother tells her, “there’s no use trying to change some things.” And yet, Tielle attempts to alter the generational script, as does this film, by creating this unflinching portrait of such a difficult topic. (SIFF Film Center May 16, May 18) ROBIN EDWARDS Meeting with Pol Pot France, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Rithy Panh If longtime Cambodian director Rithy Panh is new to you, and you’re horny for accolades, know this: His 1994 film Rice People was the first Cambodian film to be submitted for an Oscar and several of his films have shown at Cannes, including 2003’s S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine, which won Prix François Chalais, and his 2013 documentary The Missing Picture which took home the Un Certain Regard title. So chances are, Meeting with Pol Pot, which is partly based on the book When the War Was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution by Elizabeth Becker, will not be bad. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 20) MEGAN SELING ★ Monarch City USA, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Titus Richard Monarch City is of great importance to the history of this region’s cinema, because it is Paul Eenhoorn’s last film. For those not familiar with this actor, who came from Australia and wound up in Seattle, he spent the last part of his life starring or appearing in a number of local indie films before dying in his sleep in Tacoma in 2022. His moment, however, arrived in 2014 with the film Land Ho!, which made a splash at Sundance, and concerned two elderly men enjoying all that Iceland has to offer. Monarch City is set in a town outside of Seattle. Eenhoorn plays Sam, a broken man in a broken town (alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, guns, dead dives, beat-up pickup trucks). Sam recites poetry about arriving at other shores. He smokes and drinks and carries a gun. And he ends the film with a meditation on death. Goodnight, Eenhoorn. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Mongrels Canada, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Jerome Yoo If you consider yourself a dog lover, best beware that a bunch of them brutally bite the dust in this visually poetic, though ultimately scattered, directorial debut. Mongrels is told in three parts and centered on a Korean father tasked with killing dogs in the woods, his troubled son, and his imaginative daughter still trying to remain connected to her absent mother. The film follows the family as they begin to make a new life in small-town Canada. It thrives when it lets us sit with the more ephemeral sense of loss, though it eventually becomes overly literal. As one part fades into the next, hitting plenty of familiar coming-of-age beats, the portrait it tries to paint never quite comes into focus as beautifully as the visuals do. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Monk in Pieces USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Billy Shebar and David Roberts The answer to everything is just to keep making art long enough that people finally get it and pronounce you a genius. At least that’s what I learned from this loving and insightful portrayal of avant-garde musician, director, and lifelong performance artist Meredith Monk. The documentary presents Monk’s work and life in a greatest-hits mosaic, featuring interviews with David Byrne, Philip Glass, and Björk. I especially loved seeing the evolution of sexist early reviewers calling her work narcissistic, self-centered (isn’t most art self-centered?), and, my favorite, “it made my cats bite each other,” to critics finally recognizing her impact and singular vision. All the while, she continued making delightfully freaky operas that feel plucked from another dimension in the same NYC warehouse she’s lived in since the ’70s with her pet turtle, Neutron. I dream of a Seattle where artists can make our work well into our 80s, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Moon Austria, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Kurdwin Ayub After losing a big fight, a famous and top-rated Austrian martial arts fighter, Sarah (Florentina Holzinger), retires. But what is she to do with the rest of her life? She is still young and has a lot of time on her hands. Out of the blue, a rich Jordanian offers her a lot of money to train his sisters, who, he claims, have taken an interest in martial arts. It’s big in Jordan. Sara accepts the offer, flies to Amman, gets set up in a fancy hotel, and soon after is introduced to the sisters, who live in a gaudy mansion on the outskirts of the city. The first training session, however, goes badly. So does the next one. Eventually, it becomes obvious that something is profoundly wrong with the sisters, their brother, his bodyguards, and the mansion. The film becomes a thriller. What is really going on here? Is Sarah’s life in danger? Moon is great until the last 10 minutes. (SIFF Film Center May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 23) CHARLES MUDEDE The Nature of Invisible Things Brazil, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Rafaela Camelo There’s something so compelling about the way children make friends: trading secrets, building mythology, finding your own language of play. In The Nature of Invisible Things, that friendship unfolds between two young girls in a hospital—one spending her summer vacation with her mother, a nurse, and the other waiting for her granny to get well. The film passes back and forth between the stark realities of the hospital, and the surreal imaginations of children trying to make sense of the world around them. It has moments of being genuinely unsettling (it is a hospital after all) but most of the film is a frank portrait of two girls, their two moms, and how they all seek out joy.

Lanfia Wal When was the last time you saw a lo-fi, neon action movie with a virtually all-Black cast, knock-off Michael Jackson, and a scene pulled straight out of Street Fighter? If your answer is “never” (like mine was), New Jack Fury is your chance. It starts with someone getting hit with a dirty 18-inch dildo, and it ends with a dance off, swords, and betrayal. Watch this one, if only because you won’t see anything else like this self-aware, chaotic dreamscape for a long time.

Bogdan Mureşanu On one hand, The New Year That Never Came is an award-winning and critically acclaimed film about six lives intersecting on the streets of Romania on December 20, 1989. Their stories unfold throughout the day while Nicolae Ceaușescu’s communist regime famously falls. But with a movie poster that highlights the ensemble cast, I can’t help but imagine it as some kind of Love, Actually or New Year’s Eve rom-com starring Zac Efron and Katherine Heigl… but with a presidential execution at the end. I’d watch the fuck out of that. (AMC Pacific Place May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING Odd Fish Iceland, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Snævar Sölvason Odd Fish is Iceland’s first film about a trans woman. This is the story: Two old friends who run a cozy little restaurant in a lovely little town that attracts tourists from Norway and other such parts are about to finally get filthy rich because a corporation wants to bring visitors all year round. The restaurant can expand; the town can grow. What more do you want? After the good economic news, one of the restaurant’s owners and cook, Björn, comes out as a woman. This coming out was instigated by her father’s death. The other owner, Hjalti, is smashed by this transition. He is already homophobic. How can he work with a trans woman? Though this part of the film is important, it has no surprises. And what really amazes you are the wide shots that capture the cold and treeless beauty of this island from another planet.

Sook-Yin Lee I was pleasantly surprised by Paying for It, Sook-Yin Lee’s adaptation of her ex-boyfriend Chester Brown’s autobiographical graphic novel of the same name. The story is based on the couple’s real-life breakup, in which Lee searches for new emotional connections with other men while Brown altogether ditches the idea of romantic love and visits sex workers whenever he’s feeling horny. Paying for It could’ve easily devolved into a messy and overwrought hot take on the ethics of monogamy and the morality of sex work. Instead, it’s a realistic and thoughtfully paced portrayal of two people maneuvering new territory, both as individuals and as a bonded pair, in order to find what version of love and companionship makes them happiest. What’s right for them may not be right for everyone (or anyone) else, and that’s okay. It’s actually very sweet. Bonus: Director Sook-Yin Lee is scheduled to attend the screenings. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING ★ Raptures Sweden, 2025 (108 min), Dir. Jon Blåhed Shot beautifully in a bucolic Scandinavia, Raptures tells the story of Rakel, a traditional and devout Christian living in a small Swedish village in the 1930s. As her increasingly delusional alcoholic husband, Teodor, breaks away from the church to start preaching his own messages that come directly from God (red! flag!), she must navigate her own conflicting feelings and beliefs as the anxieties of a looming world war simmer in the background. Will a large crystal arc show up to save the believers? Is a Teodor sex party in the sectarian cult house really part of God’s plan? It’s Ingmar Bergman meets Midsommar, and it’s the first feature film ever with a main dialogue in the minority language Meänkieli. It’s also brilliantly acted and totally worth watching. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Ready or Not Ireland, 2025 (83 min), Dir. Claire Frances Byrne Dublin, 1998: A summer of firsts for Katie (Ruby Conway Dunne) and her friends. First kisses. First drinks. Realizing for the first time that the world, and boys, mean to eat up teenage girls. Conway Dunne and Molly Byrne, who plays her best friend Danni in the film, teeter believably on the edge of adolescence. When nobody is watching, they’re playful kids. At school and parties, they’re kids trying their best at being adults. Even though I didn’t care for all the voiceover (of the “record scratch, isn’t my life soo crazy” variety) or that the script seemed to have left what should have been subtext in big bold letters, I liked this movie because those kids acted like real kids—swearing, crying, and handling everything very poorly. I just had to know if they’d be okay in the end. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22) VIVIAN McCALL Remaining Native USA, 2025 (87 min), Paige Bethmann Teenage cross-country phenom Ku Stevens aspires to leave his small Nevada town for college, but along the way, he wrestles with shadows of his Indigenous family’s American experience. At its best, this documentary offers an unblinking look at physical and cultural violence perpetrated by white Americans, all while humanely framing Native Americans’ continuing efforts to grieve, process, and persevere. The film’s strongest moments—particularly Stevens retracing his great-grandfather’s 50-mile running escape from a brutal boarding school—are hampered by poor pacing and editing decisions. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Riefenstahl Germany, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Andres Veiel For decades, people have debated Leni Riefenstahl’s films. Was her Hitler-sanctioned documentary, The Triumph of the Will, historic filmmaking or Nazi propaganda? While my inclination is to roll my eyes and say, “Bitch was a Nazi, let her rot,” I’m intrigued by Andres Veiel’s documentary, Riefenstahl, which The Hollywood Reporter says highlights the “‘seductive nature of fascism’ both the 1930 variety and the updated versions of today.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING The Safe House Switzerland, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Lionel Baier Revolution! 1960s Paris! A Tenenbaum-esque multigenerational residence! So much to love about this film, right? Mais non, The Safe House falls flat. Taking place during the social uprisings in May 1968, France, the film focuses on the perspectives of a halfway eccentric middle-class family existing mostly domestically while violence ensues out in the streets. The film makes little (if any) real commentary on the politics of the time, and lacks any real emotion via family dynamics. And while I personally believe that a film can survive—if not thrive—on style over substance with the proper imagination, The Safe House is tepid at best in its art direction as well. The “quirky” visual and editing tricks are tired, and the voiceover muddies rather than helps the narrative along. While there are wisps of Tati and Godard in the DNA of this film, you are better off just visiting those directors’ films. Or Bertolucci’s The Dreamers, which is also about the May ’68 uprisings, but good. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Sally USA, 2025 (103 min), Dir. Cristina Costantini It wasn’t until seeing Sally that I realized flying into space may be one of the less impressive accomplishments on astronaut Sally Ride’s resume. Because you know what’s harder than getting four degrees at Stanford, pushing through years of grueling physical training, and getting taken seriously as one of fewer than a dozen women at NASA in the 1980s? Bearing the brunt of the world’s misogyny while hiding the fact that you’re gay, even from your closest friends and family for fear of how it could impact your hard-earned career. In Sally, Ride’s long-time partner Tam O’Shaughnessy introduces us to the side of Ride that Ride was too scared to share while she was alive. We get to meet the complex, vulnerable woman behind the confident public figure. It’s as inspiring as you’d expect a documentary about a trailblazer to be, but with a hefty, bittersweet, even heartbreaking, dose of reality. (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22) MEGAN SELING Salsa Lives Colombia, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Juan Carvajal Did you know salsa, the dance, not the sauce, was born in New York City? Existing rhythms in Cuba, Cuba Son and Afro-Cuban rumba merged with American jazz to create the hip-swiveling dance. Since its Big Apple inception, salsa has spread across the world. But, nowhere is it more popular these days than in Cali, Colombia. Salsa Lives traces that spicy history in what’s supposed to be a vibrant—NOT MILD—experience. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) NATHALIE GRAHAM ★ Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass United Kingdom, 2024 (76 min), Dir. Stephen Quay and Timothy Quay To the outside world, in his home country, Józef’s father is dead. But inside the walls of this dingy, remote sanatorium, he is alive. Sort of. His death simply hasn’t arrived yet. Time is different here. It lags. It stretches, skitters, and loops. But that’s grief for you, rendered here in beautiful and surreal stop motion. I liked this movie enough to buy the short story collection it was based on—Polish Jewish writer Bruno Schulz’s meditation on his father’s death (published five years before the Gestapo shot the writer dead). But I’m patient. I enjoy wondering what’s going on. If you can’t stand ambiguity, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass may have you checking the sign of your watch. Stephen and Timothy Quay fans will know the film is a sequel of sorts—their most well-known work is 1986’s Street of Crocodiles, another Schulz adaptation. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18, May 23) VIVIAN McCALL Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers USA, 1972 (82 min), Dir. Robert J. Kaplan If you are a fan of any of the following, then Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers is a must-watch for you: the early films of John Waters, vanilla ice-cream cones, ostrich-feather boas, and Buster Keaton-style physical comedy. Robert J. Kaplan (whose only other directorial credit is the pornographic Jaws spoof Gums) directs this long-lost camp masterpiece starring Warhol superstar and transgender icon Holly Woodlawn as she flees her boring Kansas upbringing to make it as an actress in New York City. Along the way, she meets an eccentric cast of characters, including a sailor-mouthed nun, misandrist twin sisters, and a revered lounge singer named Mary Poppins (played by fellow Warhol superstar Tally Brown). I am so pleased to see this film receive a snazzy restoration and a proper theater screening—I predict a Criterion release is on the horizon. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24) AUDREY VANN Seeds USA, 2025 (122 min), Dir. Brittany Shyne Director and cinematographer Shyne spent nine years watching and listening to Black farmers in rural Georgia, and the end result is impossibly beautiful. Like any documentary, you see these families through her eyes, but from the families, you rarely feel the self-consciousness that comes from being watched—which just reveals how much time and patience Shyne put into this project. Shot all in black and white, the film is quiet, allowing for the long, languid pauses of rural life. But it only takes a few scenes to fully pull you in. This film won Sundance’s best documentary for a reason. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ She’s the He USA, 2025 (81 min), Dir. Siobhan McCarthy This queer teen comedy starts, like many teen comedies do, with a harebrained deception scheme. Playing on conservative hysteria surrounding all-gender bathrooms, She’s the He finds best friends Ethan (Misha Osherovich) and Alex (Nico Carney) pretending to be trans to enter the girls’ locker room at school, leading Ethan to the realization that she actually is trans. The quick-witted film with a majority trans cast checks off the high school movie tropes, including makeover scenes, a blooper reel, and raunchy jokes, while creating tender moments where Osherovich’s full-hearted performance makes the coming-out story shine. It’s a lot of fun! And the costumes were so cool, I went back to the credits to track down who the designer was (Leah Morrison) and creepily requested her private Instagram. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 20) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Shepherds Canada (Québec), 2025 (113 min), Dir. Sophie Deraspe In this funny, existential drama, a burned-out Québécois marketing executive sends a fuck-off email to his bosses, gives away his possessions, maxes out his credit cards, and flees to the south of France. Dreaming of a simpler life, he wants to become a shepherd. He clumsily introduces himself to local farmers who immediately clock him as a privileged city boy with no clue what he’s doing. He stumbles from one farm to the next, debating work, God, and the treatment of sheep with stubborn, set-in-their-ways French sheep wranglers until he finally lands his big break herding in the idyllic Alps. While struggling to get a work visa, he meets a hot and charming bureaucrat who, even as she’s denying his paperwork, finds herself won over by his reckless sincerity. Shepherds is messy, earnest, and very, very French. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) BREE McKENNA Slanted USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Amy Wang Imagine if The Substance was about teenagers instead of adult celebrities, and instead of wanting to defy aging, it was about changing race. Slanted, the newest project from Amy Wang, centers on Joan Huang (Shirley Chang) and her pursuit of absolute assimilation: becoming prom queen. To fit in, Huang goes under the knife to change herself from Asian to white. Slanted mixes surrealism, slapstick comedy, and body horror. The people seem to love it—it won the Narrative Jury Award at SXSW— though they do say the middle drags a bit. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sons Denmark, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Gustav Möller Sons is the feel-bad film of the fest that, for all its bleak reflections about violence, punishment, and humanity, ends up saying surprisingly little. This is a shame, as writer-director Gustav Möller’s previous film, The Guilty (SIFF 2018), was a well-crafted work of genuine dread. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Sorry, Baby USA, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Eva Victor After her world is shattered by her advisor sexually assaulting her, grad student Agnes (writer and first-time director Eva Victor) attempts to regain control of her life while living in the same sleepy New England college town and taking a professor job at her school. Victor deftly navigates a minefield of a topic with humor, grace, and quiet but powerful authenticity, resisting clichés about survivors in favor of demonstrating the unexpected healing properties of stray kittens, kind strangers, and a really good sandwich. The heart of the film is Agnes’s unconditional relationship with her ride-or-die lesbian best friend Lydie (Naomi Ackie), who supports her throughout her recovery despite moving away and doesn’t hesitate to consider helping Agnes commit arson. Bottom line: An astonishing debut and an irrefutable case for more movies made by women about their experiences. Please see this film. (Closing Night: SIFF Cinema Downtown, May 24) JULIANNE BELL ★ Souleymane’s Story France, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Boris Lojkine He has no papers. He comes from Guinea. He is young (mid-20s) and Black. His name is Souleymane, and in two days, he must, during his application for asylum, convince French authorities that he was beaten and imprisoned in Guinea for his political views. The problem? He is not political at all. He came to Paris to work. And the work he does is at the bottom of the city’s gig economy: He delivers food orders on an electric bike. The biker can’t afford to be late or to get an order wrong because that would result in a bad review, and a bad review would result in the app shutting him out of the network and out of much-needed work. To make matters worse, he has to share half of his meager earnings with Emmanuel, whose face is used to open and operate the app (as Souleymane can’t legally work in France). The Paris we see during the dash from one order to the next is far from the one that draws millions of tourists. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22, May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Spermageddon Norway, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Tommy Wirkola and Rasmus A. Sivertsen I could call Spermageddon a big stupid cum joke. But that would be selling it short. It’s about ballsack, too. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18) VIVIAN McCALL ★ Starman USA, 2025 (85 min), Dir. Robert Stone Space exploration used to mean something, damn it. As of this writing, Katy Perry and co. just completed their bizarre 11-minute space trip bankrolled by the losers that are actively ending the planet we live on, so I got a kick out of hearing from Gentry Lee. Lee is a jet propulsion scientist, robotics engineer, and sci-fi author who has worked at NASA since the early ’70s and LOVES what he does. Lee yell-talks directly at the camera about his work on missions like Viking, marveling at how big of a deal it was to actually make it to Mars, and what it felt like to be in the room “solving problems that no one had ever had before” (we’re talking prodigies doing STEM with a fraction of the assistance of today). Starman isn’t saying anything new, but if you can get on Lee’s level, it is kind of mind-blowing to hear it told from a real one. Come for the gold Voyager record, stay for the footage of Carl Sagan slaying a turtleneck. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 17) EMILY NOKES Suburban Fury USA, 2024 (120 min) , Dir. Robinson Devor “There comes a point where the only way to make a statement is to pick up a gun,” says Sara Jane Moore, the woman who attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in 1975. Suburban Fury is directed by Robinson Devor, the same guy who brought us Zoo, with a little help from The Stranger’s own Charles Mudede. Devor gains historic access to Moore, who sheds light in an unpolished, often unreliable interview on how she went from a conservative suburban housewife to an FBI informant on radical political groups to an almost assassin. Suburban Fury tells Moore’s story at the same time it paints a picture of a decade of radical politics, braiding in footage of the Black Panthers, the Gay Liberation movement, the Attica Prison Rebellion, the United Farm Workers movement, and Patty Hearst’s kidnapping. Moore becomes convinced that killing Ford will expose the machinations of a government not for the people and inspire a revolution. While it centers on the 1970s, the political moment it captures doesn’t feel far off in 2025. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 21, May 23) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sudden Outbursts of Emotions Finland, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Paula Korva Sudden Outbursts of Emotions gets increasingly superficial the longer it carries on. It tells the story of a woman who, when not working at a travel agency, is burdened with soothing the fragile ego of her insecure boyfriend as his acting career seems to have stalled. She begins to question her life and relationship, just as said boyfriend suggests they open their relationship and attend a sex party where she meets someone new who will soon upend all she thought she knew about herself. At least, that’s what it feels like it ought to be, in theory. But the execution is far too narrow, and it’s oddly afraid to lay bare the body or the soul. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Summer’s Camera South Korea, 2025 (82 min), Dir. Divine Sung A young girl discovers a secret after developing film on her deceased father’s camera. She also realizes that she is a lesbian after taking photographs of her school’s popular soccer star. Either of those plots may sound like they contain drama, but the pacing is peaceful; at all the moments you might expect turmoil, there is instead a surprisingly frictionless story. It’s subtle. Maybe too subtle. But it’s very beautifully shot, tender in its understatement, and culminates in a truly moving final scene. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tales From the Magic Garden Czech Republic, 2025 (71 min), Dir.. David Súkup, Patrik Pašš, Leon Vidmar, and Jean-Claude Rozec LA stop-motion, ethereally animated movie about children trying to fill the void they feel after losing their grandmother, their family’s storyteller. Critics ponder who is the audience for this movie because it is definitely a children’s movie, but the subject matter is, well, kinda morbid. They also say it’s slow. However, a reviewer at Loud and Clear said it’s “a gorgeous stop-motion animated tale that’s both an ode to the resilience of children and a reminder that we’re never not going to need to feel safe and looked after.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Things You Kill Canada, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Alireza Khatami You don’t have to read interviews with writer and director Alireza Khatami to know that he’s a fan of David Lynch: It’s all over his work. It’s in the way he calmly bends reality; the way he turns a nameless Turkish city into a character in the film; and the way he kills his central characters. Most people have described The Things You Kill as a thriller, but I don’t think it has quite enough tension to earn that title. It does have relentless foreshadowing: a pistol tucked in a water tank, mirror images that become reality, the haunting phrase “kill the light” leaking from a nightmare. But the narrative itself is quiet and methodical. The unraveling of one man as he faces his own impotence, an ailing mother, an abusive father, and an impossible moral dilemma. (AMC Pacific Place May 23–24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ Time Travel Is Dangerous United Kingdom, 2024 (99 min), Dir. Chris Reading British besties Megan and Ruth run a vintage shop called Cha Cha Cha. They find a time machine in the alley and off they go, recklessly nicking items from any era they please to stock their shelves (and sometimes just to get takeaway from a closed restaurant). A group of inventors get involved because the machine is damaging the universe, of course. Listen, this film is deeply goofy. Almost every line of dialogue is a joke. I would not call the budget “big.” But the humor is British, which goes a long way—it’s styled as a mockumentary but is doing the tropes well enough that you’re legit enjoying the references? I was skeptical, I was, but then for whatever reason the more ridiculous shit they added, the more I thought, “yeah okay, swing big, why not.” The retro vibe is fun, and the characters are likeable. Just eat an edible, love. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24, streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tinā New Zealand, 2024 (103 min), Dir. Miki Magasiva Tinā (which means “mother” in Samoan) is part Sister Act 2 (with rich kids, though), part Samoan grief opera, and part slow-burn school drama set in post-earthquake Christchurch. After losing her daughter in the 2011 quake, Mareta—a grief-stricken but quietly formidable teacher—takes a job at a posh Catholic school where the students are privileged, the staff are casually racist, and the choir doesn’t yet exist. She builds one from scratch, connecting with emotionally closed-off kids while working through her own loss. There’s class tension, personal tragedy, and who doesn’t love when all roads in the high school movie lead to a high-stakes music competition? The pacing is slow, but the film is carried by Mareta’s low-key intensity and culminates in a genuinely very moving final performance. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) BREE McKENNA To a Land Unknown Greece, 2024 (106 min), Dir. Mahdi Fleifel This one looks dope, in a tense, traumatic way. To a Land Unknown is the story of Chatila, a Palestinian refugee living in Athens, and barely making ends meet. He’s caught in between existences—longing to get out of Athens and escape to journey while hovering on the periphery of Athens’ seedy underbelly. Chatila meets and connects with a variety of other refugees, people whom the audience may start to care for, only to eventually discard them for his own ends. As The Guardian writes, “[Director Mahdi Fleifel] allows us to invest in characters who are to disappear from the story, so we too can experience the emotional wasteland in which Chatila lives.” (AMC Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) NATHALIE GRAHAM ★ To Kill a Mongolian Horse Malaysia, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Xiaoxuan Jiang In the past few years, the contemporary Western has emerged as a genre whose best films are often directed by women, a welcome shift from the traditional Western’s realm of heteronormative and patriarchal values. Chloé Zhao’s The Rider and Jane Campion’s The Power Of The Dog come to mind, and with To Kill A Mongolian Horse, Xiaoxuan Jiang joins this pantheon in her directorial debut. Her film sets itself apart, though, by being set in her native Inner Mongolia (an autonomous region within China) rather than the American West. It’s a fascinating look at a man who is stuck between wanting to honor his culture’s traditions in a countryside that is rapidly changing, and trying to make a living in the modern city, a place he feels he doesn’t really belong. With modernity itself emerging as the metaphysical foe of the cowboy of the 21st century, the contemporary Western has become a much more complex genre than its traditional counterpart. (AMC Pacific Place May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Transfers Argentina, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Nicolás Gil Lavedra Transfers does not recount the full history of Argentina’s Dirty War period of 1976–83. Instead, this documentary focuses on one central and terrifying aspect of that military dictatorship’s reign: a biweekly series of “death flights” that dumped thousands of political prisoners to their brutal ends. By largely removing political pretext from the story—only brief mentions of socialism or communism—Transfers hammers home the utter depravity of the Argentinian regime for its actions, and also easily draws out metaphors for, er, certain modern regimes. Argentina’s administration freely destroyed internal records, lied to the media, and targeted mild offenses with brutality... but also enjoyed decades of relative impunity until persistent efforts turned up results. Those efforts are bravely recounted by remaining, living advocates in a crucial documentary that’s admittedly tough to watch, especially when victims’ mothers flood city streets to protest, only to become targets themselves. (SIFF Film Center May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Twinless USA, 2025 (100 min) , Dir. James Sweeney Fellas, is it gay to bond with a man over your shared grief after losing your twin while also pondering your place in a disconnected modern world? James Sweeney, the brilliant writer, director, and co-star of Twinless, says probably yes (complimentary), and so much more with this terrific dramedy that we can’t tell you almost anything about so as not to spoil the dark fun. What can be said is that Twinless sees Sweeney and Dylan O’Brien playing two troubled Portland guys who meet at an emotional support group for those who’ve lost an identical sibling. However, nothing is what it seems, and the film becomes the funniest, most chaotic, and ultimately most emotionally impactful movie to ever include key scenes surrounding attending Seattle Kraken games. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ U Are the Universe Ukraine, 2024 (101 min), Dir. Pavlo Ostrikov U Are the Universe is an indie drama about a man left adrift in space after the world as we know it is destroyed, who forms a connection with what may be the last other survivor. It’s creatively constructed and carves out its own distinct place in the well-worn genre, with the set design and visual effects proving remarkable, even before you learn that Ukrainian filmmaker Pavlo Ostrikov made it during the ongoing Russian invasion. It’s a love story of sorts with plenty of mirth, but also a mournful meditation, ripping the air from your lungs when it counts. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Unclickable Greece, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Babis Makridis Ad fraud, in which fraudsters show fake people fake websites that attract real ads for profit, may account for every third dollar spent on digital advertising, and it’s a hair-on-fire problem that director Babis Makridis lays squarely at the feet of Google and Facebook. The movie is convincing: I buy that ad fraud is a huge problem, likely killing local newspapers, funding misinformation, and plain ripping people off. For those reasons alone, governments should force big tech to deal with it. I also buy Makridis’s moral revulsion. But for a movie about what’s supposedly one of the biggest criminal schemes of our age, it’s boring, and the soundtrack (mostly fingers rocking back and forth between two notes on a Casio keyboard) nearly drove me insane. (SIFF Film Center May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Under the Volcano Poland, 2024 (102 min), Dir. Damian Kocur In Under the Volcano, a Ukrainian family’s chill beach trip to the Canary Islands turns existential overnight, as Russia launches its full-scale assault on Kyiv. While sunscreened Brits chug sangria nearby, Anastasiia, Roman, Sofiia, and Fedir spiral into panic, anxiety, and guilt while stranded in a paradise turned hellscape. Director Damian Kocur and co-writer Marta Konarzewska dial up the tension beautifully, letting family resentments bubble under the picture-perfect surface while in the shadow of a literal sleeping volcano. Through Gen Z daughter Sofiia’s eyes, we watch the strange numbness of survival unfold in real time. Grim, visually gorgeous, and timely as ever, Under the Volcano will hit you in your gut. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Undercover Spain, 2024 (118 min), Dir. Arantxa Echevarría Spanish thriller based on a true story! The late 1990s! A young female police officer in San Sebastian infiltrates the Basque terrorist group, ETA! Lead actress Carolina Yuste (known for Sky High—but not the Sky High Disney movie about a high school for superheroes) stuns, according to reviewers. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 20) NATHALIE GRAHAM Viktor Denmark, 2024 (89 min), Dir. Olivier Sarbil Viktor is a samurai-obsessed, deaf, Ukrainian photojournalist who wishes he were a soldier. Director Olivier Sarbil really, really wants you to know all that, but Viktor is at its best when Sarbil gets out of the way. Throughout (especially in the too-perfect ending) Sarbil and Viktor are telling us two separate stories, and I prefer Viktor’s. His sullenness clashes with the swelling music and close-ups of bombing victims’ hands in plastic bags. It’s refreshing—they may air raid you every night, but they’ll never take your freedom to be a little bitchy when you get a haircut you don’t like. If you want a straight documentary about this war, watch 20 Days in Mariupol. If you’re more of a vibes guy and it won’t piss you off to watch a film about a photographer who never once gives us a clear view of his photographs, Viktor’s worth your time. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 19; streaming May 26–June 1) BRIGID KENNEDY The Village Next to Paradise Somalia, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Mo Harawe A breakout from the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, The Village Next to Paradise delivers a “sensitive and empathetic” view of Somalia, “an underappreciated and often vilified nation.” The film centers on a family struggling to not only survive, but thrive in a village where drone strikes fill the sky and living until tomorrow never feels like a sure thing. (SIFF Film Center May 19, May 21) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Wailing Spain, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Pedro Martín-Calero Don’t confuse this with the Korean flick by the same name. This Wailing is a precise, stylized, femme-centered horror film. Martín-Calero—previously best known for directing a music video for the Weeknd—breaks the narrative into three distinct stories:, each led by a different young woman that’s stalked by (or stalking) something inescapable. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 25) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Waves Czech Republic, 2024 (131 min), Dir. Jiří Mádl While watching Waves, which is set in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, I got lost in its marvelous lighting and wardrobe. I could not get enough of both, scene after scene. True, the film’s story is relevant (journalists facing censorship or worse, dictators oppressing freedoms, and the like), but, ultimately, it didn’t say much more than this: “democracy dies in silence” (and, in this film, radio silence). (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Wolf Land USA, 2025 (71 min), Dir. Sarah Hoffman We should get this out of the way: Wolf Land is basically a dating profile for its featured player. Sure, the documentary thoughtfully explores the tension between wildlife advocates and ranchers, but then Daniel Curry’s mop of curly hair rides into the prairie, and, well, GOOSH. Tall, handsome, kind to animals, drops dad jokes, advocates intelligently for animal cohabitation, bridges political divides, and lives with his many pets (including three cutie-pie Dobermanns, who appear in a framed photo in his Eastern Washington cabin labeled “The Lads,” ARE YOU KIDDING ME). In good news, there’s more here, particularly how Curry and a rancher eke out a sweet, surprising friendship. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 18) SAM MACHKOVECH

On Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June. The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it is promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould. The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Steam on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a $39.99 USD Standard Edition, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a $74.99 Classic Edition that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game. If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a $199.99 Tail Time Edition, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please. Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which announced layoffs earlier this year - is assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot, and continuing work on an untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped.

Weather: Today will be mostly sunny with a high of 63 degrees. Enjoy it while it lasts, because the rain’s just backstage, doing vocal warm-ups for its big return in the next few days. Gates Foundation Calls It Quits: Mark your calendars for December 31, 2045. That’s when the Gates Foundation will be shutting its doors for good. Since 2000, they’ve thrown over $100 billion at public health and claimed to have cut worldwide childhood deaths in half, because nothing says progress like fixing problems with the same obscene wealth that helped create them. Bill Gates, in full humblebrag mode, told the New York Times, “We went from 10 million childhood deaths to five million,” and insists they’ll keep shrinking that number because apparently, “the Golden Rule was not repealed.” In the next 20 years, he plans to spend down the entire endowment of the foundation, and much of his personal wealth, he told the Times. Nothing says do unto others like hoarding enough cash to play God for a couple more decades before peacing out. Ferguson Signs Rent Cap: Well, lookie there, Governor Bob Ferguson can do something remotely progressive. Yesterday he signed a law capping rent hikes at 10% a year for most tenants, making Washington the third state to put rent stabilization on the books after Oregon and California. So now, landlords can only jack up rents by 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. New buildings (12 years old and younger) and certain owner-occupied properties are exempt. Most folks are celebrating because, hello, no more outrageous rent hikes, but others, like the landlord advocacy group Rental Housing Association, are freaking out, claiming it’ll kill the housing market. Right… Bottom line: it’s a win for renters, but we’re just scratching the surface of the housing crisis. Judge Says No to Libya Deportations: The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya—yes, Libya, the place that happens to have a Level 4 travel advisory for crime, terrorism, and armed conflict—using US military planes to ship people off like Amazon Prime for human suffering. Fortunately, a federal judge quickly reminded Terror 47 that shipping human beings off to a war zone without notice or a chance to contest it blatantly violates his order, but hey, when has the law ever slowed down the empire? Judge Brian Murphy, who had already blocked the administration from deporting people to countries other than their own, made it clear: “The Court sees none,” when it comes to any doubt that these deportations would break the law. Meanwhile, Libya itself is saying, “We never agreed to this,” but since when has consent ever mattered to Trump? Cops Who Killed Tyre Nichols Walk Free: Three former Memphis cops—Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith—just walked free on all state charges, including second-degree murder, for the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols. Now, let’s get this straight: they were convicted of witness tampering in federal court but somehow (mostly) skated on civil rights violations—because apparently, beating a man to death just isn’t quite enough evidence. Civil rights lawyers called it, “a devastating miscarriage of justice,” which is the polite way of saying, “What in the actual fuck?” Meanwhile, the DOJ found out Memphis cops have basically been running their own Fight Club with a badge—so maybe, just maybe, it’s time we stop acting shocked when the system does exactly what it was designed to do. We Got A New Pope: It’s official. This morning, white smoke billowed from the Vatican chimney, meaning we officially have a new pope. Behind locked doors, a conclave of 133 cardinals decided which one of them is holiest, like a cosmic game of Catholic bingo. Any minute now, he'll step onto that balcony, wave to the masses, and remind us that God is watching...but apparently only through their eyes. Stagflation Nation: The Fed just rang the stagflation alarm as the U.S. economy sags under Trump. Inflation’s creeping up, jobs are shaky, and the culprit—surprise!—is “volatile trade activity,” a.k.a. Trump’s tariff chaos. In a flailing attempt at distraction, Trump is hyping a sad little trade deal with the UK, while U.S. trade officials lean on countries battered by those same tariffs to make room for Starlink internet service, sold by Nazi-loving absent-daddy Elon Musk. DOGE Wants Your Data: In more Musk news, what could go wrong with a massive, centralized government database run by the Nazi-saluter? According to the Washington Post, Musk’s little doges are quietly hoarding personal information on Americans. Civil rights advocates and some federal employeees are are warning this isn't just hacker bait — it’s a handy little tool for targeting political enemies or screwing with access to public services. Columbia University Crackdown: On Tuesday night, more than 100 students at Columbia University occupied Butler Library, renaming it the Basel Al-Araj Popular University in honor of the slain Palestinian intellectual. Their demand: that Columbia divest from Israeli apartheid and genocide. The response: riot cops and repression. According to NBC News, NYPD and Columbia security trapped protesters inside the building and refused to let them leave unless they handed over their IDs. Protesters reportedly laughed at the demand. At least 78 people were detained. “We refuse to go down quietly,” said the students in a post-raid statement. UW Suspends 21 Students: The Columbia crackdown comes just as the University of Washington suspended 21 students accused of occupying a new engineering building in protest of the school’s partnership with Boeing, a company whose weapons have been used in Israel’s assault on Gaza. Police arrested at least 31 people during that occupation, with the university claiming "significant damage" to equipment—though no full estimate has been released. Some students are now banned from all UW campuses. Student group SUPER UW said in the social media statement that many students sustained injuries from the SPD, “some to the extent of hospitalization.” Adios High-Capacity Magazines: The Washington State Supreme Court just upheld the state’s ban on high-capacity magazines, shrugging off a lower court’s gripe that it was unconstitutional. In a 7-2 decision, the justices declared that magazines packing more than 10 rounds aren’t “arms” protected by state or federal constitutions, meaning the 2022 law stands—no buying or selling these ammo hogs in Washington, though you can still hang on to the ones you’ve got. Justice Charles Johnson wrote that high-capacity mags aren’t crucial for self-defense and Gov. Ferguson pointed out their outsized role in mass shootings and insisted that sensible gun laws don’t trample your right to pack heat. Maybe if you need 30 rounds to feel safe, the problem isn’t the magazine—it’s you. Medicaid Cuts Threaten Care Facilities: Trump’s cutting Medicaid, and guess what? Long-term care facilities in Washington, like Edmonds Care, might close, leaving millions of elderly and disabled folks out in the cold. A simple 5% cut would force massive layoffs and could shut down 65% of these places—people would have nowhere to go. And with the number of seniors needing care on the rise, this isn’t just bad, it’s a crisis. If you care about your fellow humans, maybe pick up the phone and tell your reps to stop treating human lives like they’re the damn Squid Game. From Real Housewives to Holocaust Memorial: So, Trump decided to swap out Biden’s picks for the Holocaust Memorial Council with his usual lineup of sycophants, including—wait for it—Real Housewives of New Jersey star Siggy Flicker. Yes, you heard that right. The same Siggy whose stepson was arrested for storming the Capitol on January 6th is now in charge of overseeing a museum dedicated to one of the darkest periods in human history. If you watched her on TV, you know she probably believes “Never Forget” is a trending hashtag, not a solemn mission. Behold, LimeGliders: Seattle is now the first city to roll out LimeGliders—scooters that look like bikes, because why not make transportation even more confusing? Lime’s betting big on the Emerald City to test out their latest and greatest, using our city’s hills, rain, and general weather chaos as the ultimate proving ground. So now you’ve got 3,000 of these LimeGliders on the streets, alongside e-bikes and stand-up scooters, all while we’re trying to stay at the top of the micromobility game. Just don’t forget your helmet, because when you inevitably eat it, at least you’ll have some protection while questioning your life choices! Next Step in Council Ethics Changes: Later today, the City Council’s Governance, Accountability & Economic Development Committee will be deliberating on whether to ditch the whole “recuse yourself if you’ve got skin in the game” rule. You know, that pesky ethics thing that says if you might make a few bucks off a vote, maybe don’t vote on it? Instead, they want council members to just disclose their conflicts and keep right on voting. It basically amounts to, “Yeah, I might get rich off this, but at least I told you first!” If you’re downtown today at 2 PM, maybe swing by City Hall, grab the mic during public comment, and remind them that ethics aren’t just vibes—they’re rules for a reason. Should the proposal pass out of committee, it could head to a full council vote as early as May 20. Yes, as I mentioned to kick off Slog AM, the sun is shining today, so it might feel a little odd to suggest a morning sing-along to "Can You Stand the Rain." But damn it, it’s R&B singer Desmon Dennis’ birthday, so shout out to him and his soulful cover of New Edition’s ultimate slow jam.

Title: Here’s why Trump killing the ‘AI diffusion rule’ is a win for chipmakers

Time Published: 2025-05-08T16:25:00Z

The U.S. government plans to withdraw a rule introduced under the Biden administration that had aimed to restrict exports of advanced AI chips — a policy that had posed challenges for major semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) and AMD (AMD+0.47%). “The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic and would stymie American innovation,” a spokeswoman from the Commerce Department said in a statement. The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios. The regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China. Chipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland. The shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively. But any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market. Nvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions. Last month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stocks Rip To 6-Week High And Bitcoin Prices Top $100,000 As Trump Stokes Rally

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. The stock and cryptocurrency market comeback from the tariff crash was in full swing Thursday, as President Donald Trump expanded investors’ risk appetite. Stocks have recovered all of their "Liberation Day" losses and then some. You better go out and buy stock now,” Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office. That direct encouragement accelerated an equity market rally which began as the president showed further inclination to back off of his most aggressive trade war plans and brandished a new trade deal with the U.K., the first such agreement of his second term. All three primary barometers of the U.S. stock market surged to multi week highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since April 2, the S&P 500 notched its top price since March 27 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq touched its highest level since March 26. The Dow rose 570 points, or 1.4%, by early afternoon, while the S&P climbed 1.4% and the Nasdaq popped 1.8%. Trump’s encouragement to buy stocks mirrored his messaging ahead of the 90-day pause he placed last month on the most aggressive of his country-by-country tariffs. Digital assets rode optimism of trade war deescalation to solid gains, as the three most valuable tokens – bitcoin, ether and XRP – each rose at least 3.9% in the 24-hour period ending midday Thursday. Bitcoin, by far the most valuable crypto asset, topped $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4 during the rally. All but one of the S&P’s 13 sectors gained Thursday, but it was the “magnificent seven” grouping of big tech companies championing the rally. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla were all up at least 0.8%, led by Tesla’s 4% gain, as the growth-focused septet enjoyed Wall Street’s move to risk. Bloomberg’s index tracking the seven stock rose 2%. The S&P tallied its longest winning streak in 21 years from April 22 through last Friday, erasing what was a 12% loss from April 2 through April 8 as Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs wreaked havoc. The benchmark is still down 7% from its February peak. The bounce comes even as Trump engages in a stare down with the U.S.’ top monetary policy official, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed declined to lower interest rates this week as it waits to see further evidence of how Trump’s tariffs will work their way through the economy, much to Trump’s dismay. Trump called Powell a “fool” and Thursday likened speaking with the central banker like “talking to a wall.”

Title: UK trade deal announcement brings hope to Wall Street

Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Thursday after President Donald Trump said he was set to announce an agreement on trade with the United Kingdom, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 was 0.6 percent higher in morning trading and on track for an 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 260 points, or 0.6 percent, as of 10:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8 percent higher. Stocks have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach deals with other countries that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump said Thursday that the U.K. agreement is “a full and comprehensive one.” WATCH: Trump announces trade deal with UK, cutting tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum “Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!” he added on his Truth Social account. It could be an encouraging start, and analysts said they’re curious to see if it will affect the 10 percent tariffs that Trump placed on all imports coming into the United States on “Liberation Day.” But bigger trading partners could offer bigger hurdles, including China. The world’s second-largest economy again on Thursday called on the United States to cancel its tariffs, ahead of high-level talks between the world’s two largest economies that could take place this weekend. That followed Trump saying on Wednesday that he wouldn’t reduce his 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 12.5 percent after joining the list. It benefited from strong growth for its software and services, and it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 2.7 percent after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Its stock fell 4.9 percent. “The global macroeconomic environment is volatile,” CEO Gavin Hattersley said. “Uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation, and currencies has pressured the beer industry and consumption trends.” It became the latest company to either lower or pull its financial forecasts for 2025 given the uncertainty. Krispy Kreme tumbled 19.5 percent after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of “macroeconomic softness” and because it’s pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald’s restaurants. The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple mixed reports on the economy Thursday did little to clear the caution. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. But another one said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected during the first three months of the year. That could keep upward pressure on inflation, when tariffs could be set to raise prices for all kinds of imported products. Treasury yields rose following the reports, and the 10-year yield climbed to 4.32 percent from 4.26 percent late Wednesday. In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 percent in London after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Indexes were modestly higher across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: BlackRock-Backed Securitize Raises Strategic Funding From Jump Crypto

Time Published: 2025-05-08T15:30:58Z
Full Content:
ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of Securitize Jump Crypto, the digital asset arm of Chicago quantitative trading firm Jump Trading, has taken a strategic stake in Miami-based Securitize, one of the leading platforms bringing real-world assets (RWAs) like Treasurys and private credit onto public blockchains. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This is the first outside investment in Securitize since BlackRock’s $47 million round last year, which cemented the firm as a cornerstone of the fast-growing tokenization market. Other blue-chip asset managers, including Apollo, Hamilton Lane and KKR, have also tapped Securitize to issue blockchain-based funds. These aren’t fringe crypto experiments. The funds tokenize mainstream products including Treasurys, private credit, and private equity on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the $10 trillion asset manager’s first blockchain-based vehicle, which also is Securitize’s marquee product, has become something of a bellwether of tokenization. Structured as a money market fund, it now manages $2.86 billion in assets. Since its debut just a little over a year ago, tokenized Treasury products have surged 800% to nearly $7 billion, a sign that the pitch is resonating with yield-hungry investors looking for alternatives to traditional wrappers. Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize “We think that the market should be digesting this investment really as a signal that firms like Jump now have conviction in not only tokenization, but the role and the impact that tokenization is having on capital markets, capital formation and investment accessibility on chain,” says Michael Sonneshein, Securitize's COO and former CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale. He argues that tokenization offers distinct advantages that legacy formats don’t match. Products like BUIDL, for instance, pay daily dividends, something traditional money market funds do not, and investors are increasingly choosing tokenized Treasurys over stablecoins as collateral, largely because tokenized products share yield with holders. In addition, pairing tokenized funds with decentralized finance opens new lending opportunities. Jump will help Securitize to do just that: expand the role of tokenized assets in collateral management and trading. The tokenization sector is growing fast. Since BUIDL’s launch, RWAs have more than doubled from about $9 billion in total value locked to $22.4 billion. Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market will balloon to $19 trillion by 2033. On Monday, the SEC's Crypto Task Force will host a roundtable on tokenization with issuers including Securitize. Meanwhile, the company is preparing its next act. In partnership with Lisbon-based Ethena Labs, it is about to launch a new blockchain called Converge. The idea is to create a compliant gateway for institutional capital into DeFi. Converge is expected to launch later this quarter.

Title: US and Russia seek ways to restore gas flows to Europe
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/05/08/us-and-russia-seek-ways-to-restore-gas-flows-to-europe/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T14:47:30Z

Officials from Washington and Moscow held discussions on the U.S. contribution to reviving Russian natural gas sales to Europe, eight sources familiar with the content of the talks told Reuters. Sources close to the bilateral talks said that carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union’s gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although much of Europe has sought alternative supplies, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is in place. As for Russia, nothing has hurt its economy more than the loss of most of the European gas market three years ago. Today Russia supplies 19% of Europe’s demand, up from 40%, consisting mostly of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some of it piped through Turkey via the TurkStream pipeline. Washington’s involvement in restoring gas sales could help Moscow overcome political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington by offering it the ability to see and possibly control to some extent the volumes of Russian gas that return to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said. From 2022, Europe has turned to other gas suppliers, including U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). U.S. envoy Steve Whitcoff and Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, have discussed gas as part of the Ukraine peace talks, two of the eight sources said. Whitkov’s spokesman declined to comment when asked if they had discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. “At present, there are no such discussions,” Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which Dmitriev heads, said in a statement to Reuters. As for how the Americans could get involved, five sources said that in talks so far there has been talk of U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline linking Russia to Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself. U.S. companies could also serve as buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and sending it to Europe, including Germany, the sources said. Two of the sources said diplomatic talks involving potential U.S. investors also considered the idea of a U.S. buyer taking Russian gas and then exporting it to Europe as a way to mitigate European political opposition to resuming supplies. BlackRock, Vanguard and Capital Group each own 1-2% of Gazprom. BlackRock, Vanguard and Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment. Capital Group declined to comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed opposition to a return to Russian energy supplies. “Some people still say we need to turn on the tap of Russian gas and oil again. This would be a mistake of historic proportions and we will never let it happen,” she told a European Parliament meeting on May 7. “Russia has proven, time and again, that it is not a reliable supplier.” Brussels wants to ban new Russian gas deals by the end of 2025 and ban imports under existing deals by the end of 2027. The plan, which will be debated next month, will require the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of member states. Hungary and Slovakia have expressed their opposition to the move. Trump has said he hopes for a peace deal on Ukraine soon and expects this will pave the way for both Russia and Ukraine to do major business with the U.S. Russia is ready to restart gas exports to Europe immediately if there is political will to do so, Putin said. Kiev and Washington signed a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal on April 30 that would include all natural resource assets and infrastructure owned by the Ukrainian government, but did not explicitly mention the pipeline. “If this level of engagement between Russia and the US continues, it is very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows… involving US intermediaries,” a person familiar with the discussions said. Gazprom, keen to revive its European sales, is considering offering German customers short-term 24-month contracts and big discounts on prices, two sources said. It has traditionally asked buyers to sign decades-old contracts, the two sources noted. However, the EU remains broadly opposed and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases pending regarding violations of old contracts.

Title: I shopped at Ollie's Bargain Outlet for the first time and found lower prices than at Target and Walmart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ollies-bargain-outlet-prices-shopping-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-08T14:32:05Z
Full Content:
When I mentioned that I planned to visit Ollie's Bargain Outlet for an article, several of my East Coast-based colleagues responded with some variation of "OMG I LOVE OLLIE'S." I'd never heard of Ollie's until the brand acquired 40 former Big Lots stores across the US in February, including four new locations in my home state of Wisconsin, but it appears to have cultivated a loyal following of bargain-hunters. Another indicator of the brand's staying power: as many brick-and-mortar stores downsize and struggle to stay afloat, Ollie's is one of the fastest-growing brands in the US in 2025, according to a Yelp report. Net sales grew 8% in the 2024 fiscal year to $2.27 billion, according to Ollie's latest earnings report. It also opened 50 new stores in the 2024 fiscal year, bringing its total to 559 stores in 31 states, and it plans to open 75 more locations by February 2026. President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs may also increase the popularity of discounted shopping locations, as consumers are expected to pay more for items such as groceries, electronics, and toys once they're implemented. I visited Ollie's to compare its prices to Target and Walmart and see if it lived up to its slogan of "Good stuff cheap." Take a look inside. All four new Ollie's locations in Wisconsin opened in February. There are no longer any Big Lots stores in Wisconsin after the brand closed 200 stores across 41 states in 2024. The carts appeared to contain mostly seasonal items such as summer-themed tumblers and beach towels for $2.99. It reminded me of the Bullseye's Playground section at Target containing items costing between $1 and $5. Ollie's, founded by Mark Butler, Mort Bernstein, Harry Coverman, and its namesake, Oliver "Ollie" Rosenberg, opened its first store in Pennsylvania in 1982. Its 100th store opened in 2011, and Ollie's became a publicly traded company in 2015. The walls at Ollie's were plastered with illustrated signs advertising the low prices in creative ways, such as "Caution: bargains ahead" with "Ollie" dressed as a construction worker, and "Knockout deals" showing the character wearing boxing gloves. Everywhere I turned, I saw another quirky sign that made me chuckle. Instead of selling the new releases and bestsellers I usually see at big-box chains, Ollie's stocked an eclectic collection of graphic novels, coffee table books, volumes of Bible studies, and picture books for kids. I thought the coffee table books in particular would make great inexpensive gifts. I found a giant book about baseball stadiums for $7.99 that the baseball enthusiasts in my life would love. In one of the grocery aisles filled with canned goods and condiments, many of the items were still in boxes. I recognized some brands, like Campbell's and Libby's, but others were new to me. Piles of boxes crowding a store can indicate understaffing and may deter customers from shopping if they have to squeeze through the aisles, Business Insider previously reported. Since most of the merchandise was shelved in cardboard boxes, this could have been more of a stylistic choice. I compared prices using the Target and Walmart apps on my phone while browsing the aisles at Ollie's. The same 8.9-ounce box of Cheerios costs $4.49 at Target and $3.68 at Walmart. A can costs $2.69 at Target. At Walmart, it was on sale for $2.48, which was still more expensive than Ollie's. That three-pack would cost $5.79 at Target and was listed for $12.80 on Walmart's website, though it's likely cheaper in-store. Ollie's keeps its prices low by buying closeout, irregular, discontinued, and overstock merchandise at a discount. The limited edition Dove body washes, which retailed for $4.99 at Ollie's, were no longer available at Target or Walmart. Other Dove body washes of the same size sell for $8.69 at Target and $7.97 at Walmart. A Black and Decker Crisp 'N Bake air fryer and toaster oven was priced at $39.99 at Ollie's, while a regular four-slice toaster oven cost $29.99. Target appeared to sell the same four-slice toaster oven for $29.99, matching Ollie's price, but it was difficult to compare prices for the air fryer since I didn't find exact matches on their websites. Perhaps the toaster-air fryer combination Ollie's had in stock was an older or discontinued model that is no longer sold in other locations. There were also new air conditioners for sale, like a 10,000 BTU window unit from Danby priced at $279.99. The exact design I saw no longer appears to be sold by Danby, though the company offers other units with the same cooling power for $429.99 and above. The raw flooring materials in the housewares section reminded me of Menard's, a Midwestern home-improvement chain frequented by contractors and DIYers and known for its mail-in rebate discounts. Laminate chestnut oak flooring cost 97 cents per square foot, while 5-foot by 7-foot Zephyr Collection rugs cost $99.99. Barbies ranged from $8.99 to $12.99 at Ollie's, which was less expensive than at other stores. For example, the "You Can Be Anything" teacher Barbie cost $8.99 at Ollie's compared to $14.99 at Target and $11.60 at Walmart. Toy prices are expected to increase due to Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Ollie's is a store with personality. The vibrant comic book-like signage and the treasure-hunting nature of sorting through the aisles made for an enjoyable outing. The prices were also lower than big-box competitors like Walmart and Target. I wouldn't necessarily shop at Ollie's if I needed a specific brand of cereal or shampoo since the inventory varies based on what discounted merchandise is available, but if I just need some "Good stuff cheap" once Trump's tariffs take effect, I'd definitely shop there again. When BI reached out to Walmart and Target about how their prices compare to Ollie's, a Walmart representative told BI: "At Walmart, we operate an every day low price model, in which we work to remove costs through efficiencies in our own operations and supply chain — to operate at an every day low cost (EDLC) so that we can in turn provide our customers with every low prices (EDLP). We constantly advocate for lower prices on behalf of our customers." Representatives for Target and Ollie's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jump to

Title: Mark Zuckerberg announces mind-control
URL: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/07/rah-rah-rasputin/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T13:20:53Z
Full Content:
Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Mark Zuckerberg has told investors how he plans to make back the tens of billions he's spending on AI: he's going to use it to make advertisements that can bypass our critical faculties and convince anyone to buy anything. In other words, Meta will make an AI mind-control ray and rent it out to grateful advertisers. Here, Zuck is fulfilling the fundamental duty of every CEO of every high-growth tech company: explaining how his company will continue to grow. These growth stories are key, because growth stocks trade at a huge premium relative to the stocks of "mature" companies. Every dollar Meta brings in boosts their share price to a much greater degree than the dollars earned by companies with similar rates of profit, but slower rates of growth. This premium represents a bet by investors that Meta will continue to grow, which means that the instant Meta stops growing, the value of its shares will plummet, to reflect the fact that it is a "mature" company, not a "growth" company. So Zuck needs to do everything he can to keep investors believing that Meta will continue to grow. After all, Zuck's key employees and top managers all take much (or even most!) of their compensation in Meta stock, which means that the instant the company stops growing, those workers' pay will plummet and they will seek employment elsewhere, depriving Meta of the workers it needs to successfully create or conquer a new market and once again become a growth stock. This is why Zuck keeps telling stories. The most important story Zuck tells is about himself, the boy genius who converted a tool for nonconsensually rating the fuckability of Harvard undergrads into a social media monopoly with four billion users. Zuck's cult of personality isn't the product of mere narcissism – it's a tool for creating the material conditions for ongoing investor confidence: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shirt-latin-what-does-it-say-explained-words-2024-9 If Zuck is a boy genius, then Zuck's pronouncements take on the character of prophesy. When Zuck announced the "pivot to video," investors poured tens of billions into Facebook stock and into video-first online news production, despite the fact that Zuck was obviously lying: https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html The "boy genius" story is an example of Silicon Valley's storied "reality distortion field," pioneered by Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Zuck is a Texas marksman, who fires a shotgun into the side of a barn and then draws a target around the holes. Jobs is remembered for his successes, and forgiven his (many, many) flops, and so is Zuck. The fact that pivot to video was well understood to have been a catastrophic scam didn't stop people from believing Zuck when he announced "metaverse." Zuck lost more than $70b on metaverse, but, being a boy genius Texas marksman, he is still able to inspire confidence from credulous investors. Zuck's AI initiatives generated huge interest in Meta's stock, with investors betting that Zuck would find ways to keep Meta's growth going, despite the fact that AI has the worst unit economics of any tech venture in living memory. AI is a business that gets more expensive as time goes on, and where the market's willingness to pay goes down over time. This makes the old dotcom economics of "losing money on every sale, but making it up in volume" look positively rosy: https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/ Now, Zuck has finally described how he's going to turn AI's terrible economics around: he's going to ask AI to design his advertisers' campaigns, and these will be so devastatingly effective that advertisers will pay a huge premium to advertise on Meta: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-revolution-is-an-advertising-revolution-morning-brief-100001467.html This narrative is especially galling because it's literally the same story Zuck has been telling for decades: "Facebook has built a mind-control ray out of Big Data, and we can sell anything to anyone": https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities This is a facially absurd proposition. After all, everyone who's ever claimed to have perfected mind-control – Rasputin, Mesmer, MK-ULTRA, neurolinguistic programming grifters and pathetic "pick up artists" – was a liar. Either they were lying to themselves, or to everyone else. Or both. But many of tech's critics helped sell this narrative (and thus helped Meta sell ads). Many critics have fallen prey to the sin of "criti-hype," Lee Vinsel's term for critiquing the claims of your adversary without bothering to ask whether they are true: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype The project of convincing investors that tech's "dopamine hackers" had perfected mind-control with warmed over, non-replicable Skinnerian behavior-mod techniques and mass surveillance sold a hell of a lot of ads. After all, if there's one kind of person the advertising sector has always been able to sell to, it's advertising executives, who are the easiest of marks for a story about how easy it is to trick the public into buying whatever you're selling: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost Every ad-tech sales-bro who takes a meeting with an advertising executive finds himself pushing on an open door. Advertisers desperately wants to believe in mind-control rays. Think of the department store magnate John Wannamaker, who said, "half my advertising spending is wasted – I just don't know which half." Imagine: some advertising exec convinced John Wannamaker that he was only wasting half of his advertising spending! I've long maintained that the threat from AI to workers isn't that AI can do your job – it's that an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete The corollary here is that it doesn't matter if AI can design ads that work, not so long as an AI ad salesman can sell this proposition to advertisers, and not so long as a tech CEO can sell it to investors. AI keeps passing the worst kinds of Turing tests – for example, it's great at convincing people who are prone to life-destroying hallucinations that they are talking to God: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/ Zuck kept up his growth story with this mind control narrative for more than a decade, got caught committing a string of spectacular frauds, and then lured investors back into his stock offerings by telling the same story. This isn't just an indictment of Zuck, it's a stinging rebuke to the whole idea that markets are a kind of infallible computer for assessing and operationalizing information. The market's "thought process" demonstrably lacks the object permanence that most babies acquire by the time they are a year old. You can tell when your child has acquired object permanence by the fact that they cease to enjoy "peek-a-boo" (object permanence means they understand where you have gone when your face is hidden). In claiming that AI will give him an infinite growth mind-control ray, Mark Zuckerberg is challenging the market to a game of peek-a-boo – and he's winning.

Title: Exclusive-US, Russia explore ways to restore Russian gas flows to Europe, sources say

Thursday, 08 May 2025 FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Leuna-Harze plant, a producer of chemical industry commodities, at the InfraLeuna industrial site, in Leuna, Germany, April 2, 2025. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -With a frost covering Europe's energy relations with Russia, officials from Washington and Moscow have held discussions about the U.S. helping to revive Russian gas sales to the continent, eight sources familiar with the talks have told Reuters. Europe slashed its imports of Russian gas following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a move that saw Russian exporter Gazprom post a $7 billion loss the following year. U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for peace in Ukraine, raising the prospects of a thaw in gas ties. Sources close to the bilateral discussions said carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union's gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Though much of Europe has sought alternative supply, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is agreed. As for Russia, nothing has hit its economy harder than the loss of most of Europe's gas market three years ago. It now supplies 19% of Europe's demand, down from 40%, mainly consisting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some piped via Turkey along the TurkStream pipeline. Washington's involvement in restoring the gas sales could help Moscow navigate political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington, giving it visibility, and possibly some control, over how much Russian gas returns to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said. Since 2022, Europe has turned to other gas providers, including U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, have held conversations about gas as part of Ukraine peace talks, two of the eight sources said. Witkoff's spokesperson declined to comment when asked if he discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. "Currently, there are no such discussions," Russia's Direct Investment Fund, headed by Dmitriev, said in a statement to Reuters. Gazprom would consider selling gas to Europe if a new owner took control of the gas network between Russia and Europe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told French magazine Le Point in April. On the route crossing the Baltic Sea Gazprom controls the two twin pipelines of Nord Stream 1 and 2 backed by European firms which hold stakes. Moscow is ready to trade its gas and knows that some European countries still want to buy it, Peskov said in the Le Point interview. "There is a gas seller, there are potential buyers," Peskov told reporters in April. Countries still buying include Hungary and Slovakia which receive gas through the TurkStream pipeline. Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Spain get LNG from Russia's Novatek under long-term contracts. Regarding how the Americans might get involved, five sources said talks to date have discussed U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself.U.S. firms could also serve as the buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and shipping it to Europe, including to Germany, the sources said. Two of the sources said diplomatic talks involving potential U.S. investors have also looked at the idea of a U.S. buyer taking Russian gas and then exporting it on to Europe as a way of alleviating European political opposition to resuming supplies. BlackRock, Vanguard and Capital Group each hold stakes of 1-2% in Gazprom. BlackRock, Vanguard and Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment. Capital Group declined to comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed her opposition to returning to Russian energy supplies. "Some are still saying that we should re-open the tap of Russian gas and oil. This would be a mistake of historic dimensions and we would never let it happen," she told a European Parliament session on May 7. "Russia has proven, time and again, that it is not a reliable supplier." Brussels wants to ban new Russian gas deals by the end of 2025 and ban imports under existing deals by the end of 2027. The plan, to be debated next month, would require approval from the European Parliament and a majority of member states. Hungary and Slovakia have expressed their opposition to the move. Trump has said he hopes for a Ukraine peace deal soon and expects this to pave the way for both Russia and Ukraine to do big business with the U.S. Russia is ready to restart gas exports to Europe immediately if there is political will to do so, Putin has said. Kyiv and Washington signed a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal on April 30 to include all Ukrainian government-owned natural resource assets and infrastructure but did not explicitly mention the pipeline. "If this level of engagement between Russia and the U.S. continues, it's very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows... involving U.S. intermediaries," said a person who is familiar with the discussions. Gazprom, keen to resurrect its European sales, is considering offering German clients short-term 24-month contracts and steep price discounts, two sources said. Traditionally it has asked buyers to sign contracts lasting decades, two sources noted. HURDLES Yet the EU remains broadly opposed, and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases hanging over breaches of legacy contracts. The Nord Stream pipelines were damaged in a sabotage attack in September 2022. Three of the four pipes were ruptured, leaving just one still able to pump gas. The war in Ukraine has also changed the situation, with Russian attacks damaging pipelines crossing Ukraine, though the key transit route remains in working order. A more technical matter is that Nord Stream 2 also never received German government approval to begin sending gas to Germany, a spokesperson from Germany's economy and energy ministry noted, declining to comment further.

Title: Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in a core business unit

More Google workers are leaving When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google has revealed yet another headcount reduction affecting around 200 workers in its global business unit (via Reuters). The workers come from a department responsible for sales and partnerships, with the redundancies part of a broader cost-cutting move with Google shifting its focus to data centers and AI – a true sign of the times. In a statement, Google said the changes would "drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve our customers." It is the latest in a series of announcements of job cuts at Google, after the company recently laid off several hundred workers across its Pixel and Android departments, with its HR department also affected earlier in February 2025. Still, that's not a patch on Google's widespread layoffs in January 2023, when 12,000 workers were sent home – about 6% of its global workforce. As of December 2024, Google had just over 183,000 workers, so while the reduction of 200 global business unit workers isn't significant in terms of percentage, it's still very much an unwelcome decision for all of those affected. Google isn't the only company making regular minor adjustments, either. Meta recently laid off around 100 employees in its reality labs unit, and a considerable 3,600 (5%) earlier in February when CEO Mark Zuckerberg told workers to prepare for an "intense year."

Happy almost Friday! Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer. In today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance. If you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo, what are you waiting for? What's on deck Markets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK. Tech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else. Business: People are fed up with companies' 'bait and switch pricing.' But first, can you Google ChatGPT this? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. AI giveth, and AI taketh. Google seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels. Apple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Cue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future. Google investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday. Cue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world. (Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.) The AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great, but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews. But as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable. It's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution. A very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up, writes BI's Matthew Fox. The company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion. IBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew. (If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo. Alistair Barr will be running the show, and he does a much better job of covering tech than me.) 1. Trump's first post-tariffs trade deal. The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been "continuing at pace" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday. 2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy. 3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed. His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture. 1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards, with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced. 2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content. 3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million. 1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway. 2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging, US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi. 3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using "bait-and-switch" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway. Paramount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.

U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with major indexes climbing. Tech led the day’s rally, and the Nasdaq closed up slightly over 1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.58% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.62%. The surge was brought on by President Trump’s announcement of a trade deal Thursday with the United Kingdom— his first since April’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs. In other White House news, Trump is also expected to roll back and replace Biden-era AI chip rules. Markets are absorbing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest remarks. The central bank announced Wednesday that it will hold interest rates steady, with Powell taking a wait-and-see stance. While the job market remains healthy and core inflation is easing, tariffs are introducing new economic uncertainty, Powell said. He made it clear the Fed is in no rush to shift course, emphasizing the need for more data — especially on how tariff-driven price pressures play out. Elsewhere, central banks abroad are cutting rates, but they’re not contending with the exact same inflationary wildcards. On Wednesday, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%) shares fell 7% on reports that Apple (AAPL-0.39%) may integrate AI tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity into Safari, threatening Google’s dominance as the browser’s default search engine. During federal antitrust testimony, Apple executive Eddy Cue said Safari search volume had declined for the first time — signaling that users are already shifting toward AI alternatives. With Google paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year for default status, the news rattled investors and sparked fresh concerns about Alphabet’s long-term search moat. Apple shares initially fell 2% on the same news, but both companies gained on Thursday, with Alphabet up 1.9% and Apple up 0.6%, too. AB InBev (BUD+0.91%) kicked off the earnings day with a solid report. The brewer posted nearly 8% EBITDA growth and stronger margins, even as volumes slipped 2.2% due to tough comps and weather. Mega-brands such as Corona — up 11% outside its home market — led the way, while no-alcohol and direct-to-consumer sales also notched meaningful gains. The company reiterated its 2025 outlook and emphasized ongoing investments in premium products and digital platforms. Shopify (SHOP-4.98%) reported before the bell today. Energy majors ConocoPhillips (COP-3.65%) and Cheniere Energy (LNG-3.98%) also announced earnings today, alongside Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ-2.47%) and Brookfield (BAM-1.97%), offering a look at global demand, margins, and infrastructure amid falling oil prices.

Title: Southern California’s Industrial Warehouse Market Plays an Anxious Waiting Game
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/05/california-ports-industrial-tariffs-port/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T10:00:05Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy In 2024, the bustling Port of Los Angeles processed 10.2 million shipping containers, the boat-born boxes that carry the goods of global trade. Measured via a stat called TEUs, the annual haul was the second-most in the port’s history and a 20 percent jump from the year before. This May, port watchers expect the harbor to be relatively quiet, as President Donald Trump’s tariffs — now 145 percent on Chinese goods — tank shipping volumes. The last cargo vessels from China that set sail before Trump began ramping up tariffs in early February have already docked, signaling the steep dropoff expected in trans-Pacific cargo. Port of L.A. Director Gene Seroka expects the number of ships to drop by 25 percent, with overall trade volume falling by a third. A report by Apollo Global Management suggests the levies will lead to empty store shelves, spur layoffs in the trucking and retail sector, and precipitate a recession in just a few months. The entire U.S. economy and supply chain has tried to adjust and brace for the impacts of the tariffs, and that includes Southern California’s industrial warehouses. The impacts on those will depend on factors such as tenant base and the duration of any higher tariffs. Few sectors remain as closely tied to the comings and goings of California’s ports than those warehouses. Roughly 13 percent of the GDP of the Greater L.A. region and $93.3 billion in tax revenue depends on shipping and logistics, according to a presentation by Stephen Cheung, president and CEO of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. More than 2,000 foreign-owned firms in this industry operate, and rent storage space, in and around the global commerce hub. Saying the region’s roughly 2 billion square feet of industrial real estate might be impacted is an understatement. Disrupting the trade on which warehouse construction and operation hinge could have a critical and long-term impact on the region’s economy. The day after the April 2 tariff announcements, warehouse giant Prologis’ share price dropped 9.6 percent. “This is like the Dodgers winning the World Series last year, and then just trading all their players and saying, ‘We’ll figure something out when the draft comes along,’” said former California Gov. Gray Davis on the logic of tariffs during the LAEDC call about the port slowdown. The owners and operators of industrial real estate in Southern California, while certainly anxious about the impact, haven’t hit the panic button yet, despite the prediction that port real estate will be particularly hard hit. Part of the reason is the diversity within the sector and SoCal itself. About 75 percent of logistics real estate demand in Southern California is tied to local and regional distribution, according to Prologis research. Authors of the Prologis report believe this “blend of uses — serving both import flows and end consumption — will help insulate the region’s logistics real estate from sharp swings in trade activity.” But, as tenants feel out tariff impacts and rework their real estate strategies, the entire sector — massive retail warehouses in the Inland Empire, port-adjacent property, and small last-mile delivery centers — still grapples with uncertainty. Jeff Jennison, president and CEO of Watson Land Company, told reporters that he’s seen South Bay industrial users, all solid credit tenants, hit pause starting in late April. “Decisions have stopped,” Jennison said, with meaningful expenditures delayed. “Most folks will delay any major decision-making if possible,” said David Fan, JLL’s Southern California senior research director. “A lot of major capital decisions, such as moving out or constructing a new facility, are wait and see.” The length of the tariffs, and whether they prove to be cudgels for trade deals, will impact different parts of the warehouse world differently. As Fan noted, large big-box retailers like Walmart have incredibly complex and detailed logistics operations. If the current scenario drags on — and it was dragging as Commercial Observer went to press — these retailers will be more apt to quickly reduce their footprint. Part of the response depends on how tariffs impact consumer spending and consumption. March data, Fan noted, showed an uptick, in part due to shoppers stocking up. A quick end to these charges, and trade deals that lock in certainty, could lead to soaring stocks, renewed spending, and a bullwhip effect where demand for warehouse space surges. “If you’re looking for big-box space that lends itself to 3PL, especially China, that’s going to be a tough go,” said Brett Turner, senior managing director of acquisitions and dispositions for BKM Capital Partners, which operates a portfolio of small-bay spaces. (3PL is the industry shorthand for third-party logistics.) “If you’re smaller, and your space lends itself to American manufacturing, I think you’re going to be in a really, really good spot.” Preparation also helps, and the warehouse industry has been bracing for impact for months. Chinese 3PL providers like Alibaba and JD.Com went on a leasing spree in anticipation of supply chain challenges. Such providers made up more than half of leasing activity in Los Angeles and the Inland Empire during the second half of 2024, and fully 80 percent in the fourth quarter alone. Coming after the regional warehouse industry had overbuilt and started to see the kind of depressed rents and slowdowns that signaled a (relative) space glut in 2023 — average vacancy was 2.7 percent in 2023, about half the 5.1 percent seen this year — this overzealous planning helped normalize the market, slashing vacancy and restoring supply-demand balance. The leasing activity during the first three months of 2025, 13.9 million square feet according to CBRE, was 62.5 percent higher than the same period last year and 20.7 percent over last year’s quarterly average. Coming after the COVID supply chain crises, which led to a shift toward stockpiling and safer supply chains — less just-in-time and more just-in-case — makes the industry more prepared. “COVID made these businesses realize that customer acquisition cost is hugely important, and if you screw up your supply chain and can’t deliver product to your customers, it’s going to cost you a lot of money,” BKM’s Turner said. “I think we’re pretty well prepared to go through this. I don’t know that it’s the best policy, and you can argue that all day, but if there’s a time that America can deal with it from an industrial supply standpoint, it’s now.” Fan also tracked end-of-year expansion from blue-chip clients and American retail firms, many of which felt bullish on the tax cuts and fiscal stimulus they expected from the then-incoming Trump administration. On its recent earnings calls, Prologis noted that companies like Amazon, Home Depot and FedEx have in recent months all been rushing in goods and seeking out overflow space. Deferred tenant decisions, in the short term, will impact net absorption rate in Q2 and beyond, predicted John Nahas, managing director of L.A.-based Rexford Industrial, which operates a 51 million-square-foot portfolio of smaller spaces in the region. He doesn’t see tariffs totally stalling the market — Rexford itself saw more absorption in Q1 than during the back half of last year — but the impact remains unpredictable. Tenants who have worked hard to establish supply chains won’t just jump out of leases, said Nahas, because there’s no tariff clause. His firm has roughly 11.2 percent of its portfolio subject to renewals in 2025, and he’s not alarmed. At the same time, many of the bigger tenants and big-box players will be attuned to the way tariffs hit American consumers. JLL’s Fan called the sector a sensitive barometer of economic activity, with retailers sure to rapidly adjust inventory and warehouse utilization. Right now, rents are declining, vacancies are increasing, and 6.6 million square feet of warehouses remain under construction in the Greater Los Angeles area, so significant shifts would ripple throughout the industry. “There’s been a higher percentage of economists saying there’s a higher chance of recession, and most of our markets are geared toward consumption rather than manufacturing,” he said. “To that extent, we will be impacted.” Fan said he’s keeping his eyes on the Chinese 3PL leases, which now lease about 4 percent of the total SoCal market. Since American consumers spend so much more than their overseas counterparts, Chinese firms are keen to establish more trade here, and have signed long-term leases during their recent attempt to shore up space. If tariffs last long enough for them to run through their pre-positioned inventory, their next moves will have a big impact. The fundamentals of the market could carry the sector through a sure-to-be unsteady year, Fan said. And the long-term push toward logistics efficiency will hopefully lead firms to make investments to optimize their delivery strategy — Amazon just announced a potential $15 billion nationwide investment in new facilities, for instance. Hopefully, faster, better and cheaper still matter. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Brazil’s President Confronts a Changing World
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/brazils-president-confronts-a-changing-world
Time Published: 2025-05-08T10:00:00Z

Not long ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met me in his office in Brasília and told me that he’d had a disturbing dream. In recent months, Lula had turned seventy-nine and undergone emergency surgery for a brain hemorrhage, and although he seemed fit and healthy when we met, he was in a reflective mood. He’d dreamed the night before about his predecessor José Sarney, who is now ninety-four years old. Sarney is a cherished figure in Brazil: in the nineteen-eighties, he became the country’s first President to take office after two decades of military rule. “In my dream, he came to my house and slept on the floor, and in the morning I made him breakfast,” Lula said. “I woke up worried, wondering if something had happened to him during the night.” The LedeReporting and commentary on what you need to know today. Sarney turned out to be fine, but it is no accident that Lula was concerned about an emblem of democracy. He told me that the entire Western system felt imperilled. “The democracy we learned to live with after World War Two, the functioning of multilateralism as an important role in relations between states, the respect for diversity, the sovereignty of each country is now fading,” he said. “What comes next, we don’t know.” The entire post-Second World War order, created largely through the intervention of the United States, seemed on the verge of collapse. “We thought we were creating a more civilized, more solidarity-based, more humane society,” he said. “The result is worse. It’s as if there is a lamp, and when you open the lid the evil people come out.” Lula has built a career on unwavering leftist principles, but he has also long prided himself on his ability to get along with a variety of leaders. Now, though, he confessed that he was flummoxed by the right-wing populists and anti-globalists gaining power around the world. At the United Nations General Assembly last September, he’d tried to organize a meeting of progressive Presidents. “When we sat down to make the list, I discovered there were no more progressives!” he said. In Latin America, only a small group of left-leaning leaders remains, including Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, Gabriel Boric, of Chile, and Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. “In order to keep the meeting from being too small, I changed ‘progressives’ to ‘democrats,’ so I could invite Biden, Macron, and other people,” Lula explained. “We’ve had two meetings since then, to discuss how to create a narrative to justify the importance of the democratic system as the best thing ever created for humanity’s coexistence—a system with rules, where everyone has rights, and someone’s rights end when they infringe on the rights of others. It’s what worked in the world. Monarchies, empires—they didn’t work. Nazism didn’t work. Stalin’s communism didn’t work.” In his country and in the U.S., he suggested, large portions of the populace seemed to have lost their grip on reality. “There are people who believe things that everyone should understand are lies, because they are so absurd,” he told me. “And my concern is how we are going to build a narrative to destroy this.” The troubling thing, he said, is that “we still don’t have an answer.” Part of the problem was economic, he said. “Democracy starts to fall when it no longer meets the people’s interests. Since 1980, the working people in countries that built welfare states have only lost, while income concentration has increased. So what response can we give to Brazilian society? And to German and American society?” There was also a question of leadership. “The U.S. was the mirror of democracy, the pillar of democracy for the planet,” he said. “Despite being the country that wages the most wars, it’s the country that talks the most about peace, the most about democracy. And yet now there is Trump, who sometimes behaves like—” Lula stopped himself, then continued. “I saw a speech of his in the U.S. Congress recently, and it was absurd—those Republicans clapping at whatever nonsense he said. It was almost the same kind of speech that anarchists used to make in Italy and Brazil at the beginning of the century, calling for a society without institutions, a society where the empire of capital rules.” President Donald Trump made clear his interventionist intentions toward Latin America as soon as he resumed office; in his Inaugural Address, he vowed to “retake” the Panama Canal. Since then, most leaders in the region have handled Washington with elaborate care. The right-wing populists strained to display their loyalty and affinity. Javier Milei—a hard-line libertarian who has slashed away half of Argentina’s government ministries—gave Elon Musk an engraved chainsaw and hailed Trump as “one of the two most relevant politicians on planet Earth.” (The other, of course, being Milei.) He has been rewarded with U.S. support for a twenty-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund loan, and with praise from Trump, who has said that Milei is doing “a fantastic job.” In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele offered to allow the U.S. to deport its undesirable migrants to his country, to be held in an appalling hellhole of a prison. When Bukele recently visited the Oval Office, he and Trump traded smug jokes about their arrangement, with Trump saying that he’d like to send “homegrowns,” too, and Bukele scoffing at the suggestion that he would return the wrongly deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Among the region’s leftist leaders, Colombia’s Petro was the first to resist Trump. After refusing to permit U.S. military planes carrying deportees to land in Colombia, he suggested on social media that Trump was a “white slaveowner,” while comparing himself to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, the doomed hero of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Trump retaliated by announcing punishing tariffs and a sweeping prohibition on U.S. visas for Colombian officials. Within hours, Petro had relented, and his humiliation provided an object lesson for other leaders. In March, a Hong Kong-based company named CK Hutchison Holdings agreed to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium led by the American investment company BlackRock. Trump quickly claimed that he was effectively reasserting control over the canal. Panama’s President, José Raúl Mulino, tried to salvage his dignity with defiant public statements, but he has mostly succumbed to pressure from D.C. Last month, Panama and the U.S. signed an expanded security-coöperation agreement that allows American armed forces to occupy several former military bases along the Canal Zone. In a joint statement on the new security relationship, released during a visit by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a sentence acknowledging U.S. respect for Panama’s sovereignty was pointedly excluded from the English-language version. Panamanians have grown frustrated. An influential friend there wrote to me, “Mulino has not stopped giving his ass to Trump at every turn, in exchange for nothing.” Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum, has made more convincing displays of composure, but she, too, has avoided confrontations with Trump by giving him what he wants. As my colleague Stephania Taladrid detailed recently, these efforts have included stepping up Mexico’s security presence at the border, handing over high-level narco-traffickers to the U.S., and significantly increasing seizures of fentanyl. Even Venezuela’s would-be revolutionary leader, President Nicolás Maduro, congratulated Trump for returning to the White House and agreed to hand over American prisoners from his country’s jails. After the Trump Administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to Bukele’s prison, Maduro issued a statement denouncing the action as “fascism”—but he was careful to address it to Bukele directly, rather than to Trump. Lula and Chile’s Boric have been the most outspoken Latin American leaders. On a recent state visit to India, Boric described Trump’s Inauguration, with Big Tech billionaires “paying fealty to a new wannabe emperor,” as reminiscent of “something from another era.” He criticized the tariffs as “irrational” and “unsustainable.” Although his country’s main export commodity, copper, had so far been exempted, Boric promised to seek out new trade deals with India, Japan, and others. He warned that if Trump did place tariffs on Chile’s copper—eleven per cent of which went to the U.S. last year—the higher cost would ultimately be passed on to American consumers. “The law of the strongest has short legs,” he said. Lula knows that his coalition is thin. In a recent speech, he said, “The Presidents of South American countries should understand that we are very weak if we are isolated.” When I saw him in Brasília, he made a plea for greater international coöperation. “We have to convince the world that it’s not possible to end multilateralism,” he said. “Multilateralism was a form of civility found among states to coexist peacefully, with rules that everyone must follow,” he went on. “It’s already proven that, if we don’t control the air, everyone will be a victim of air pollution. If the sea rises, everyone will be a victim. It hasn’t yet reached the world’s most important leaders that we need global governance to make some decisions globally.” Lula noted that the environment was among the most pressing global issues, but he also acknowledged the limits of multilateralism in dealing with it. This year, Brazil will host the COP30 climate conference, in the city of Belém—a location, at the edge of the Amazon, chosen to bring attention to the crisis of deforestation. Yet it is hard to imagine that it will bring radical change. European countries in particular seem likely to donate less as they scramble to devote more of their budgets to military expenditures. Lula shrugged this off. “I do not believe in money from developed countries,” he said. “They promised a hundred billion dollars in 2009, and they have not yet delivered. It has been sixteen years. Now the need is 1.3 trillion dollars—and they will not deliver.” Lula advocated a world in which the major powers could compete without resorting to warfare, and in which they coöperated more closely on such priorities as hunger and climate change. It was not lost on him that Brazil, as a developing economy, depends on maintaining friendly relations, even when it means partnering with countries with wildly divergent value systems. “We need to say: thank goodness we have China that, from a technological perspective, is very advanced and can compete in the technological world of A.I., giving us an alternative for this debate,” he said. In his telling, Western powers’ animosity toward China was spurred by trade, not by its human-rights abuses or its threats to invade Taiwan. “I am from a generation that learned in the nineteen-eighties, through Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, that the best thing for the world was globalization and free trade. Products should flow freely across the world. Money should flow freely across the world.” China, he said, had merely adopted this theory along with everyone else. “China started producing everything that was produced in the U.S. and Europe. You couldn’t buy a single pair of pants, shoes, or a shirt that didn’t say ‘Made in China.’ They very skillfully copied everything and learned how to produce things as well or better. Now that the Chinese have become competitive, they have become the world’s enemies,” he added testily. “And we don’t accept that. We don’t accept the idea of a second Cold War. We accept the idea that the more similar countries are—technologically and militarily advanced—the more they must talk to each other, because I’m not sure the planet can handle a Third World War.” Lula insists on pacifism in an idealistic way that is unusual among world leaders. “Last year, the world spent $2.4 trillion on weapons, while seven hundred and thirty million people go to sleep every night not knowing if they’ll have breakfast when they wake up,” he said. “That should be humanity’s main concern.” Even after Russia invaded Ukraine, he resisted taking sides. He described a recent meeting with the German Chancellor: “My friend Olaf Scholz came here, sat on that couch, and asked Brazil to sell missiles to him so he could send them to Ukraine. I told him I wouldn’t sell, with all due respect, because I didn’t want any Ukrainian or Russian to die with a Brazilian weapon.” Like some others on the left (and many on the right), he criticized the U.S. and Europe for funding efforts to confront Putin in Ukraine. “When you corner the enemy, you need to have the strength to defeat that enemy, and it’s not easy to defeat Russia,” Lula said. “I discussed this with Biden. And Biden kept saying, ‘We’re going to destroy Putin, and he’ll have to rebuild Ukraine.’ What’s going to happen now? If peace happens, organized by Trump, he will win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Europe will have to pay for NATO, will have to finance the war, and will have to rebuild Ukraine.” A few weeks earlier, Lula had urged Russia to halt the war. “I called Putin and I said, ‘Putin, I think it’s time for you to return to politics. Put an end to this. The world needs politics, not war. You’re missed. There are not enough people to sit around the table and discuss the fate of the planet: What do we want for humanity?’ ” Lula ridiculed Trump’s desire to take over Greenland and Canada. “The only thing left for him to take over is Antarctica,” he said. “Why do Russia and the U.S. want to increase their territories if they can’t even manage what they already have?” In his view, the global posturing by Trump, Vice-President J. D. Vance, and Musk was a serious threat. “They are deniers of the institutions that guarantee democracy worldwide,” he said. “The fact that the U.S. Vice-President interferes in Germany’s politics is already a crime. I have never gone to another country to interfere in an election!” He suggested that the bellicose rhetoric would eventually harm them. “At first, it may look good,” he said. “But the result could be much worse than what they are criticizing. When you release a wild beast, afterward you don’t know how to control it.” Not long before we talked, the U.S. government had announced a twenty-five-per-cent tariff on Brazilian steel. “There will be reciprocity,” Lula said. “But, before there is reciprocity, we want to show the U.S. what two hundred years of diplomatic and commercial relations between Brazil and the U.S. represents.” He pointed out that the U.S. had a seven-billion-dollar trade surplus with Brazil last year, the steel imports included. “What the U.S. imports from Brazil, they transform and then export back to Brazil,” he said. “It’s a two-way street, so I think this will be harmful to the U.S. For our part, we want to negotiate diplomatically. If there’s no possibility, we will take action.” When I asked Lula if Trump had reached out to him, he said no. “If, as a representative of the American state, he wants to talk to Lula, the representative of the Brazilian state, I will talk to him calmly,” he said. “But so far I haven’t had any interest in talking to him, either. If I ever have a problem and need to call him, I will call him.” ♦

IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights inflows despite Bitcoin’s 11.15% price drop and evolving custody framework. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It’s been a big quarter for BlackRock’s Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) with new custodians, Bitcoin volatility, a new regulatory landscape, and a pro-Bitcoin president. In its latest quarterly filing, BlackRock reported $47.78 billion in net assets at the end of Q1 2025, a decrease from $51.52 billion in the previous quarter. This decline tracks Bitcoin’s 11.15% price fall during the same period, affirming the ETF’s direct correlation to Bitcoin market performance. While Bitcoin’s price retreat impacted net asset value (NAV), the Trust’s underlying demand remained intact. Share issuances outpaced redemptions by 43 million during the quarter. The total number of outstanding shares reached 1.013 billion, reflecting sustained institutional interest despite market volatility. The NAV per share fell to $47.14 from $53.09. The largest NAV point during Q1 was $60.61 on January 21, with the lowest at $44.62 on March 10. However, as of press time, IBIT is trading at $56 in pre-market as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim $100,000. Operational costs during the quarter were modest relative to asset size. Sponsor fees totaled $33.04 million. BlackRock’s promotional fee waiver for the first $5 billion in AUM at a reduced rate of 0.12% cost the Trust $178,082 during the quarter, though this concession expired in January 2025. Coinbase Custody remained the Trust’s primary Bitcoin custodian. However, BlackRock expanded its custody framework in April 2025, appointing Anchorage Digital Bank under a new custodial services agreement. The move is to add redundancy to safeguard against counterparty and operational risks, especially as Coinbase has faced regulatory challenges. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase was dismissed in February 2025, which removed near-term legal uncertainty around the Trust’s key service provider. Market structure risks also surfaced throughout the filing. BlackRock detailed that Bitcoin sold to fund share redemptions resulted in $624 million in realized gains, evidencing the Trust’s liquidity efficiency. Nevertheless, the document extensively outlined regulatory and security vulnerabilities, including exposure to custody losses, market manipulation, and global regulatory shifts. U.S. initiatives such as President Trump’s March 2025 executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and pending congressional legislation to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over five years were noted as potential market catalysts and risks. The Trust’s custodial and counterparty arrangements are subject to liability limitations. Insurance policies maintained by Coinbase and Anchorage may be insufficient to cover extreme loss scenarios. Lastly, the ETF’s exposure to ongoing regulatory evolution remains central. The filing cited rising scrutiny from U.S. and global authorities, including FinCEN’s proposed rules on digital asset mixers and OFAC’s ongoing enforcement, as factors that could affect liquidity and market access. Ultimately, IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights a balance between robust inflows and market-related NAV compression, while offering an extensive view into how BlackRock manages structural, regulatory, and operational risks in the digital asset landscape.

Title: Bitcoin defies doubts at $98K, so why are investors still cautious?

BTC surges amid hopeful ETF inflows, but the market is still on edge. Despite Bitcoin’s [BTC] impressive hold above the $98K mark, investor sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. This brings along a wave of doubt that feels oddly out of place in a bull market. Is the market caught in disbelief, priming for a euphoric breakout? Or do these signals mirror the 2022 bear market? With BTC’s recent surge reigniting momentum, the current climate may be driven as much by psychology as by fundamentals. Recent data revealed a striking divergence between Bitcoin’s price and prevailing sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) and news platforms. Even with BTC trading confidently above $98K, the 7-day average sentiment remained firmly negative – a pattern historically associated with local bottoms and contrarian buying opportunities. Source: Alphractal This persistent disbelief suggests that the market is psychologically lagging behind price action. While such sentiment drops have previously preceded bullish reversals, it’s worth remembering the cautionary tale of 2022, where extended negativity coincided with a prolonged bear phase. A sharp shift is visible on the ETF flow chart: after weeks of consistent outflows, April ushered in a regime of substantial spot ETF inflows. This renewed institutional interest, primarily led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, appears to have reignited Bitcoin’s upward momentum, pushing it past the $98K mark. Source: Glassnode Unlike the volatile flows of earlier months, this phase shows steady daily net inflows, signaling strong long-term conviction. Institutional confidence may be the key force behind the surge, even as retail sentiment remains cautious. While ETF inflows signal optimism, history reminds investors to stay cautious. In 2022, bullish sentiment, driven by institutional products and macro trends, collapsed due to liquidity shocks and excess leverage. A sudden shift in risk appetite or regulatory pressures could trigger rapid outflows, reversing recent gains. Although ETFs offer transparency, they don’t shield Bitcoin from market volatility. If inflows slow or turn to redemptions, Bitcoin could face sell-offs similar to past cycles.

Title: Big Tech's new playbook: Trim the fat; pay the stars
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-giants-overhaul-pay-rewarding-stars-scrutinizing-underachievers-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-08T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Big Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat. The latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%. The move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams. These companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent. The changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over. "The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less," Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. "This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers." Google declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: "Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance." The new approach "creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles," an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers "multiple channels" for employees to raise concerns about pay. Amazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance. "Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase," one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. "This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level." At Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling. But with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind. "High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors," John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week. Microsoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls "low performers." Managers also received "more transparency and clarity" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year. Meta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a "non-regrettable attrition" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers — have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired. While these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers. In 2022, Amazon regularly offered over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers, according to data from Levels.fyi. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing "extra approvals" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added. Switching jobs no longer helps either. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023. Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power. Not everyone is sold that the shift to crack down on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because "others are doing them," cycling through similar changes every decade or so. "These are just fads," Capelli said. Still, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard, a photo of which was shared with BI. "No raise, no RSUs — thanks!" the whiteboard read, referring to the lack of employee stock awards. "Do more with less." Have a tip?

Title: Sell AMD Stock Amid China Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/08/sell-amd-stock-amid-china-risk/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 04: In this photo illustration, the logo of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ... More (AMD) is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a stock market chart in the background, on May 4, 2025, in Chongqing, China. AMD is a leading American semiconductor company known for its high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies, including CPUs and GPUs widely used in gaming, data centers, and AI applications. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock appears relatively costly at its current valuation of approximately $99. We have identified some minor issues with AMD stock that make the present valuation seem a bit high, although there are numerous opportunities as well. AMD recently released a set of Q1 results that surpassed expectations, and its outlook for Q2 was also more favorable than anticipated. Revenue increased by 36% to $7.44 billion in Q1, while earnings reached $0.96 per share. Growth was propelled by robust data center sales, which rose 57% to $3.7 billion, driven by a rise in GPU and CPU shipments. AMD's CPUs have been capturing market share from Intel in the data center sector for quite some time. While AMD’s GPU chips do not match Nvidia’s chips at the premium level, the AI boom is stimulating the entire market, with emerging large-scale models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and China’s DeepSeek R1 projected to generate increased demand for GPUs. AMD’s client segment experienced a revenue increase of 68% to $2.3 billion. Overall, AMD anticipates that new chips set to launch soon will aid in enhancing sales during the latter half of the year. However, China presents a challenge for the company. AMD expects that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a loss of $1.5 billion in revenue this year due to export restrictions imposed in April aimed at AMD's MI308 chips. AMD also warns of a potential charge of up to $800 million linked to inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves due to the newly enforced export controls. The new U.S. restrictions on chip sales necessitate a license to ship advanced artificial intelligence processors to China. AMD stated that it intends to apply for these export licenses, but it has also warned that there is no guarantee that these licenses will be approved. This presents a headwind for the stock since China constitutes about 24% of AMD's revenue. Our evaluation of Advanced Micro Devices against key metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains a strong operational performance and financial health, as elaborated below, although its valuation is somewhat elevated. That being said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and produced returns exceeding 91% since its inception. When considering what you are paying per dollar of sales or profit, AMD stock appears very pricey compared to the overall market. • Advanced Micro Devices has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.0 compared to a figure of 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 51.3 in comparison to 17.6 for the S&P 500 • In addition, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 95.0 versus the benchmark's 24.5 Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have seen significant growth in recent years. • Advanced Micro Devices has experienced its top line grow at an average rate of 17.8% over the past 3 years (compared to an increase of 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 13.7% from $23 billion to $26 billion over the last 12 months (compared to growth of 5.3% for the S&P 500) • Additionally, its quarterly revenues grew 24.2% to $7.7 billion in the most recent quarter compared to $6.2 billion a year ago (versus a 4.9% improvement for the S&P 500) Advanced Micro Devices’ profit margins are considerably worse than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • Advanced Micro Devices’ Operating Income for the last four quarters was $2.1 billion, which signifies a poor Operating Margin of 8.1% (in contrast to 13.1% for the S&P 500) • Advanced Micro Devices’ Operating Cash Flow (OCF) during this timeframe was $3.0 billion, indicative of a poor OCF Margin of 11.8% (versus 15.7% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter period, Advanced Micro Devices’ Net Income totaled $1.6 billion, which represents a poor Net Income Margin of 6.4% (while 11.3% for the S&P 500) Advanced Micro Devices’ balance sheet appears solid. • Advanced Micro Devices’ Debt figure was $2.2 billion at the close of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $160 billion (as of 5/6/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.4% (in comparison to 21.5% for the S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (inclusive of cash equivalents) accounts for $5.1 billion of the $69 billion in Total Assets for Advanced Micro Devices. This leads to a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (compared to 15.0% for the S&P 500) AMD stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the influence of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a comprehensive analysis of how the stock has behaved during and after prior market crashes. • AMD stock declined 65.4% from a peak of $161.91 on 29 November 2021 to $55.94 on 14 October 2022, whereas the S&P 500 experienced a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 January 2024 • Since that time, the stock has risen to a maximum of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and is currently trading at around $99 • AMD stock decreased 34.3% from a height of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough reduction of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020 • AMD stock dropped 91.2% from a high of $20.35 on 1 January 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, as opposed to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 21 August 2018 In conclusion, Advanced Micro Devices' performance across the various parameters elaborated above can be summarized as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Weak • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak • Overall: Neutral However, given its extremely high valuation, the stock appears relatively pricey, which reinforces our assertion that AMD is a costly stock to purchase. The elevated valuation of AMD stock restricts its upside potential in the near- to mid-term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver impressive returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced blend of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets take a downturn, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Google on May 6 laid off at least 200 people in sales and partnerships roles across its global business unit, according to a report by The Information, citing sources. The report was also carried by Reuters, who in a statement from the company reported that Google is “making small number of changes across teams”, which are aimed at increased collaboration and customer service. Notably, Silicon Valley tech giants are increasingly prioritising development of artificial intelligence (AI) and allocation for data centres that run their AI tools, while scaling back on other investments, the Reuters report added. Last month, on April 10, Google laid off hundreds of employees working in its platforms and devices division, which includes work on Android OS, Chrome browser, and Pixel phones, sources told The Information. On April 15, Business Standard reported that these jobs included some roles at Google's Bengaluru and Hyderabad offices. The sources cited in the report also claimed that Google plans to cut jobs in India across advertisement, marketing and sales. In a statement to The Information, a Google spokesperson said: “Since combining the Platforms and Devices teams last year, we’ve focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively and this included making some job reductions in addition to the voluntary exit program that we offered in January.” Since January 2023, Google has laid off at least 12,000 employees, or 6 per cent of its global workforce. This was announced by parent company Alphabet. As of December 2024, the tech giant had 1,83.323 employees, the report said. Alphabet is not alone. In January 2025, Mark Zuckerberg-led Facebook parent company Meta Platforms cut 5 per cent employees, it said were the “lowest performers”, it added. The company also announced increased hiring of machine learning engineers. In September 2024, Microsoft gave pink slips to 650 Xbox employees, while Apple cut 100 jobs, and Amazon laid off whole units last year, the Reuters report added.

'트럼프'는 "내일(현지시간 8일) 오전 10시 집무실에서 중요한 기자회견이 열린다"고 밝혔습니다. 스콧 베선트 미 재무장관은 'CNBC'와 인터뷰에서 "첫 번째로 무역 합의를 하는 나라 중 하나가 인도일 가능성이 큰 것으로 추정한다"고 말한 바가 있습니다. NYT는 7일(현지시간) "세 명의 관계자에 따르면 '영국'과 무역협정을 체결할 것이라고 발표할 것"이라고 전했습니다. 'NYT 보도에' 따르면 '트럼프' 행정부는 무역 협정의 일환으로 10%의 '상호관세'(보편적 관세)를 제거하는 것을 고려하지 않고 있다고 전해졌습니다.

'건설 부문'이 4개월 연속 위축된 '영국'은 '영란은행'(BoE)의 '금리인하' 기대감이 커지는 중입니다. 환율이 하락하면 '수출'이 감소하고 '나쁜 디플레이션'이 나타납니다. 수출이 감소하면 기업 실적이 감소합니다. 영국의 경우 '주식', 채권·부동산 중에 국채금리가 치솟았던 길트 수익률이 나올 수 있습니다. 한국 증시는 '외국인' 투자자들이 '주식'을 '공매도'처서 수익을 내고 국채를 '폭풍 쇼핑'을 했습니다. 선물환 계약, 통화 스왑, 옵션 등 다양한 '금융 상품'을 활용해 '환 헤지'(달러 하락 예상 vs 환차익 : 달러 상승 예상)가 수익률에 도움이 '될 수' 있습니다.

'캐리 트레이드'의 폭발은 '중앙은행'에 더 큰 달러 문제를 의미합니다. 최근 며칠 동안 대만 달러의 가치는 '급등'했습니다. 이는 대만의 정상적인 환율을 고려할 때 거의 '전례 없는' 움직임입니다. 대만과 '외국인' 투자자들에게 미치는 영향은 무엇일까요? 대만 달러의 급등으로 글로벌 기술 공급망의 근간을 이루는 '현지 기업'의 경쟁력과 '수익 전망'에 대한 우려가 커지고 있습니다.

Title: Supply chain collapse looms as U.S.-China trade war reaches ‘extinction-level’ crisis: Store shelves will empty like never before

Key points: Supply chain expert warns of "asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs" disruption as U.S.-China trade war escalates Chinese imports to US expected to plunge 80%, triggering historic shortages, price spikes, and mass layoffs Trump's 25% auto parts tariffs deepen crisis as experts warn: "Even if a deal happens, recovery could take a year" Southern California's port-dependent economy faces devastation, with "one in five jobs" at risk The U.S. and much of the industrialized world are now entrenched in a historic trade war â a conflict intensified by President Donald Trumpâs policies but ultimately inevitable due to past U.S. administrations losing key negotiations with other nations. These earlier failures set the stage for economic decline, as businesses shuttered and corporations relocated overseas in search of more favorable conditions. Now, in a desperate bid for survival, the U.S. government is waging high-stakes trade battles, deploying aggressive tariffs to pressure other nations into compliance. This strategy underscores the dollarâs weakening dominance and the decline of American manufacturing, as countries increasingly abandon reliance on the worldâs reserve currency to forge their own economic alliances. The coming supply chain apocalypse The warning signs are already flashing red. Container shipments from China to the U.S. have plummeted 60% since April, with major retailers now burning through stockpiled inventory. Once those reserves vanish â likely within weeks â Americans will face barren shelves, rationing, and hyperinflation on everyday goods. Smaller businesses, already struggling, are the canaries in the coal mine. The crisis is exacerbated by decades of U.S, economic malpractice, where corrupt administrations outsourced critical manufacturing to China, leaving the nation defenseless. Now, as Trumpâs tariffs sever trade ties, thereâs no quick fix. "It takes years to build new factories," notes one analyst. "How do we replace $438 billion in Chinese imports?" The answer: We canât. Economic carnage and the betrayal of American workers Southern Californiaâs ports â the lifeline of U.S. commerce â are ground zero for the coming disaster. Gary Herrera of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union warns that "one in every five jobs" in the region is tied to port activity, with ripple effects crushing warehouse workers, truckers, and rail operators. The Inland Empire, a hub for Walmart and Amazon, faces economic ruin. Even if Trump secures a deal tomorrow, supply chains wonât recover for 9â12 months, says Altana Technologies CEO Evan Smith. But China refuses to negotiate under coercion, and Trumpâs latest tariffs â like the auto parts levy â signal no retreat. "The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system," Smith adds, "and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain." A nation on the brink: Prepare now or suffer later This is not a drill. The global trade war has arrived, and its consequences will dwarf the COVID-era disruptions. The Federal Reserveâs reckless money-printing has already devalued the dollar, and now, supply chain chaos will ignite inflation like a powder keg. Those who fail to prepare â stockpiling essentials, securing alternative income, or converting savings to gold â will be left at the mercy of a collapsing system. As the radical left fuels unrest and the deep state plots its next move, one truth is undeniable: The America we knew is gone. Will this crisis finally awaken the public to the corruption that brought us here â or will they keep rioting, looting, and begging for government handouts as the shelves go bare? Additional Reading: Why the Trump administration will FAIL, and Americaâs economy, military and industrial base will COLLAPSE if Trumpâs weaponized tariffs arenât halted.

Those who fail to prepare â stockpiling essentials, securing alternative income, or converting savings to gold â will be left at the mercy of a collapsing system. As the radical left fuels unrest and the deep state plots its next move, one truth is undeniable: The America we knew is gone.

Sources include: TheEconomicCollapseBlog.com Preparedness.news Preparedness.news Now, in a desperate bid for survival, the U.S. government is waging high-stakes trade battles, deploying aggressive tariffs to pressure other nations into compliance. This strategy underscores the dollarâs weakening dominance and the decline of American manufacturing, as countries increasingly abandon reliance on the worldâs reserve currency to forge their own economic alliances. The coming supply chain apocalypse The warning signs are already flashing red. Container shipments from China to the U.S. have plummeted 60% since April, with major retailers now burning through stockpiled inventory. Once those reserves vanish â likely within weeks â Americans will face barren shelves, rationing, and hyperinflation on everyday goods. Smaller businesses, already struggling, are the canaries in the coal mine. The crisis is exacerbated by decades of U.S, economic malpractice, where corrupt administrations outsourced critical manufacturing to China, leaving the nation defenseless. Now, as Trumpâs tariffs sever trade ties, thereâs no quick fix. "It takes years to build new factories," notes one analyst. "How do we replace $438 billion in Chinese imports?" The answer: We canât. Economic carnage and the betrayal of American workers Southern Californiaâs ports â the lifeline of U.S. commerce â are ground zero for the coming disaster. Gary Herrera of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union warns that "one in every five jobs" in the region is tied to port activity, with ripple effects crushing warehouse workers, truckers, and rail operators. The Inland Empire, a hub for Walmart and Amazon, faces economic ruin. Even if Trump secures a deal tomorrow, supply chains wonât recover for 9â12 months, says Altana Technologies CEO Evan Smith. But China refuses to negotiate under coercion, and Trumpâs latest tariffs â like the auto parts levy â signal no retreat. "The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system," Smith adds, "and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain."

Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-network-activity-drops-to-bear-market-levels-red-flag-or-buy-signal/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

Trump’s tariff plan has pushed America’s businesses into a nightmarish experiment.

Maxwell Cohen knew the tariffs were coming. President Donald Trump had openly threatened a trade war on the campaign trail, and Cohen, an entrepreneur, heeded his words. His company, Peelaways, sells disposable and waterproof fitted bed sheets made in China that are popular with at-home and family caregivers. There’s only so much price elasticity for disposable goods, so he prepared to absorb what he estimated would be roughly 15 to 30 percent tariffs, setting aside money to bring in more inventory before prices skyrocketed. It would hurt, but it would be doable. He thought he had the numbers mostly worked out. But when man plans, Trump laughs. The latest figure for the administration’s tariffs on China sits at 145 percent. Prices are expected to keep climbing for some goods; last week, Trump closed the de minimis loophole for China and Hong Kong, which had exempted them from paying tariffs on shipments of goods worth $800 or less, and wide-ranging tariffs are still set to go into effect for many countries. For any business that can’t swallow an unanticipated and possibly huge price increase on imports, the first step is deciding if it will pass the cost to the consumer. If the answer is yes—as it often is—the next decision is how, or whether, to let the customers know. Tariff transparency recently made headlines on the domestic front of Trump’s trade war. After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line showing the cost of tariffs for each product on its site, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held a public shaming of the company from her briefing-room podium, calling the move “a hostile and political act.” CNN reported that a “pissed” Trump called Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder. The company’s representatives soon denied ever approving the idea, adding that it was never a consideration for Amazon’s main site but rather for its spin-off store, Haul. Although big, name-brand American companies are most likely to incur the administration’s wrath over displaying tariff surcharges, other businesses have tough choices to make on how to go about raising prices. The result is a choose-your-own-adventure exercise in managing public perception. Screenshots of the checkout page of the online clothing company Triangl went viral for the astronomical “duties” surcharge. Temu, a Chinese e-commerce giant, added import charges to certain products on its site. Luxury brands aren’t immune, either: Hermès announced price increases for American buyers to offset the tariffs, and Prada plans to raise prices by an undetermined amount later in the summer. Meanwhile, some business leaders aren’t mincing words. Jolie Skin Co, an American shower-filter brand, told The Information that a “Trump liberation tariff” line will be added to checkout pages. “Technically WE are not raising our prices,” the company’s CEO and founder, Ryan Babenzien, wrote on LinkedIn. “We think transparency is the way to go here and I am giving Trump full credit for his decision.” Transparency is a high-wire act. Tariffs is such a politically loaded word that some companies hesitate to invoke it, out of fear of alienating their customer base—or inciting the administration’s ire. But pointing a finger at tariffs can also help shift blame. Increasing prices without any clear explanation risks appearing opportunistic, Mike Michalowicz, a small-business expert, told me. All it takes is for some businesses to get caught profiteering before “the customer becomes suspect of not just them but of everybody.” The gaming industry is a prime example. Nintendo has a large manufacturing presence in China, and last month, it announced that the Switch 2 console would launch at the original price, but some of the accessories will cost more than previously expected. The company’s representatives attributed the update to “changes in market conditions.” If that phrase sounds familiar, it’s almost word for word the explanation Microsoft offered after announcing Xbox price hikes last week, which will run as high as $100 more for some models in America. The absence of the T-word is a glaring omission. Such muddy messaging may help insulate companies from the administration’s spite, but it invites backlash from customers who are quick to blame the good old-fashioned motive of corporate greed. If some companies fear appearing opportunistic, others are trying to cash in while they still can. Marketing 101 teaches you to distinguish your company from your competitors, and Business 101 says to move inventory before the economy goes kaput. What better way to do both than to slash prices when everybody else is raising them? “Pre-tariff” sales are cropping up at furniture companies, fashion retailers, and carmakers. Their underlying message: Get it before you can’t afford it. Ford’s latest campaign, “From America. For America,” is trying to strike an optimistic tone. As Audi pauses car imports to the United States, and automakers hem and haw over price changes, Ford has been running an ad since last month touting employee-priced vehicles and their company’s deep roots in American industry. It’s a strategic ploy—already, Ford has reported double-digit sales increases (although an analysis from CarEdge found that some of Ford’s more popular vehicles had better deals in March, before employee pricing went into effect). Other carmakers that manufacture models in America, including Mercedes and BMW, are promising to temporarily eat the cost of tariffs for some vehicles to keep prices from rising. But an expiration date for this generosity could be imminent: Last week, Ford’s CEO went on CNN and couldn’t say if prices would increase in the summertime. With so much left uncertain in Trump’s trade war, some small businesses are down to the wire. Many of them don’t have the cash to stockpile inventory or the storage space to keep it. The owners of the American vegan-cheese company Rebel Cheese have roughly a month to decide what to do. Much of their cheese relies on fair-trade cashews imported from Vietnam, which faces the threat of 46 percent tariffs, and their inventory is dwindling. The company already went through a round of layoffs a few weeks ago; at this point, adding at least a 10 percent price increase seems inevitable, Fred Zwar, one of the co-founders, told me. They are considering breaking down the numbers for customers when they announce the change, but the sharp fluctuations of Trump’s tariffs make the timing tricky: “We can’t do a price raise today and then say, Hey, they raised it another 90 percent. We need to do another price raise tomorrow,” Zwar said. All of this feels like déjà vu for Peelaways. Cohen dealt with Trump’s seesawing tariffs during his first term, which also coincided with COVID-19’s economic downturn. He laid off all six of his workers and restructured his business in order to stay afloat, leaving him with two C-suite executives overseas. This time around, he’s running a leaner operation and slowly raising prices $1 a week until he hits a 15 percent increase. His plan is to test different newsletters to measure his customer base’s feedback: One will include the standard fare (caregiver tips, customer reviews), and the other will acknowledge the tariffs’ effects on pricing. But even having gone through this before, Cohen can’t be sure he’ll make it out again. “We’re all just holding our breath,” he said, waiting for “whatever the next tweet brings.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Evening Read The Real Motive Behind the Real ID–Deadline Charade By Juliette Kayyem Today’s deadline was largely artificial: According to the fine print of the regulations governing Real ID’s implementation, Homeland Security has until the end of 2027 to phase in the program in full.

Arm Holdings (ARM) delivered an outlook that came in below analysts' expectations, sending shares lower in extended trading Wednesday. The chip designer and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it anticipates fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents to 38 cents, short of the 41 cents called for by Wall Street, according to Visible Alpha. Arm's revenue forecast, of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, was also lower than the analyst consensus at the midpoint of its range. Arm shares fell some 9% in after-hours trading. The stock is up less than 1% so far in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. In its fiscal fourth quarter, Arm posted record revenue of $1.24 billion, up 34% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted net income was $584 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $376 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier, surpassing Wall Street’s estimates. Arm's royalty revenue improved 18% to a record $607 million, while its license and other revenue gained 53% to $634 million.

Title: Parents concerned as embattled childcare provider Genius still without buyer

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:Child Care As troubled childcare provider Genius continues to battle financial woes, the future of its childcare centres remain in limbo. (ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.

Shares in Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) are dipping sharply amid comments from tech giant Apple suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) will threaten the dominance of the top search engine. Apple’s services chief Eddie Cue says he believes AI-run search engines will eventually replace the classic search engines like Google, Bloomberg reports. Speaking in a testimony during the US Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc, Cue said he expects Apple will use services from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic as search options in Apple’s Safari browser in the future. “Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices… I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.” Currently, Google has been paying Apple as much as $20 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser. Following Cue’s testimony and the subsequent uncertainty of Google’s future dominance, the tech giant’s stock collapsed, wiping out over $200 billion in market cap. At time of writing, GOOG is down 10.4% on the day, currently trading at $149. Cue added that for AI search engines to improve, they will need better indexing, but even if they can’t achieve that, they will likely soon have features that are “so much better that people will switch.” Says Cue, referring to the switch from standard to AI-based search engines, “There’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares slid Wednesday, a day after the cybersecurity company said in a regulatory filing it plans to cut roughly 500 jobs, or 5% of its workforce. CrowdStrike "continues to scale its business with focus and discipline" toward a target of $10 billion in ending annual recurring revenue (ARR), it said Tuesday. In March, the company reported ending ARR of $4.24 billion as of Jan. 31. CrowdStrike expects to incur between $36 million and $53 million in layoff-related charges, including $7 million in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, the filing said. The company plans to report current-quarter results on June 3, with those charges excluded from its adjusted figures. The company added it sees Q1 results "in-line with or above" its March guidance and affirmed its full-year outlook. In a letter to employees, CEO George Kurtz said CrowdStrike is at a "market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry." "AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster," Kurtz added. "It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office." Shares of CrowdStrike fell 5% in recent trading but are up 23% in 2025.

Title: Saylor Pressures Microsoft To Join Bitcoin Revolution With $75 Billion Bet
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-microsoft-bitcoin-75-billion-bet/
Time Published: 2025-05-07T14:30:05Z
Full Content:
At the Bitcoin for Corporations 2025, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor turned his keynote into a direct challenge for one of the technology sector’s most cash-rich giants. Speaking to an audience of chief financial officers and treasury executives, he argued that Microsoft should shift tens of billions of dollars from share buybacks and short-dated Treasuries into Bitcoin, calling the cryptocurrency “the universal, perpetual, profitable merger partner” that outclasses every other treasury asset in the artificial-intelligence age. Saylor framed the comparison starkly. “Microsoft is up 18% a year for the past five years. Bitcoin is up 62%,” he said, adding that the S&P 500’s compound growth rate of roughly 14% defines the hurdle rate by which corporate capital allocation is judged. “Normalize everything against that cost of capital and you discover Microsoft’s real out-performance is 4%. Bitcoin’s is 48%. Bonds are negative. Why would you hold the thing that’s destroying capital when the apex asset is compounding almost 50% above the cost of money?” He then zeroed in on Microsoft’s current balance sheet mix. “If Microsoft buys bonds, you’re destroying 99.7% of your capital over ten years,” he declared. “Buying your own stock is only marginally less catastrophic—you’re vaporizing 97%. Buying Bitcoin would be ten times better than buying back MSFT.” Saylor’s argument rests on his conviction that Bitcoin inaugurates a third monetary epoch. “Gold was nineteenth-century money; sovereign debt was twentieth-century money. Bitcoin is twenty-first-century money—the first liquid, fungible capital asset with no counterparty,” he said. He dates the institutional “year zero” for Bitcoin to 2024, “the moment the SEC blessed spot ETFs and FASB signaled fair-value accounting.” By that chronology, 2025 is “year one” and the window for first-mover advantage is already narrowing. To quantify the upside, Saylor revealed that his team ran Microsoft through the open-source “Bitcoin 24” treasury-modeling tool. Four scenarios were stress-tested: sweeping excess cash into Bitcoin, substituting dividends for coin purchases, replacing buybacks with accumulation, and adding a thin layer of leverage. “Depending on the mix, it adds anywhere from $155 to $584 a share—one to five trillion dollars in enterprise value—while taking less risk,” he said. “I’m asking you to stop surrendering the capital you just spent five years winning.” The emotionally charged moments of the keynote came when Saylor linked treasury policy to operational strain. “When you divest yourself of $200 billion, you amplify every risk factor in your own prospectus,” he warned. “You put massive pressure on your employees, then on your customers—lock them into three-year contracts, force them to buy everything when they only want some things—then your competitors complain and the regulators sue you. All of it because you’re chasing quarterly volatility you could hedge instantly by holding a non-correlated hard asset.” He pressed the point with a thought experiment aimed squarely at Microsoft’s board. “If you could buy a hundred-billion-dollar company growing 60% a year at one-times revenue, would you do it? What if you could do it every year, forever?” he asked. “That’s Bitcoin. The irony is that the least risky acquisition imaginable is perceived as risky by consensus finance.” 🇺🇸 MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST CALLED MICROSOFT TO BUY $75 BILLION OF #BITCOIN AND MAKE $4 TRILLION IT’S COMING!!! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/ujyHwquA0e — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 6, 2025 Saylor reserved his longest uninterrupted passage for a final appeal: “Rich people are not rich because of a future expectation of cash flows; they’re rich because they own hard assets. I would rather be invested in a rich company than in a company that gives away its money and promises to work ever harder and raise prices on customers ad infinitum.” He added: “You can cling to twentieth-century capital—treasury bills, stock buybacks, dividends—or you can embrace the future, capitalize on Bitcoin, and turn a decapitalization spiral into progressive growth. It’s good for your customers, your employees, your shareholders, your country, and your legacy. Adopt Bitcoin.” The shorthand $75 billion bet circulating in conference corridors reflects Microsoft’s authorized buyback and two years of forward dividends folded into a single digital-asset allocation. Notably, Microsoft shareholders voted against a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet during the firm’s meeting on December 10. At press time, BTC traded at $96,521.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Michael Snyder | May 7, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now, expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that, shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course, anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone who cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs anytime soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI GUANGZHOU, CHINA - APRIL 30: Passengers have their body temperature measured before taking a WeRide ... More L4 autonomous driving bus on April 30, 2022 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China. Passengers can experience the driverless bus line in Guangzhou, which opens for a test ride from Saturday. (Photo by Chen Jimin/China News Service via Getty Images) Updated, May 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include information from Uber's Q1 2025 earnings report. Shares in WeRide, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology provider, popped 40% Tuesday, according to Google Finance. Why? The $2.6 billion market capitalization company is partnering with Uber — which is adding $100 million to its investment in WeRide — to expand its robotaxi services from Abu Dhabi to 15 more cities worldwide by 2030, according to CnEV Post. Should investors buy WeRide stock? Although the company’s revenue fell in 2024 and its losses are huge, Uber’s vote of confidence in WeRide could contribute to significant growth and ultimate profitability. WeRide — which operates a driverless commercial Robotaxi service in Beijing and does business in 10 countries — suffered a decline in revenue and a substantial loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call transcript. More specifically, in the fourth quarter WeRide’s revenue fell 3% to $15.8 million coupled with a 112% increase in the company’s net loss to $34 million, noted the earnings call transcript. WeRide has the potential to grow rapidly — with positive contribution margins — aided by local partnerships. Outside China, the company provides “autonomous vehicles and services to local partners and global platforms through a combination of selling the vehicles, charging a fixed service fee, and a revenue-sharing arrangement,” WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li told investors in the earnings call. To be sure, WeRide faces challenges when it introduces autonomous vehicles in a new location. To overcome those challenges, WeRide builds up mutual trust — gradually introducing “automobile driving products, like we can always introduce RoboSweeper at first, and also fixed-route minibus, which the challenges for safety for this product relatively low compared to the requirements for Robotaxi,” WeRide CEO Tony Han told investors, according to the earnings call. This trust has scaled sufficiently for Uber to expand its partnership with WeRide. By 2030, Uber — which already operates a robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, with Dubai next in line — will roll out WeRide’s Robotaxi services in “15 new cities across Europe and other regions outside of China and the U.S.,” noted TipRanks. The Uber-WeRide partnership splits up the work of operating robotaxis between the two companies based on their mutual strengths. WeRide provides the self-driving technology, while Uber integrates the service into its app and manages fleet operations, TipRanks reported. WeRide offers another advantages to Uber’s efforts to expand autonomous services globally. That’s because WeRide’s presence in 30 cities across 10 countries includes “test licenses in China, UAE, Singapore, France, and the U.S.,” TipRanks reported, which will make it easier for Uber to overcome regulatory barriers to entry in key markets. Uber has other robotaxi partnerships with Waymo, Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora in the U.S. as well as international partnerships with Pony.AI and Momenta, reported CNBC. Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta. Based on analysts’ price targets, WeRide stock has more upside than Uber. Two analysts who cover WeRide set an average price target of $22, according to Zack’s — representing 133% upside. Meanwhile, Uber — which just reported first quarter 2025 results — has less upside. More specifically, the ride-booking giant’s stock has 5.6% upside based on the average price target of 33 analysts of $90.20, noted TipRanks. Uber’s stock fell 1.3% in May 7 trading after reporting a mixed result – in which the company’s revenue fell short of expectations while its earnings per share beat them. Specifically, Uber’s Q1 revenue of $11.53 billion fell $100 million short of London Stock Exchange Group expectations, according to CNBC, while Q1 earnings per share of 80 cents beat analysts’ views by 33 cents. The company’s Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as measured by the number completed trips per day, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC. With the global market for robotaxi services growing at an 80.8% average annual rate to $119 billion by 2031, according to Fortune Business Insights, WeRide stock may have further room to rise with help from the Uber partnership.

Title: What’s Happening With Arista Stock?

More mobile phone screen with the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Despite posting impressive quarterly results, Arista Networks (NASDAQ: ANET) saw an unexpected market reaction. The company delivered solid numbers with sales reaching $2.0 billion (up 27.6% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share (up from $0.50 last year). Both figures beat Wall Street expectations of $1.97 billion in sales and $0.59 EPS. As an aside, will Tesla get back to basics? See Tesla’s Lost Cause. Adding to the good news, Arista’s Q2 outlook of $2.1 billion exceeded consensus estimates, and they announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program. Normally, these would be ingredients for a stock rally, but instead, ANET dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Clearly, ANET stock is volatile, and if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What’s Next For HIMS Stock After A Solid Q1? So what happened? Investors were clearly hoping for even more, especially considering major tech companies have maintained their AI-related capital expenditure plans. The question now: Does it make sense to buy ANET at $86 (after-hours price)? We think absolutely. At $86 (after market), ANET trades at 15x trailing revenues, just slightly above its three-year average P/S ratio of 14x. We believe a higher valuation multiple is justified given Arista’s strong position in the AI space, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google making up a significant portion of sales while remaining committed to AI expansion. With sales growth projected in the high teens over the next few years, the premium valuation makes sense. Bottom line: Investors should consider using this dip in ANET stock as an opportunity to buy for solid long-term gains. For investors aiming to reduce the inherent volatility associated with individual stocks like Arista Networks, there are alternative investment strategies available. The Trefis RV strategy, which has a history of outperforming its all-cap stock benchmark, provides a diversified approach to potentially achieve solid returns. Likewise, the High-Quality portfolio has shown superior performance compared to the S&P 500 with returns that exceed 91% since its initiation, offering potential upside with reduced stock-specific risk.

Today is the start of the REAL ID requirement at airport security checkpoints, but if you don’t have one, don’t panic. Most people will still be allowed to fly, according to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A standard, state-issued driver’s license is no longer enough to get through security—you’ll need one that typically has a star in the upper right corner, though each state’s version looks different. And while you may get through security without a REAL ID, it could mean going through extra screening, so plan to arrive three hours ahead of your flight. The requirement, aimed at improving security, has been long-delayed. But if you have a passport or one of roughly a dozen other compliant forms of identification, there’s no need to rush on obtaining a REAL ID. An army soldier stands guard on the rooftop of a mosque building damaged by a suspected Indian ... More missile attack near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan controlled Kashmir. (AP Photo/M.D. Mughal) India launched missile strikes in Pakistan Wednesday, two weeks after it accused Pakistan of being involved in a terrorist attack on the tourist town of Pahalgam that killed over two dozen people. Pakistani officials denounced the strikes, calling them “an unprovoked and blatant act of war.” The nuclear-armed nations have been at odds for decades, but tensions have risen in recent weeks following the Pahalgam attack. Even as AI models become more advanced, they’re increasingly prone to hallucinations, or false information created by false reasoning, presenting a challenge for the industry. For instance, company tests show OpenAI’s newest o3 and o4-mini models have hallucinated 30-50% of the time, and it’s unclear why. U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell Despite demands from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates as the central bank’s rate-setting committee meets this week. Economists at the three largest investment banks all predict the Fed will keep rates steady as it grapples with inflation that remains above its 2% target. Legal AI startup Legora is in talks to raise $85 million in funding at a $675 million valuation, following a string of deals with big name law firms. The firm’s software helps lawyers draft contracts, review and analyze documents, and run checks against legal databases, automating some of the most repetitive and tedious tasks for attorneys. Amazon-owned robotaxi firm Zoox has issued a software recall for 270 of its vehicles after an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle in Las Vegas last month. The incident didn’t result in any injuries, and the robotaxis are back on the road, but it adds to a series of challenges for the fledgling industry. The Trump Organization disclosed in a filing submitted to British regulators that President Donald Trump retains influence over the trust that controls one of his U.K. golf resorts and, via a web of additional entities, virtually every other asset in his empire. By stating that Trump has control over the trust, his own business appears to admit that Trump maintains a grip on his business empire, despite some efforts to portray separation. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump Administration’s transgender military ban to take effect again while a legal case against it moves forward. A lower court had paused the policy, but it is now in effect until it potentially comes back to the highest court again. an airport control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport Newly released audio reveals that air traffic controllers temporarily lost all contact with planes approaching Newark Airport on April 28. Following the incident, some air traffic controllers took time off, and a shortage of controllers has caused hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at the airport over the past week. In recent days, President Donald Trump and top advisor Stephen Miller have suggested immigrants may not be entitled to due process before being deported, as the Trump Administration faces pushback over its mass deportation plans. But that conflicts with longstanding legal precedent: In 1993, conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that “the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.” For a variety of reasons, elite college admissions are becoming an impossible dream—even for perfect students. Today, 19 of 20 applications submitted to nearly all of the schools in the Ivy League are rejected. And it’s not just the super elite: Admission rates are plunging at popular schools like Northeastern University and New York University. Lower admissions rates lead to more stress and more heartbreak. But while the traditional May 1 decision deadline has come and gone, it’s not too late to secure a college acceptance for the fall term. Through April and May, hundreds of colleges report to the National Association for College Admission Counselors that they still have seats available in their incoming freshman classes. As of Wednesday, 281 colleges told NACAC they’re still seeking applicants. Many of these colleges are excellent, and in an effort to highlight the best colleges in need of freshmen, Forbes has culled the list for schools that appear on the 2025 Forbes Top Colleges list, as well as the Princeton Review’s 2025 list of Best Colleges. One option is the University of San Francisco, a private Jesuit university that is popular for health professions programs. And if internships are a goal, Philadelphia’s Drexel University, with 12,000 undergraduates and 100 majors and minors, is known for its co-op program, which places students in paying jobs for six-month stints at employers like Comcast, Dupont, Estee Lauder, Vanguard and Johnson & Johnson. WHY IT MATTERS “Heading into high school graduation season without a college admission offer is disheartening, no doubt, but it’s not time to give up on college ambitions,” says Forbes staff writer Emma Whitford. “Students who didn’t get any college acceptances still have plenty of excellent schools to apply to for the fall, and a strong transfer application to your dream school next spring will fare better than a first-year application following a gap year.” MORE America’s Top Colleges If trade negotiations fall through, the European Union could consider placing additional tariffs on more than $110 billion in U.S. exports. That would impact everything from cars to oil and gas: $10 billion: The worth of new cars exported from the U.S. to the EU in 2023 3.5%: The share of all U.S. global exports that went to Germany in 2022 Nearly 1 million: The number of jobs in the U.S. supported by trade in services with the EU in 2023 With layoffs in the news, it’s natural to worry that your position could be on the chopping block. In a recent survey, HR directors and managers identified five red flags that could signal a role could be eliminated, including whether a position can be replaced by AI, or if the role relies on outdated skillsets. Consider making a career pivot that leverages your skills if your position is at risk of automation, and make sure to regularly assess your performance with your boss.

Title: When The CEO Is The Corporate Brand: How To Manage Reputational Risks

ByBrian Cattell ByBrian Cattell, Forbes Councils Member. Brian Cattell, Managing Partner at CLP Strategies, a strategic communications firm with offices in New York City and London. It’s not new for charismatic CEOs to be the face of the corporations they lead. In 2025, however, with many business leaders seeming to be either permanently on social media, on TV or quoted in the newspapers, many CEOs have effectively become the company brand. It’s not just the extreme examples like Elon Musk. More sober but still ubiquitous corporate titans such as Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jensen Huang of Nvidia or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Today’s rapidly evolving ecosystem of new digital, social and legacy media platforms means that these executives are in the spotlight more than any others in corporate history. In many ways, today’s CEOs are behaving more like influencers. They comment on market trends, share views on AI and even weigh in on how everyday people spend their free time. Every post or statement is instantly shared, analyzed and judged. As a result, corporate communications teams must now manage not only the company’s brand but also a highly visible, human brand—one that’s imperfect, spontaneous and constantly speaking. Consider WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick’s infamous "let them eat cake" moment in 2024. In a CNBC interview, Pilnick suggested cereal as a low-cost dinner option amid rising food prices—claiming it could feed a family for just $1. The backlash was swift. His comments went viral, drawing sharp criticism online from people who saw the remarks as tone-deaf and out of touch. Although Pilnick—new to the role at the time—kept his job and WK Kellogg avoided lasting damage, it’s safe to assume his communications team likely spent several intense days managing the fallout. How can a company let a CEO be themselves and convey authenticity without a script while safely representing the corporate brand without undue reputational risk? There’s no doubt that authenticity has value—genuine, unfiltered communication can build trust with both internal and external audiences. Live videos, spontaneous interviews and off-the-cuff Q&As often resonate more than polished scripts. But these moments also carry serious risks. A casual, poorly worded remark can easily veer off-message, triggering internal frustration among employees or, worse, sparking public backlash. Anything from political opinion to comments about layoffs, the workforce and much more are at risk of being misinterpreted. So, how should the internal communications team or external advisers to the corporation manage these new risks? First, media training needs to go beyond traditional TV or print media. It now needs to cover the right tone and body language for TikTok or Instagram, LinkedIn etiquette and dealing with live comments from customers or employees in an open forum environment. Before CEOs go out into the world to communicate, there needs to be some deep thinking about content strategy. It needs to balance personal branding for the individual with corporate messaging. Don’t forget to plan for different scenarios. Comms teams, particularly those supporting high-profile business leaders, should have a multistep plan that follows the possibility of their CEO’s comment or post going viral for the wrong reason. Finally, PRs have been practicing the art of rapid rebuttal in the media for decades. In today’s environment, speed for response across all content verticals is just as critical. Prepare well and be ready to step in should things go south. The great paradox of the modern CEO as the corporate brand is that it stems from a desire to be relatable to many more people than were traditionally reached by the words and actions of company executives. However, by striving to be relatable through greater public exposure, business leaders increase their risk of doing or saying the wrong thing. If that happens, they end up being anything but the person that someone would love to have a beer with. While high-profile gaffes often dominate headlines, a CEO’s internal reputation can be just as critical. When the CEO embodies the company’s identity, their mistakes don’t just damage the brand externally—they can also shake confidence within the organization. Misjudged statements—especially during sensitive moments like layoffs or changes to DEI or remote work policies—can spark anything from employee backlash to public criticism. As a result, communications teams must now monitor internal sentiment as closely as they do media, customer and investor reactions. The challenge for those managing a CEO brand in 2025 is to balance risk and reward. The leader’s voice can be a very powerful tool, but it requires careful management, strategy and real-time monitoring. In an age where saying the wrong thing can spark a consumer boycott or an employee walkout, the CEO doesn’t just speak for the company—they often are the company. Forbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify?

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File photo Uber Technologies missed quarterly revenue estimates as growth in its ride-hailing unit slowed to its weakest since the pandemic, stirring fears of slowing demand against the backdrop of a murky economic outlook and clouding an upbeat forecast. Shares of the company fell about 8 per cent before clawing back some ground to be down 5 per cent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Total revenue rose 14 per cent to $11.53 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $11.62 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Uber has struggled to match the high growth from the post-pandemic quarters and is also contending with lower ride prices with some customers seeking cheaper transport options.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money

Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money

It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut.

Title: Grant Cardone Says, 'America About To Have Greatest Resurgence In Its 250-Year History,' Thanks Trump For Encouraging Big Tech To Come Home

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Entrepreneur Grant Cardone is celebrating what he calls the beginning of America’s biggest comeback ever, thanks to President Donald Trump’s push to bring tech manufacturing back to the U.S. Cardone posted on X after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a massive new chip investment. “America is about to have its greatest resurgence in its 250 year history. Thank you President Trump for ‘encouraging' big tech to come home,” Cardone wrote, sharing a video of Huang’s remarks. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. During the event, Trump introduced Huang as “the founder, CEO and president of NVIDIA,” and said he was producing up to $500 billion worth of the most powerful AI chips over the next four years—all to be manufactured in the U.S. for the first time ever. Huang said, “NVIDIA reinvented computing for the first time after 60 years,” noting that modern computer design hasn’t changed much since IBM’s System/360 in the 1960s. But the new AI chips are a big leap forward. “That GPU—that’s one GPU unit—it’s 70 pounds, 60,000 parts, 10,000 watts,” Huang said. “Just to test a superchip requires a supercomputer.” Trending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share. Huang credited Trump for pushing manufacturing to happen in the U.S. “Without the president’s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly, his strong encouragement … manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace,” he said. He emphasized that making these chips isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about advanced tech, robotics, and AI. Nvidia will also use its Omniverse digital twin technology to help build cutting-edge factories on U.S. soil. “This new industry is a manufacturing industry in itself,” Huang said. “We now have the backing of the administration, the backing of President Trump, to support the creation of a whole new industry.” See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Huang said the AI infrastructure being built in the U.S. will power breakthroughs in healthcare, financial services, drug discovery, education, and more. “This computer is the engine of a whole new industry,” he said. “Electricity goes into this machine and incredible tokens come out—artificial intelligence.” Nvidia’s partnership with the Trump administration may be shaping up to be a key turning point in bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S., and Cardone believes it could mark the beginning of a historic economic transformation.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on concerns over trade tensions

Wednesday, 07 May 2025 NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a wave of corporate earnings while looking ahead to developments on trade talks and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 389.83 points, or 0.95 percent, to 40,829.00. The S&P 500 dropped 43.47 points, or 0.77 percent, to 5,606.91, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 154.58 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 17,689.66. Nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory, led by healthcare and consumer discretionary, which declined 2.76 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. Utilities and energy were the only sectors to post gains, up 1.23 percent and 0.10 percent. Stocks seesawed on Tuesday following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, their first formal negotiation session since Carney recently took office. During the meeting, Trump dialed back earlier optimism about impending trade agreements, stating bluntly, "We don't have to sign deals." The remark marked a sharp reversal from his Sunday comments, when he suggested multiple deals could be finalized as soon as this week. Investors are now turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which is not expected to change its benchmark interest rate this week. However, markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday, particularly his views on how the Trump administration's tariff policies may be influencing the broader economic outlook. "Despite external pressure to lower rates, the Fed will likely hold strong on the current pause until we see greater clarity on the major economic factors impacting the economy," said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. "As the impacts of tariffs settle in, we still broadly expect the economy to continue to shift towards a slower pace of growth than in recent months." Earnings reports drove notable stock movements on Tuesday. Palantir plunged 12.05 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, despite meeting first-quarter earnings expectations and providing a positive forecast. In contrast, Constellation Energy surged 10.29 percent after beating revenue estimates, fueled by rising electricity demand linked to AI infrastructure growth. Ford Motor gained 2.65 percent after surpassing quarterly profit estimates, though it withdrew its full-year guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty. Mattel also climbed 2.78 percent as it suspended its outlook and announced price hikes in response to tariffs. Large-cap tech stocks, which had recently driven much of the market's rally, faced selling pressure. Tesla and Meta Platforms both declined by about 2 percent, while Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Broadcom, Apple and Nvidia also lost ground. Thank you for your report!

Title: Supermicro Stock Drops as Server Maker Lowers Its Revenue Outlook

Time Published: 2025-05-06T22:41:03Z

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cut its full-year revenue outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Tuesday. The server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion, down from its prior range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. Supermicro shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the release. For the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted revenue of $4.6 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year and at the high end of its significantly reduced forecast. Adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share fell from 66 cents per share a year earlier. Supermicro said it anticipates fourth-quarter sales of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents to 50 cents. CEO Charles Liang said some Supermicro clients delayed making product decisions during the period, which pushed sales beyond the fiscal third quarter. “We do expect many of those commitments to land in the June and September quarters, reinforcing my confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets, however economic uncertainty and tariff impacts may have a short-term impact,” Liang said. Supermicro shares have seen significant volatility this year as concerns about the company's accounting practices and delayed filings raised worries it could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The company ultimately met the exchange’s deadline to file its delayed reports in February, but still faces challenges, including uncertainty around how it could be affected by shifting tariff policies.

Title: The 7 Best Diaper Bags, According To Moms Who’ve Tested Over 20 Styles

Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:52:55Z

Before I had my first baby, I don’t think I truly understood how many things I would need to carry around with them whenever we left the house. The best diaper bags have the space to stow all those baby essentials like wipes, diapers, bottles, spare clothes, burp cloths and toys. They’re also comfortable and easy for parents to use, so you’re not digging through the diaper bag abyss to find that elusive pacifier. After testing over 20 diaper bags among several testers, we found the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack to be the best—it’s made of high-quality materials and has dedicated pockets for all the essentials. Our top value pick, the popular Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack, is lightweight, roomy and has remained durable through years of testing. The best diaper bags hold and organize everything you need for your little. Here are all of our winners after testing over 20 diaper bags: When choosing a diaper bag, consider the size and style you want. If you have multiple kids, you may need a larger bag—but be careful not to overload it. Additionally, many parents prefer a backpack or belt bag, so they can have their hands free. “A comfortable, well-designed and ergonomic diaper bag that meets your specific needs can improve quality of life as you navigate the daily demands of motherhood,” says Amy McCormick, an occupational therapist who leads the postpartum rehabilitation program at UNC Rex Holly Springs Hospital in North Carolina. Continue reading for an in-depth look at all of our top picks for the best diaper bags along with more information on our testing process and what to look for when you’re shopping for a diaper bag. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 13.4 x 6.7 x 13.8 inches | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: A 100% guarantee on hardware and fabric defects for two years | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: With 10 total pockets, the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack makes it simple to find a spot for all your baby items and then some. From a discreet felt-lined electronics pocket to stretchy diaper pockets and an insulated bottle pocket, there’s a place to put everything. The large main compartment zippers all the way down, which helps with packing the bag and finding things that may have fallen to the bottom. A strap on the back that attaches to rolling luggage makes it a great option for travel, too. It’s also the lightest diaper bag backpack that we tested. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack is just the right size for essentials. Many of the more stylish diaper bags I’ve tested are either uncomfortable or have fabrics that are difficult to maintain and clean. That isn’t the case with this bag. Depending on the style you choose, the outer material is either vegan leather, coated canvas or vegan leather with cable-stitch textured embossing. The styles are classic and professional, making this a good option to bring to work if you’re pumping or simply want to continue to use the bag after your baby is older. Though the bag isn’t machine washable, the materials are easy to wipe clean. Our tester intentionally spilled a blueberry pouch on the bag and left it to sit overnight. In the morning, it wiped up effortlessly. The included changing pad is machine washable, so there’s no need to worry about messy diaper changes. The comfort of this bag is a huge plus, too. It’s a backpack-style bag, which many of our experts recommend. The padded straps are nice and comfortable. “When worn properly, with both straps well positioned, [backpack bags] can help minimize risk of injury and reduce stress on the back, abdominals, and pelvic floor,” says McCormick., Though I laud the bag for its ample pockets, you can’t pack quite as much in this bag as some of our other top picks, like the Skip Hop Forma or the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag. When I try to put too many things in the bag, it becomes lumpy and awkward because there isn’t much give to the material. Our tester also found that the side water bottle pocket was difficult to pack when there were too many things in the main compartment. However, that limit on space is a good thing in some ways. “More space just means more stuff crammed inside—and trust us, you don’t need to carry everything but the kitchen sink,” says Laura Hunter, a licensed practical nurse and cofounder of Moms on Call, a parenting resource brand. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 14 inches | Weight: 1.4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited warranty | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: The value of the Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack is unmatched. My husband and I have used it as our main diaper bag for over five years, and it’s still in excellent shape. The bag has two padded straps and it’s a backpack bag, making it the ideal ergonomic option. Because it’s a backpack bag that’s incredibly lightweight, this is a good option for parents have back problems or moms who may struggle with core strength, pelvic floor strength or who are recovering from a c-section or tear. “Postpartum moms should consider their core and pelvic health when choosing a diaper bag. After a vaginal birth, weakened pelvic floor muscles and potential back pain mean a lightweight, evenly distributed bag (like a backpack style) is ideal to reduce strain. For c-section recovery, avoiding heavy shoulder bags that put pressure on healing abdominal muscles is crucial,” says John Gallucci Jr., a doctor of physical therapy and CEO of New York-based Jag Physical Therapy. The Skip Hop Forma is a great value option that's durable and easy to pack. I like packing this bag more than some of the more stylish or boxy bags because the material has some give to it. There are nine total pockets, plus two packing cubes. Pockets include two bottle pockets, a main compartment, two stretchy interior pockets, two front zipper pockets and more. The bag also comes with a changing pad. The side bottle pockets have plenty of room to hold water bottles for parents and caregivers or babies. The storage cubes are great for packing things on-the-go, too. If I want to leave the larger diaper bag in the car, I can put a bottle, diaper and some wipes in a packing cube and significantly lighten my load. McCormick likes the option of using removable storage cubes, too, as they make it easy to add and remove items based on the specific outing or activity. The fabric is water-repellent, and our tester found it easy to clean a spilled baby food pouch and water. In addition to being able to wipe down any spills, I’ve also found that it’s easy to clean out crumbs and messes at the bottom of the bag because the fabric has enough flexibility to it that I can turn the bag inside out. Dagne Dover Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 9.5 x 5.6 x 12.3 inches (small), 11.8 x 6.5 x 12.8 inches (medium, 12.3 x 7 x 13.8 (large) | Weight: 3 pounds (small), 3.5 pounds (medium), 4 pounds (large)| Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited guarantee for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Hand wash Best for: Skip if: The Dagne Dover Indi Diaper Backpack comes in small, medium and large sizes, so parents can find the right option for their carrying style. In addition to the many interior and exterior pockets, including a wipes and insulated bottle holder, it also comes with extras like a storage pouch and a shoe bag. A luggage sleeve on the back makes this a good option for travel, too. Other extras include a changing mat and stroller clips, though we don’t recommend using stroller clips due to the potential danger of tipping the stroller. If you tend to overpack your bag, you might want to get the size larger than you think you’ll need. Our tester found that when she had the main compartment of the bag packed full, it was difficult to use the exterior zipper pockets. The fabric on the Dagne Dover Indi is so comfortable and soft. Many people love the look and feel of the Indi. The neoprene material is 100% vegan, and it’s available in a variety of aesthetic colors, some of which are gender-neutral. From the outside, it looks more like a regular backpack than a diaper bag. The fabric is soft, not stiff, and the nicely padded straps make it comfortable to wear. Our tester found that the fabric stretches easily to accommodate items that you throw in the bag. If you (or your kids) tend to spill things a lot, this may not be the best bag for you. When our tester spilled water and a tot food pouch on the bag, it initially cleaned up well, but in the long-term, she found some stains lingered on her camel-colored bag. Béis Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12 x 7.75 x 15 inches | Weight: 4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 45-day return policy | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: Some people like to overstuff their diaper bag (guilty as charged). Whether you’re packing for twins like me or just need extra space, the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag gives you the room you need. The top of the bag opens wide so you can pack and find the things you need, and there are a good number of pockets. Our tester found that the exterior bottle pockets were large enough to hold her water bottles, which wasn’t the case with every bag she tested. Inside, you can tighten the insulated bottle pouch so your baby’s bottle doesn’t get lost in the main compartment. Because it’s such a big bag and it already weighs 4 pounds, be careful not to overpack it. “Extremely large or heavy bags may encourage overpacking, making it hard to reach items and adding unnecessary strain to the back, abdominals and pelvic floor,” says McCormick. Though the bag can get heavy if you stuff too much in it, our tester found it comfortable with nicely padded straps. My favorite thing about the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag is that it’s obvious it was thoroughly designed with babies and parents in mind. The included changing pad has a pouch to store diapers, wipes or diaper rash cream. In the bag, you’ll find a pacifier pouch and a teething ring. There is also an odor-proof pouch, which is ideal for storing soiled clothes or for parents who use cloth diapers to store dirty diapers until they get home. Another included extra is stroller clips, though we do not recommend using these as the weight of the bag can tip your stroller. Our tester loved all of these extras as well as how easy the bag is to clean. The stain-resistant fabric can be wiped down. She had no problem cleaning up the food pouch that she intentionally spilled on the bag. The high-quality and easy-to-clean material makes this a great pick for families with multiple kids or those who want a durable bag that can stand up to extensive everyday use. Caraa Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12.3 x 12 x 5 inches (medium), 13 x 12.8 x 5.8 (large) | Weight: 2.5 pounds (medium), 3 pounds (large) | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 21 day return period, manufacturing defects are assessed on a case by case basis | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable (black), clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth (all other colors) Best for: Skip if: Becoming a parent doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your style or your love for luxury products. The Caraa Baby Bag is made with parent and baby in mind, with so many thoughtful features. Forbes Vetted editor Margaret Badore found that this bag had the best features of all the high-end bags she tested. She particularly likes the hot/cold pocket and the fully removable diaper caddy. The caddy has four pockets for storing wipes, diapers and other essentials, and it’s a helpful feature for packing a few things on the go. “The removable organizer is also extremely useful; when packed with diaper change essentials, I could take just that part out and head to the bathroom with baby for a change,” says Badore. Unfortunately, the bag does not come with a changing pad to complement the diaper caddy. One of my favorite baby-friendly features: the black version of the bag is machine washable, which isn’t a common feature in diaper bags. No matter the spill, you can throw it in the wash for quick cleanup. For other color options, you need to clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth to maintain the color. The Caraa Baby Bag can be worn as a backpack or a cross-body bag. The bag is available in a medium or large size, and the versatility is key. You can choose to wear the bag as a backpack or as a crossbody bag by attaching a shoulder strap. When you wear it this way, you can tuck the backpack straps out of the way. The bag also comes with stroller hooks, but we don’t recommend using them because hanging a bag on your stroller can cause it to tip. This bag has so many pockets. From insulated bottle pockets to a phone pocket to hot/cold pockets and pockets with magnetic closures, you’ll certainly find a spot to put everything. When you’re traveling, simply slide the bag onto your luggage with the attached luggage sleeve. Badore has used this bag for about two years, including on family trips and as a carry-on, and has found virtually no signs of wear. The profile of this bag is a bit wider than many others, so that’s something to consider if you need your bag to fit into a compact area. State Bags Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16.5 x 13 x 5.9 inches | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 1 year for material or manufacturing defects | Cleaning instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth Best for: Skip if: A gender neutral diaper bag is ideal if you’ll be sharing the bag with other caregivers—or perhaps you simply prefer that look and style. From the outside, the State Lorimer Diaper Bag doesn’t scream diaper bag, and it’s available in five colors, including the several gender-neutral picks like an olive, black and navy. You can personalize the bag with up to three characters and two symbols or patches. The padded straps are nice, and Badore found the bag comfortable even when it was loaded up. When traveling, you can also attach the bag to your luggage with a built-in luggage slip. The fabric is easy to clean. In our tests, water ran right off the nylon parts, and our spilled pouch wiped up no problem. Badore appreciates all of the pockets in this bag, which include two main compartments, a front zipper pocket, side water bottle pockets, an insulated bottle pocket and more. With so many places to put things, it’s less likely you’ll lose something at the bottom of the bag. It also includes a washable changing pad and a padded laptop sleeve that fits laptops up to 15 inches. For parents who sometimes have to work while taking care of their kids, this can be a huge plus. Though there is plenty of room for all of the essentials, the large size of this bag could encourage you to pack too much, which could put extra stain on your back. This can also be dangerous if you use the attached stroller clips as a heavy diaper bag could tip a stroller. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 6.5 x 7 x 4 inches | Weight: 2 pounds | Bag style: Belt bag | Warranty: Limited warranty for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable Best for: Skip if: I really couldn’t ask for much more in a compact diaper bag. The Colugo On-The-Go Organizer is sleek, comfortable and highly adjustable. According to Hunter, small and compact is the way to go. “Moms on Call recommends smaller, well-organized bags that keep only the essentials at your fingertips. Some other features we can do without,” she says. The bag has enough room for the basics like diapers and wipes. It has six pockets plus two bottle holders, so you can keep your items organized, too. Our tester was surprised at how many things she could fit in the bag. It also had room for her son’s sweatshirt. The Colugo On The Go Organizer is ideal for staying hands-free while carrying all the essentials. My favorite thing about this bag is that it can double as a stroller organizer. While hanging larger, heavier bags from a stroller is unsafe due to the potential for tipping, I don’t worry about that with such a small bag. In fact, the bag is designed to be a stroller organizer first, diaper bag second. It’s nice to be able to just grab the bag and go when you need to park your stroller or leave it somewhere unattended. The versatility makes the price just right, too. You’re getting two products in one. I appreciate machine-washable diaper bags like this one, because with three kids, sometimes I don’t realize a spill happened until well after the fact. It wipes down easily, too. Our tester spilled the majority of a water bottle in the bag and found that it dried easily and didn’t get things stored in other pockets wet. The bag is simple to adjust and comfortable. I don’t have to fiddle with the straps too much to get them where I want them. Other crossbody or belt bags that I’ve tested feel too boxy or bulky, but I didn’t find that with this one. The strap also has a pretty wide range, meaning it can work for caregivers of various sizes. Over several years, we’ve tested more than 20 diaper bags among three mom testers. We included our favorites in the guide and continue to test additional bags as they become available. Here are the others we’ve tested: Freshly Picked Classic Diaper Bag: I’ve had this bag for years, and I really like the style and look of it. However, it’s pretty boxy, and it doesn’t offer as many organization options as other bags. Another tester also found that it started to fray almost immediately, which made us question the high price tag. BabbleRoo Diaper Bag Backpack: This is a budget-friendly diaper bag that is available in many colors and styles. It also has a lot of useful pockets, like a pacifier pouch and three insulated bottle pockets. It wasn’t as comfortable as some of the other bags we tested, and our tester found it difficult to pack the bag with everything she needed. Ruvalino Diaper Bag Backpack: This popular bag is well-loved for its low price. However, it’s somewhat bulky and stiff. It was also a bit more difficult to clean than many other bags we tested. We enjoyed the variety of pockets and were able to pack a lot into the bag. Herschel Baby Strand Sprout Shoulder Bag: Though this is more of a minimalistic bag, there is plenty of space inside. Our tester really liked the included changing pad. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the features of our top picks and our tester wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to carry the bag. Eddie Bauer Cascade Back Pack Diaper Bag: There are plenty of features packed into this diaper bag like a wipes pocket, insulated bottle pocket and changing pad. However, it’s not as user-friendly as we’d like. It can be difficult to reach the bottom of the main compartment and our tester found that the diaper pockets weren’t wide enough. Béis The Diaper Pack: This bag has some nice features like a changing pad and a convenient wipes pocket. It’s also pretty spacious for a belt bag. However, I found it too boxy and bulky. The main dealbreaker was that when worn as a belt bag, I couldn’t get the straps small enough. Parents and caregivers with slim frames may struggle to get the bag tight enough to stay on. Dagne Dover Ace: Those searching for something extra minimalistic might like this fanny pack diaper bag—but it just didn’t have enough features or space for us. Storq Quick Change Fanny Pack : Though this bag is a good size for a belt bag, it doesn’t have the organization features necessary to store the amount of baby gear you can fit in a bag. We like that it’s lightweight and machine washable. Ditty Co. Small Diaper Bag: This belt bag is comfortable and machine washable with an affordable price that matches it size. It might work for some families who prefer to pack light, but we wanted more space. Luli Baby Monaco Sling Bag: This sling bag has nice features given its smaller package, such as a pacifier holder and a phone pocket. It’s more complicated to adjust and get items out of than other bags we tested, though, and when you’re juggling babies and all their things, you don’t want a bag that makes things more difficult. State Jordan Diaper Bag: We were able to fit plenty of things in this bag and liked the organizing pouches and changing pad. However, we didn’t find the shoulder strap very comfortable, especially when compared to backpack style diaper bags. BagSmart Walker 25L Featherlight Travel Diaper Backpack: There are a lot of features in this bag that we appreciated, like the large insulated bottle pocket and the waterproof laundry pouch. What our tester didn’t like was that many of these features don’t quite work the way they should. For example, the insulated bottle pouch didn’t fit many popular bottle brands, and it was hard to get diapers to fit into the diaper pouches. JuJuBe B.F.F. Diaper Bag: You can wear this bag as a backpack, messenger bag or shoulder bag—but our tester didn’t find it comfortable to wear, and it wasn’t quite big enough to fit all of our supplies. We also tested the Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag and the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag is no longer in stock, and though the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag was our previous pick for the best diaper belt bag, the bag has since been discontinued. What we’re testing next: We’re continuing to test two No Reception bags, two Calpak diaper bags, including the Calpak Diaper Backpack With Laptop Sleeve, and plan to consider the new Away diaper bag collection as well as Uppababy’s Changing Backpack, among others. We’ve spent years testing diaper bags and between myself and two other testers, we’ve tested over 20 bags. For this round of testing in 2025, myself and baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore tested a combined 11 bags, and some bags have been tested by multiple families. We tested the diaper bags in real-world situations, like daycare drop-offs, family outings and trips to the pediatrician’s office. Here’s a peek at what we looked for when we tested bags: The best diaper bags make it easier for you to get out and about with your kids. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for a diaper bag. The three most common types of diaper bags are backpack, fanny pack or belt bags and shoulder or tote bags. Many parents and caregivers want a diaper bag that fits their style as it can become an extension of themselves for quite a few years. Don’t forget to consider the preferences of your partner or other caregivers, too. While you might love a stylish floral print bag, another caregiver you’ll be sharing the bag with might not. Ergonomics are incredibly important, particularly for new moms. After delivery, moms might face weakened abdominal muscles and a weakened pelvic floor. They might also be recovering from a c-section or a perineal tear. For any parent or caregiver, an ergonomic diaper bag can help reduce the risk of developing back, neck and shoulder pain. Some ergonomic features to look for include wide, padded backpack straps that allow you to evenly distribute weight, structured bags that maintain their shape while wearing them and adjustable straps. Choosing a lightweight bag and limiting how much you pack can be beneficial, too. “It’s important that all moms choose a diaper bag that is lightweight and adjustable to safely distribute weight and support healing of the pelvic floor and abdominals that are often compromised from the strain endured during both pregnancy and childbirth,” says McCormick. “Moms experiencing postural changes or diastasis recti should prioritize ergonomic designs that prevent excessive forward hunching,” adds Gallucci. “Ultimately, a well-balanced, adjustable bag can help reduce discomfort and support postpartum recovery.” Diaper bags can have many features. Some helpful ones include insulated pockets, changing pads, diaper pockets, wipe pockets, device pockets, storage cubes or pouches and clips for keys and toys. “Durable and easy-to-clean materials can hold up to everyday use, make messes quick to resolve with less stress, and prevent caregiver fatigue by allowing the bag to be set down without concern for damage,” says McCormick. While some bags are machine washable, most are water-resistant and can be wiped clean. I’m a parenting writer, product tester and mom to three, and I cover baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted. I’ve been testing baby, kids and parenting products for seven years, and I’ve tested many diaper bags on this list, some of which I’ve used for years. I test a wide range of products, from the best toys for 6-month-olds to the best strollers. In addition to testing products for this article, I also spoke to other parents and testers about which diaper bags they liked, conducted in-depth research, compared features of the diaper bags and interviewed four experts. Those experts include: At its core, a diaper bag is simply a place to carry baby essentials while you’re out and about. You can use a purse, backpack or any other type of bag as a diaper bag. However, many diaper bags have convenient features such as insulated bottle pockets, wipes pouches and elastic diaper storage pockets. They’re designed to carry all your baby essentials and often come with built-in changing pads, too. Prices of diaper bags can range from around $20 to over $200. Many durable and comfortable diaper bags fall in the $75 to $100 range. You might pay a bit more for something that’s more stylish or made of higher-end materials. When it comes to a diaper bag, the lighter, the better. As you add more things into the bag, it can get heavy, causing back and neck strain. Most diaper bags are 4 pounds or less with some belt bags weighing under a pound.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

LipoJaro Ingredients Breakdown Exploring the Natural Compounds That Power LipoJaro LipoJaro’s formula is built on a blend of natural ingredients selected to support the body’s fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and digestive balance—without the use of stimulants. This focus aligns with 2025’s clean-label movement and the shift toward non-GMO, plant-based supplements for weight management. Below is a closer look at each of the key ingredients in LipoJaro and how they may contribute to a more sustainable wellness routine. While individual results will vary, the inclusion of these compounds is grounded in a combination of traditional use and emerging scientific research. Disclaimer: The following ingredient descriptions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any supplement. Glucomannan Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. Once ingested, it expands in the stomach by absorbing water, which may create a sensation of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLA is a type of fatty acid found in meat and dairy products, though LipoJaro uses a plant-derived version. CLA has been studied for its potential to promote fat oxidation and preserve lean body mass. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract contains catechins—especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)—that are associated with fat-burning and antioxidant support. Garcinia Cambogia Derived from a tropical fruit, garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been explored for its potential role in suppressing appetite and reducing fat storage. Chromium Chromium is a trace mineral that may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Black Pepper Extract (BioPerine®) Black pepper extract is often added to enhance nutrient absorption. It improves bioavailability, making other ingredients in the formula more effective. Additional Botanicals and Synergistic Compounds While the primary ingredients carry most of the functional benefits, LipoJaro may also include supportive compounds such as: These additions are designed to round out the supplement and enhance its total impact over time. Designed for Ingredient Transparency LipoJaro’s formulation avoids artificial additives, preservatives, and synthetic fillers. Each capsule reflects the brand’s focus on quality, third-party testing, and manufacturing in GMP-certified facilities. Disclaimer: Effects are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the individual. Always verify ingredient labels for allergies or contraindications. No more jitters. Just results. Shop LipoJaro today and start your journey to better appetite control and metabolism—risk-free for 60 days! Reported Side Effects and Safety Considerations What to Know Before Starting LipoJaro While LipoJaro is marketed as a non-stimulant, natural weight management supplement, understanding its potential side effects and overall safety profile is important for informed use. Based on the formulation and user-reported feedback, most individuals tolerate the product well when taken as directed. That said, it's essential to explore how the body might initially respond to the active compounds, especially for first-time users or those with underlying health conditions. LipoJaro is formulated without common stimulants like caffeine or synephrine, which are often responsible for jitteriness, rapid heart rate, or sleep disturbances in traditional fat burners. Instead, it relies on a combination of fiber-rich and fat metabolism-supportive ingredients such as glucomannan, green tea extract, and CLA. These are generally considered gentle on the system, but they may cause mild digestive changes for some users during the adjustment period. Possible Mild Reactions Reported by Users Some individuals may experience: These effects are typically transient and tend to subside after the first few days of consistent use. Drinking adequate water when taking LipoJaro is essential for optimal fiber expansion and to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. Disclaimer: These potential side effects are not experienced by everyone. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking prescription medications. Who Should Avoid Taking LipoJaro? Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, there are cases where it may not be advisable. It may not be appropriate for individuals who: Because the supplement works partly by expanding in the stomach to help control appetite, it’simportant to take it with at least 8 oz of water. Taking it dry or without adequate hydration could result in discomfort or choking risk. A Clean-Label Alternative for Sensitive Users Compared to many over-the-counter weight loss products, LipoJaro offers a gentler approach—free of synthetic stimulants, harsh laxatives, or artificial colors and preservatives. This makes it appealing to those who have experienced side effects from stimulant-heavy formulas in the past or who prefer a cleaner supplement experience. As with any supplement, the best approach is to start slowly, listen to your body, and maintain open communication with a healthcare provider. LipoJaro's formula is designed for daily use, but it’s always smart to monitor how it fits into your personal health routine. Ready to ditch the crash diets?

Real User Results: What People Are Saying A Closer Look at the Lived Experience Behind the Label When evaluating a supplement like LipoJaro, it's not enough to simply review the ingredient list—real-world feedback from actual users offers some of the most valuable insight into what the product can or cannot do. Many people considering a non-stimulant fat burner want to know: Does LipoJaro actually work? What kinds of results can I expect? Are users satisfied with their outcomes? Across public reviews, feedback platforms, and testimonials shared on the official website, user impressions of LipoJaro show a mix of positive momentum and realistic expectations. While individual results vary, many users report benefits such as improved portion control, reduced cravings, more balanced energy levels, and modest but noticeable body composition changes when paired with healthy habits. Reported Positive Outcomes Common positive experiences include: For some individuals, the impact was not dramatic in the first few days, but became more noticeable with consistent use over two to three weeks. This gradual shift aligns with the supplement's intended purpose—supporting long-term metabolic and appetite regulation rather than forcing aggressive short-term weight loss. “After struggling with portion control for years, I finally feel like I’m in charge of my hunger instead of the other way around. LipoJaro made a big difference for me.” — Verified User Review “I wanted something without caffeine or jittery side effects. LipoJaro didn’t give me a quick fix, but it helped me stay consistent and avoid the late-night snacking that always ruined my progress.” — Verified Buyer Experience Realistic Expectations and Moderate Feedback While many users express satisfaction, some note that LipoJaro did not deliver drastic results on its own, especially without any dietary or exercise adjustments. A few reviewers mention needing to increase their water intake or adjust meal timing to better coordinate with the supplement. Others express the desire for quicker visual results, though they acknowledge the formula's stimulant-free nature and emphasis on sustainability over speed. Key Takeaways from User Feedback Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not guarantees of specific results. Supplement effects vary based on individual physiology, activity levels, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. By analyzing user responses, it becomes clear that LipoJaro is built more for reliability and balance than extreme fat loss. Those looking for a clean-label, stimulant-free addition to their routine may find it a helpful tool on the journey to better metabolic health. Your metabolism deserves better. LipoJaro supports sustainable fat loss—no harsh stimulants. Order today and save up to $780 instantly! Common Complaints and How They’re Handled Addressing the Concerns Behind the Feedback While many LipoJaro users report positive experiences, it’s important to acknowledge and evaluate the most common concerns shared by customers. A transparent supplement review doesn’t just highlight benefits—it also takes into account areas where users may have encountered friction or unmet expectations. Like any widely distributed wellness product, LipoJaro receives a range of feedback. Most complaints are not about the formulation itself but revolve around order fulfillment, expectations for rapid results, or communication with customer service. Understanding these concerns—and how the company addresses them—can help potential buyers make a more informed decision. Most Frequently Reported Complaints Disclaimer: Experiences vary by customer. For all support issues, it’s best to retain order confirmation emails and communicate directly with the official support team to ensure accurate service. How LipoJaro’s Brand Responds LipoJaro’s website features a clear returns policy and states a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. To back this, they provide a dedicated customer service email to handle refund requests, product inquiries, and shipping updates. While this policy is in place, like any supplement company, response times can fluctuate based on volume. The company also encourages buyers to use the product consistently for at least 30 days before judging its effectiveness—especially because it is not formulated with fast-acting synthetic stimulants that might mask true metabolic shifts. Transparent Business Practices Matter Although no product is universally loved, a brand’s willingness to address concerns head-on and stand by its refund policy reflects positively on its business model. Customers are encouraged to review all terms of service, usage instructions, and return guidelines before purchasing. Disclaimer: Always refer to the official website for the latest return policy, terms of use, and customer service contact information. Business policies are subject to change. Who Should Consider LipoJaro? Identifying the Ideal User Profile LipoJaro is designed for individuals seeking support in managing weight-related challenges using a non-stimulant, plant-based approach. While it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for people who struggle with appetite control, cravings, and slow metabolism—especially those looking to avoid harsh ingredients or quick-fix gimmicks. Based on the ingredients and reported effects, LipoJaro may be a good fit for the following groups: Why the Stimulant-Free Approach Appeals to a Broader Audience Many people avoid traditional fat burners due to side effects such as anxiety, heart palpitations, or disrupted sleep. LipoJaro’snon-stimulant formula allows for daily use without triggering the nervous system or interfering with natural energy cycles. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking gentle, sustainable weight management rather than short-term energy spikes. Additionally, the inclusion of fiber-based ingredients like glucomannan and digestion-enhancing compounds such as black pepper extract can appeal to people dealing with bloating, irregularity, or sluggish digestion—factors that can all contribute to weight retention. Disclaimer: LipoJaro is not intended for individuals under 18, those with swallowing difficulties, or anyone diagnosed with a medical condition without physician approval. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any new dietary supplement. Who Might Not Benefit While LipoJaro is formulated to be accessible and well-tolerated, it may not suit everyone. Individuals expecting rapid fat loss, or those who are not committed to making lifestyle adjustments alongside supplement use, may not achieve optimal outcomes.

Natural weight loss starts here—LipoJaro is trusted by thousands. Shop today for powerful appetite support with no side effects! How to Use LipoJaro for Maximum Benefit Following the Suggested Routine for Effective Results To get the most from any dietary supplement—especially one designed for non-stimulant metabolic support—consistency and proper timing matter. LipoJaro is formulated with ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, and green tea extract that work best when taken regularly and in conjunction with balanced lifestyle habits. According to the manufacturer, the recommended usage is to take two capsules per day, ideally 30 minutes before your two largest meals of the day, such as breakfast and lunch. This allows the ingredients to interact with food intake and support satiety before eating begins. Taking the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water is essential, particularly because glucomannan expands in the stomach to promote a sense of fullness. This hydration step is critical—not just for effectiveness, but for safety. Disclaimer: Never take LipoJaro dry or without sufficient water, as this could pose a choking hazard. Individuals with difficulty swallowing should not use this product. Tips for Integrating LipoJaro Into Your Daily Routine To optimize your experience with LipoJaro, consider the following best practices: What to Avoid While Taking LipoJaro Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, it may be best to avoid pairing it with other fiber-heavy products or additional appetite suppressants without guidance from a healthcare provider. Overdoing fiber can lead to bloating or discomfort, especially if not spaced out properly. Additionally, combining LipoJaro with stimulant-based fat burners could be redundant and may offset its balanced, gentle effects. Disclaimer: Always read ingredient labels when combining supplements. If you are currently using other weight management products, consult a healthcare professional before adding LipoJaro to your routine. A Support Tool, Not a Standalone Solution LipoJaro works best when it's part of a bigger strategy that includes healthy meals, mindful eating, and light to moderate activity. While the supplement may help reduce calorie intake by encouraging smaller portion sizes and minimizing cravings, it is not intended to replace food, medication, or professional health guidance. When used with intention and discipline, LipoJaro may provide valuable support in staying on track, particularly for individuals prone to overeating or struggling with energy dips that derail consistent habits.

Science & Clinical Support The Research Behind LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro as a branded supplement has not been subjected to its own clinical trials, several of its key ingredients are supported by independent studies and scientific literature that examine their potential roles in appetite control, fat metabolism, and digestive health. The formulation reflects a common evidence-informed strategy used in modern weight management supplements: targeting multiple metabolic pathways without relying on synthetic stimulants. Below is a breakdown of some of the research associated with LipoJaro’s core ingredients, including how they may function in the body to support weight wellness. Disclaimer: The following summary includes third-party research on individual ingredients. These studies do not imply guaranteed results from LipoJaro. Always consult with your healthcare provider before relying on supplements for clinical support. Glucomannan and Appetite Regulation Glucomannan is one of the most studied soluble fibers in the context of weight management. According to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Obesity, participants who took glucomannan before meals showed greater reductions in body weight compared to a placebo group, primarily due to improved satiety and reduced calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) and Fat Oxidation CLA has been examined for its possible impact on body composition. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reviewed 18 studies and found that CLA supplementation produced modest fat loss over time in overweight individuals. Green Tea Extract and Thermogenic Support Green tea extract—particularly its catechins like EGCG—has shown potential in increasing energy expenditure and supporting fat oxidation. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that green tea extract enhanced fat burning during exercise. Garcinia Cambogia and Craving Control Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been examined for its effects on appetite and serotonin levels. Some studies suggest it may reduce calorie intake by promoting a sensation of fullness. Chromium and Blood Sugar Support Chromium has been studied for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Maintaining stable blood sugar can influence hunger patterns and help reduce cravings for sweets or processed carbohydrates. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract) for Absorption BioPerine is frequently added to enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs and utilizes ingredients more efficiently. This compound does not directly affect fat loss but may improve the overall efficacy of the supplement. LipoJaro’s ingredient profile reflects an alignment with clinical research, focusing on appetite control, energy utilization, and digestive health—all without harsh stimulants. Though more research is always needed on supplement synergy and long-term use, the product is formulated in a way that mirrors many successful strategies in modern wellness science.

Expert Opinions: What Health Professionals Say How Today’s Wellness Experts View LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro has not been formally endorsed by a specific medical organization or clinical board, many of its individual ingredients reflect trends and strategies endorsed by integrative nutritionists and holistic health professionals. These experts often encourage a whole-body, stimulant-free approach to metabolic wellness—an approach that mirrors LipoJaro’s formulation. Given the increasing awareness of gut health, fiber intake, and blood sugar regulation in weight management, many professionals now emphasize the importance of dietary support that does not rely on chemical stimulants or extreme restriction. Supplements like LipoJaro that combine soluble fiber, thermogenic botanicals, and absorption-enhancing compounds offer a balanced alternative for individuals seeking gentle assistance in their health journey. Disclaimer: The opinions shared below reflect general statements from professionals on key ingredients used in LipoJaro. These are not direct endorsements of the product and should not replace individualized medical advice. Nutritionist Insight on Glucomannan Functional nutritionists often highlight glucomannan as a leading ingredient in natural appetite support. By expanding in the stomach and slowing digestion, it may help reduce overeating, especially when consumed with adequate water before meals. According to registered dietitians, soluble fiber like glucomannan plays a dual role: it supports satiety and improves digestive health. These benefits are particularly important for those who struggle with energy dips caused by blood sugar spikes after large meals. Professional Support for CLA and Green Tea Extract In the field of sports nutrition and weight management coaching, CLA and green tea extract are often used for individuals who need metabolic support without the overstimulation of caffeine-based products. These ingredients are praised for their ability to complement regular activity and healthy eating, not replace it. Practitioners point out that green tea catechins, in particular, may assist with mild thermogenesis and antioxidant defense, both of which are relevant for long-term wellness and recovery. Emphasis on Safe and Gentle Supplementation One key message echoed by many professionals is the importance of realistic expectations and personalization. Most experts agree that fat burners are not magic solutions—but when used with structure and discipline, a well-designed formula like LipoJaro may be a reasonable option for individuals needing support with consistency, especially in the areas of appetite control and daily routine management. They also value formulations that avoid harsh chemicals or artificial additives, which aligns with LipoJaro’s clean-label promise and manufacturing standards. As public understanding of metabolism, digestion, and long-term weight regulation continues to grow, more health professionals are embracing tools that gently support the body's natural systems rather than override them with temporary, high-intensity effects. LipoJaro fits this emerging philosophy by focusing on balance, sustainability, and ingredient integrity. LipoJaro vs Other Weight Loss Supplements How LipoJaro Stands Out in a Crowded Market With countless weight loss supplements competing for attention, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between products that offer real support and those built around marketing hype. LipoJaro differentiates itself by embracing a non-stimulant, clean-label approach that caters to individuals looking for sustainable weight management support without sacrificing long-term health. Unlike many traditional fat burners that rely heavily on caffeine or synthetic ingredients to trigger short-term effects like rapid energy bursts or dehydration-induced water loss, LipoJaro offers a plant-based formula that works gradually with the body to help regulate appetite, optimize digestion, and support fat metabolism. Comparison Factors to Consider 1. Formulation Strategy 2. Intended Use and User Sensitivity 3. Transparency and Clean Labeling 4. Customer-Centric Policies Disclaimer: All supplement comparisons are made based on available product information as of the time of writing. Individual product effectiveness and user satisfaction may vary. Always refer to official sources before making purchase decisions. Ideal for a Wellness-Focused Audience LipoJaro is better suited to consumers who value long-term health and are not seeking dramatic overnight transformations. It aligns with 2025 trends in personalized nutrition, gut health optimization, and non-stimulant metabolic support. Those who are already practicing mindful eating and incorporating regular movement may find it particularly helpful in curbing excess hunger and reinforcing dietary structure. By contrast, more aggressive fat burners may appeal to competitive athletes or short-term transformation seekers—but often at the expense of tolerability or holistic health.

Taken before meals with water, it expands in the stomach to help reduce calorie intake and cravings throughout the day. How do I take LipoJaro for best results?

Can LipoJaro help me lose weight without diet or exercise? LipoJaro is intended to support healthy weight management when used as part of a comprehensive lifestyle plan.

Title: Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Apple Final Cut Pro: Which Video Editing App Should You Use?
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/video-editing/29704/adobe-premiere-pro-vs-apple-final-cut-pro-which-video-editing-app-should-you-use
Time Published: 2025-05-06T18:36:26Z
Full Content:
Apple's Final Cut Pro gives you a wealth of powerful video editing tools in a relatively simple interface, making it well worth the one-time price for professionals and serious hobbyists alike. VS Adobe Premiere Pro is an expansive, professional-level video editing program with top-notch editing tools, swift rendering speeds, useful collaboration features, and a well-designed interface. Adobe Premiere Pro requires a Creative Cloud subscription. You have three main options: an annual plan you pay up front ($263.88), an annual plan you pay monthly ($22.99 per month), or a month-to-month plan ($34.49 per month). Adobe also offers more affordable plans for students and pricier ones for businesses. If you want the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a raft of other Adobe creative software, you need to pay $59.99 per month. The subscription model not only gets you program updates, which Adobe delivers semiannually, but also 100GB of cloud storage for syncing media. Any of these plans entitles you to activate the software on just two computers. A perpetual license for Final Cut Pro costs $299.99. It works out to be cheaper than Premiere Pro after just a year and a half, and you still get feature updates. Final Cut Pro is available from the Mac App Store, which eases the process of downloading updates and lets you install the program on multiple computers as long as you sign into the same Apple account. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro runs on both Windows and macOS. The online user guide states that it is the company's policy "to support the current and the most recent previous version of each operating system." For the moment, that means Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11 with: On macOS, you need version 12 or later with: Premiere Pro runs on Apple silicon–based Macs natively. As you might expect, Final Cut Pro runs only on Macs. It requires macOS 14.6 or later, 8GB of RAM (it recommends 16GB), and a Metal-capable graphics card for Intel-based computers. For VR headset support, you also need SteamVR. Final Cut Pro runs smoothly on Apple silicon–based Macs as a native application. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro stays true to the tradition of high-end, professional-level software. Ease of use and simplicity of interface are not paramount among its goals. That said, there's no reason that a determined amateur with time to devote to learning the software couldn’t use it. Adobe has other products more appropriate for hobbyists, including Premiere Elements. Apple makes the upgrade path from its consumer-level video editor, iMovie, very smooth. The latest version of Final Cut on the desktop also makes it easy to import projects you started on an iPhone or iPad. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro uses a traditional nonlinear editor (NLE) timeline with tracks and track heads. It calls your timeline content a sequence, and you can create nested sequences, subsequences, and subclips to keep everything organized. The timeline has tabs for multiple sequences, which can be helpful if you're working with nested sequences. Longtime video editors are likely more comfortable with this setup than with Apple's more inventive trackless Magnetic Timeline. Adobe's system also fits with some pro workflows in which the tracks are in an expected arrangement. It works differently from consumer video editing apps, however, because it automatically separates a clip's audio track from its video. The timeline is very scalable and offers the usual razor, ripple, roll, slip, and slide tools. The interface is extremely configurable, letting you undock any and all panels. You can show or hide FX badges, keyframes, thumbnails, and waveforms. You get seven preconfigured workspaces (including Assembly, Editing, Color, and Titles) compared with Final Cut's mere three. Apple's innovative trackless Magnetic Timeline is easier on the eyes than the traditional timeline interface, and it offers several editing advantages, such as connected Auditions, clips, and roles (descriptive labels such as Dialog, Effects, Music, Titles, and Video). Auditions let you designate optional clips or takes for a spot in your movie, and you can group clips into compound clips—roughly the equivalent of Premiere's Nested Sequences. Instead of tracks, Final Cut Pro uses lanes, with a primary storyline that everything else attaches to. This makes keeping everything in sync easier than in Premiere. Final Cut Pro's interface is less configurable than Premiere's. You can't split panels off into windows, except for the Preview window, which is very spare in the control department—the only options are Play and Pause. Premiere offers a lot more here, with buttons for Export Frame, Extract, Go to In, Go to Previous Edit Point, Lift, and Step Back. As mentioned, Final Cut offers just three prebuilt workspaces (Color & Effects, Default, and Organize). Winner: Tie Like a traditional NLE, Premiere Pro lets you store related media in bins, which are similar to folders. As with folders, you can have bins within bins. You can also apply color labels to assets, but not keyword tags. The Libraries panel lets you share assets among other Adobe applications, such as After Effects and Photoshop. Apple's program organizes your media through events, keyword tagging, libraries, and roles. The library is the overarching container that includes your projects, events, and clips, and it keeps track of all your edits and options. You can also manage storage targets and perform batch clip renaming. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro works with pretty much any media format of any level of professionalism, as well as media type for which you installed codecs on your computer. That even includes Apple ProRes. The software supports working with native (raw) camera formats, including those for ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony. There's not much video you can create or import that Premiere can't handle. It even supports XML documents you export from Final Cut Pro.Final Cut Pro works with the HEVC codec that many 4K video cameras and Apple's iPhones use. Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut supports native formats from all the major video camera makers, including ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony, as well as many video-capable still cameras. It, too, handles XML file imports and exports.Winner: Tie After Effects, Premiere's stablemate in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, is the industry-standard motion graphics tool. It dovetails smoothly with Premiere Pro but is more difficult to master than Apple Motion, which now has many of the same capabilities. Regardless, After Effects is the tool to learn if you want to pursue professional video editing as a career. The app costs $263.88 per year. Apple Motion is also a powerful tool for creating effects, titles, and transitions. It supports custom templates, logical layers, and a rich plug-in ecosystem. Motion is probably a better fit if you use Final Cut Pro as your primary editor. Even if you don't, it's just a one-time, $49.99 purchase.Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro The latest generative AI feature to land in Adobe's video software is Generative Extend, which creates extra video frames (including 4K) from the surrounding content for cases in which a clip isn't quite long enough to fit the rest of your timeline. Other Premiere Pro features include AI speech-to-text with automatic translation, color management that recognizes raw and log footage and automatically color-corrects it, and Media Intelligence, which recognizes clip contents to help you find them. Apple's pro video editor is playing catch-up with Premiere Pro. It now includes auto-captioning from speech in videos, but still lacks both text-based editing and video generation capabilities. It does, however, integrate with macOS's Image Playground to generate cartoon-like still images, for what that's worth. Magnetic Mask (apply effects just to fine-tuned masked areas) and Scene Removal round out some of the other recent AI tools in the app. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro includes the Lumetri Color tools. These are pro-level color grading features that were formerly part of the standalone SpeedGrade application. The Lumetri tools support 3D lookup tables (LUTs) for powerful and customizable looks. The tools offer a remarkable amount of color manipulation, along with a great selection of film and HDR looks. You can adjust black point, contrast, exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance—all of which you can activate with keyframes. Faded Film, Saturation, Sharpen, and Vibrance adjustment presets are also available. Most impressive are the Color Wheel and Curves options. The Lumetri Scope view is also especially cool; it shows the current frame's proportional use of red, green, and blue. As mentioned, Premiere Pro includes a dedicated workspace for color editing. To compete with Adobe's impressive Lumetri Color tools, Final Cut has a Color Wheel tool that's impressive in its own right. Color Wheels show a puck in the middle that lets you move an image toward green, blue, or red; the result appears to the side of the wheel. You can also adjust brightness and saturation with the wheels, separately control everything (with the Master wheel), or adjust just shadows, midtones, or highlights. It's a remarkably powerful and intuitive set of tools. If wheels are not to your taste, the Color Board option shows a simple linear view of your color settings. The Color Curves tool lets you use multiple control points to adjust each of the three primary colors for very specific points on the brightness scale. Luma, RGB Parade, and Vectorscope monitors give you incredible insight into your movie's color usage. You can even edit a single color value using a dropper. Final Cut now supports color LUTs from camera manufacturers such as ARRI, Canon, Red, and Sony, as well as custom LUTs for effects. You can combine these effects with others in a stacked arrangement. Color scopes adapt to HDR editing, as do the color editing tools. Supported formats include Rec. 2020 HLG and Rec. 2020 PQ for HDR10 output.Winner: Tie Premiere offers Photoshop-like control over title text formatting, with a vast number of adjustments and fonts such as kerning, leading, rotation, shadow, stroking, and tracking, just to name a few. But for 3D manipulation, you need to head to After Effects. For captions, Premiere Pro is a hard act to follow: It not only creates captions from spoken words in your video, but, as mentioned, it also lets you edit based on the captions. As a result, you can take out ums and uhs in the video simply by removing the text from the caption. Premiere can then automatically translate the captions into 27 international languages and display multiple language tracks at once. Final Cut Pro includes strong 3D title editing with keyframe motion options. You get lots of control over title overlays, with dozens of animation templates. You edit text and position and size the titles right in the video preview; there's no need for an external title editor. Final Cut Pro's 3D Titles offer eight basic templates and four more cinematic ones, including a cool 3D Earth choice for sci-fi projects. There are 20 font presets, but you can use any style and size you like. Materials such as concrete, fabric, and plastic give your titles any texture you desire. You also get a bunch of lighting options. For maximum control, you can edit the 3D titles in Motion. Extrude 2D titles into 3D by tapping the 3D Text option in the Text Inspector, and you can then position and rotate the text to taste on three axes. Apple's software can now automatically transcribe spoken words in clips to text captions, but Premiere Pro goes way beyond that, identifying separate speakers, translating, and allowing text-based timeline editing. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro lets you play 360-degree VR footage and change the field of view and angle. You can watch this content in anaglyphic form, which is a fancy way of saying you can see it in 3D using standard red-and-blue glasses. You can also have your video track a head-mounted display's view. You can't use Premiere Pro (or Final Cut Pro) to edit 360-degree footage unless you stitch it into equirectangular format. Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector, and Pinnacle Studio can all open 360-degree footage without this conversion. You can't see the spherical view alongside the flattened view in Premiere like in those apps, but you can easily toggle between them if you add the VR button to the preview window. Helpfully, Premiere lets you tag a video as VR so that Facebook or YouTube can tell it's 360-degree content. Apple's pro video editor now has better 360-degree features, including support for Apple's VisionPro and the HTC Vive (sorry Meta Quest users). It offers 360-degree titles, some effects, and a nifty Patch tool that removes the camera and tripod from your movie. With the standalone Compressor app ($49.99), you can share 360-degree video directly to Facebook, Vimeo, and YouTube. You also get stabilization for 360-degree video. Winner: Tie Premiere Pro's Audio Mixer shows balance, mute/solo, clipping indicator, pan, volume unit (VU) meter controls for all timeline tracks. You can use it to make adjustments as the project plays. The app automatically creates new tracks when you drop an audio clip in the timeline, and you can specify types, such as 5.1, adaptive, mono, standard (which can contain a combination of mono and stereo files), and stereo. Double-clicking the VU meters or panning dials returns their levels to zero. The audio meters next to Premiere's timeline are resizable and let you solo any track. The program also supports hardware controllers and third-party VSP plug-ins. If you have Adobe Audition, you can round-trip your audio between that and Premiere Pro for advanced techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, automatic click removal, compression, parametric EQ, and studio reverb. Audio editing is a strength of Final Cut Pro. It can automatically fix hum, noise, and peaks, or you can manually take care of these problems. Over 1,300 royalty-free sound effects are available, as are a long list of plug-ins. One impressive trick is the ability to match separately recorded tracks. For example, if you shoot HD footage with a DSLR and record sound simultaneously on another recorder, the Match Audio feature aligns the sound source (Premiere Pro has a similar feature). Support for Apple Logic Pro plug-ins gives you even more powerful sound editing options. Finally, you get a surround-sound mixer to animate or locate 5.1 audio, as well as either a 10- or 31-band equalizer.Winner: Tie Premiere Pro offers more export formats than you are ever likely to need. You get even more options via the Media Encoder app, which can target Blu-ray, DVD, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo formats. Encoder lets you batch encode to target multiple devices in a single job, such as mobile phones, iPads, and HDTVs. Premiere can also output media using H.265 and the Rec. 2020 color space. Adobe's updated Export interface mode makes the process simpler yet more powerful; it lets you choose multiple social targets. Final Cut Pro's output options are comparatively limited unless you add the companion application, Apple Compressor. The base app can, however, export to XML and produce HDR, wide-color-space output including Rec. 2020 Hybrid Log Gamma and Rec. 2020 HDR10. Compressor adds the ability to customize output settings and perform batch output jobs. It also adds support for Blu-ray and DVD menus and chapter themes. You can even package movies in the format necessary for iTunes. Winner: Tie Like most modern video editors, Premiere Pro uses proxy views of your video content to speed up apparent performance, and I didn't encounter any lag while testing normal editing operations. The software takes advantage of graphics CUDA and OpenCL hardware acceleration and multicore CPUs with its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. Premiere Pro locks the app during exporting by default, though you can get around this behavior by choosing Queue in the Export dialog via the Media Encoder app. One of the primary goals of Final Cut Pro is to take advantage of 64-bit processing and the newer Apple silicon chips. Conveniently, exporting in Final Cut happens in the background, so you can continue working in the program. I test export time by creating a 5-minute movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. My test media files include some 8K and more 4K source clips. I render it to H.264 1080p, 60fps, using H.264 High Profile. The audio is AAC 192Kbps. For testing, I use a MacBook Air with an M1 processor and 8GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia. It's on the low end of power for video editing, so it shows differences more distinctly than more expensive hardware. Premiere Pro easily bested Final Cut Pro. The former completed the task in 170 seconds, while the latter required 205 seconds. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe maintains a large ecosystem of creative apps and services to support Premiere Pro. Aside from the Creative Cloud apps that work smoothly with Premiere, including After Effects, Audition, and Photoshop, Adobe offers the Premiere Rush mobile app, from which you can import projects. Adobe Express and Firefly, both of which you get with a Premiere subscription, include powerful AI video generation capabilities. Another app, Adobe Capture, lets you snap images for use as colors, shapes, and textures in Premiere Pro. Adobe's support for Frame.io collaboration and cloud storage is important for professional use. Other lesser-known Creative Cloud apps include Adobe Character Animator, a nifty app that produces animations based on live actors' faces and body movements, and Animate, which does the same for illustrations. You can bring both types of projects into Premiere Pro. Finally, the Adobe Stock integration comes in handy for those times you need B-roll or other stock media. Unfortunately, Stock is not part of a Premiere Pro subscription; plans start at $29.99 per month. It's a snap to import projects from iMovie on an iPhone or iPad into the pro editor, as mentioned. And that goes for the newer Final Cut Camera app, available on iPhone and iPad. The Final Cut iPad app ($4.99 per month) allows multicam shooting, as does the Camera app. The already-mentioned Motion and Compressor sibling applications, along with Apple's high-end sound editor, Logic Pro, extend the program's capabilities, but that collection of apps can't compete with Premiere Pro's. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software. I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time. I was privileged to byline the cover story of the last print issue of PC Magazine, the Windows 7 review, and I’ve witnessed every Microsoft win and misstep up to the latest Windows 11. I’m an avid bird photographer and traveler—I’ve been to 40 countries, many with great birds! Because I’m also a classical music fan and former performer, I’ve reviewed streaming services that emphasize classical music. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Best Dividend Stocks for Steady Passive Income

If you want your money to work for you, dividend stocks are one of the smartest ways to build steady passive income over time. Many investors, from beginners to retirees, rely on dividends to supplement their income without having to sell their shares. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the best dividend stocks, how to choose them, and which ones to consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Contents Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. These payments are typically made quarterly, though some companies pay monthly or annually. Unlike growth stocks that reinvest most of their earnings to expand the business, dividend-paying companies are usually more established and focus on rewarding shareholders. Key Features of Dividend Stocks: Dividend investing is popular for many reasons: When searching for the best dividend stocks, you need to look beyond just the dividend yield. Here are some key metrics: This is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock’s current price. A higher yield means more income, but extremely high yields can be a red flag. This measures how much of a company’s earnings are paid out in dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally better, suggesting the company has room to grow or weather downturns. Look for companies that consistently increase their dividends year after year. This shows financial strength and shareholder commitment. Stable earnings mean the company can maintain or grow its dividend even in tough economic times. This is the cash left after operational expenses and capital expenditures. It’s a more accurate indicator of dividend sustainability. These are well-established companies with reliable dividends and strong financials. Think Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson. Companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Firms with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases. These are required to pay out 90% of their income as dividends. Examples include Realty Income and American Tower. Stable and regulated businesses that provide consistent dividends. Now let’s dive into some of the best dividend stocks to consider for steady passive income. If you’re more risk-tolerant and looking for higher income, consider these: Spread your investments across different industries to reduce risk. Use DRIP plans to compound your returns over time. Hold dividend stocks in Roth IRAs or tax-deferred accounts to avoid unnecessary taxes. Don’t just chase high yields—balance them with companies that offer stability and growth. Keep an eye on earnings reports, dividend announcements, and economic conditions. If picking individual stocks feels overwhelming, dividend ETFs are a great alternative. Even strong companies can reduce or eliminate dividends during tough times. Stock prices can fluctuate, even if the dividend remains steady. If dividend growth doesn’t keep up with inflation, purchasing power may decline. Rising interest rates can hurt utility and REIT stocks. Investing in the best dividend stocks can be a game-changer for anyone looking to earn steady, passive income. With a little research, patience, and diversification, you can build a dividend portfolio that supports your financial goals now and in the future. Whether you’re saving for retirement, supplementing your income, or just want your money to work smarter, dividend stocks offer a reliable path to financial independence.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected last month, other labor market indicators are not so ... More optimistic. As part of my job, I spend quite a bit of time each week speaking with job-seekers and perusing job boards to see who is hiring and for what positions. In the last month, one thing has been—at least anecdotally—clear: More job postings are popping up. Friday’s job numbers confirmed this trend. The U.S. added 177,000 new jobs in April, higher than analysts’ expectations, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wages also rose 3.8% year-over-year to a record average of $36.06 an hour for nonfarm employees. But economists are warning against too much optimism from Friday’s report. For one, the private sector added only 62,000 jobs in April, less than half of what analysts expected as employers held tight in the face of the expected impact from tariffs, marking the slowest job growth in the sector since July 2024. “Unease is the word of the day,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP said in the company’s national employment report. Then there are the layoff numbers. While unemployment remained flat at 4.2%, layoffs increased by 63% compared to last April, though they decreased month-over-month. DOGE-related cuts accounted for almost half of all layoffs, either by directly cutting government positions or by the downstream effects of such cuts. And increased hiring numbers could be a result of companies’ front-ending against tariff and macroeconomic impacts, preparing themselves for tougher times. Still, President Trump was optimistic, celebrating “strong employment” numbers. We’ll be keeping our eyes out to see how things shake up, especially as the class of 2025 joins the market. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. When the roles are flipped, how should you deliver bad news to your boss? In the world of hypercommunication, here is how to make sure you’re communicating effectively. An increasing number of workers are taking microretirements to prevent burnout. Watch out for these signs that you could be the first cut in a layoff. News from the world of work. AI startups are increasingly requiring their employees to work six or seven days a week, Forbes’ Richard Nieva reports. While hustle culture has always been glorified in Silicon Valley, this could be the first time companies are brazen enough to advertise the long-hour expectations. The Philippines is the latest country to offer a digital nomad visa for remote workers. The requirements are quite standard, including proving you are able to generate sufficient income outside the country. Feeling understaffed? It’s not just your company. The Wall Street Journal found that while corporate America isn’t massively laying off workers, many have paused hiring and are leaving more jobs unfilled. Turns out laying off employees and replacing them with AI is not as easy—or effective—as it looks. A new survey found that 55% of leaders who let go of workers as a direct result of deploying more AI functions admit they made the wrong decision. Under President Trump, the IRS has shed more than 11% of its workforce, and more cuts are on the way, Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb reports. Layoffs at the agency have impacted workers across the country, including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, with tax auditors being the hardest hit.

Title: Trump says pharmaceutical tariffs are coming. Here's what to expect
URL: https://qz.com/trump-tariffs-pharma-companies-astrazeneca-gsk-1851779389
Time Published: 2025-05-06T17:53:00Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are headed to the medicine aisle next. On Monday, Trump announced his plans to place tariffs on pharmaceutical imports “within the next two weeks,” signing an executive order designed to boost drug companies’ manufacturing in the U.S. While the exact tariff rates haven’t yet been specified, the president has suggested they could be as high as 200%. “We don’t want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we’re in a war, we’re in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,” Trump said in a fact sheet. “As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.” The president’s executive order gives U.S. agencies a clear message: Move faster. Trump has directed the FDA to speed up approvals for domestic manufacturing facilities while promising more surprise inspections of overseas plants and raising inspection fees for foreign drugmakers. Meanwhile, the EPA is being told to fast-track construction permits for pharmaceutical facilities. The White House has estimated that it can take five to 10 years to build manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it says is “unacceptable from a national security standpoint.” The Commerce Department launched a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports in April, paving the way for these tariffs. That’s the same provision the Trump administration previously used to justify sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018. “Pharma companies are going to come roaring back, they’re coming roaring back, they’re all coming back to our country, because if they don’t, they got a big tax to pay,” Trump said in his original “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2. But the president’s move to promote U.S. manufacturing by placing tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry could backfire. Pharmaceutical companies are already navigating tight margins and global competition. Broad tariffs on imported drugs could lead to higher prices for patients and supply disruptions in a system that’s already under strain. Drug companies had previously enjoyed favorable trade terms, particularly under a 1994 World Trade Organization agreement that set low or zero tariffs on finished products and key active ingredients. In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $200 billion of pharmaceutical products — and about 73% came from European countries that have long served as manufacturing hubs for the industry. Ireland, Germany and Switzerland were the top three jurisdictions for U.S. pharmaceutical imports, according to consulting firm PwC. And many of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in medicines that are sold in the U.S. are made abroad, particularly in India and China. The tariffs’ implications could be significant for companies based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The U.K. exported $8.1 billion in pharmaceuticals (one of the sovereign state’s top imports) to the U.S. in 2023, with around $4.1 billion originating from U.K.-based production. Global giants GSK (GSK+1.80%) and AstraZeneca (AZN+0.03%) are both based in the U.K., making them vulnerable to any proposed import taxes. Both companies plan to lobby hard to shield the sector from such tariffs, joining a group that successfully secured temporary exemptions for pharmaceuticals from a 10% baseline tariff that Trump previously levied on many other foreign goods. But with the president’s tariff announcement looming, the pressure is on for these companies to either relocate manufacturing to the U.S. or risk facing a hefty price tag. A 2023 analysis conducted by Ernst & Young found that a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports could lead to an increase of up to $51 billion a year in drug costs, potentially raising prices for consumers by as much as 12.9%. Giovanni Barbella, the global head of strategy and supply chain at the Swiss generic drugmaker Sandoz (NVS-0.56%), told The Guardian that tariffs would lead to supply disruptions and price increases, hitting U.S. patients hardest. “We are producing products on a very tight margin,” Barbella said. “That’s the nature of our industry. So ultimately, higher production cost, including the cost of tariffs, will lead to higher prices.” The Association for Accessible Medicines warned in February that tariffs could strain cash-strapped generic drugmakers and distributors, potentially leading to increased costs for patients and disruptions in the supply chain. “There can be even more supply disruption, because some players can leave the [U.S.] market and focus on markets where they can make more business,” Barbella added. “So ultimately, the risk is that the U.S. patient will suffer the most.” The U.S. is already battling a record number of drug shortages, from cancer medications to antibiotics. Nearly 270 drugs were on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ official list of active drug shortages as of early 2025. Many of these shortages stem from global supply chain issues, including reliance on single-source manufacturers overseas. Tariffs could worsen the situation by discouraging imports or driving up costs to unsustainable levels. For patients, this could mean delayed treatments or forced switches to less effective alternatives. And for hospitals and insurers, it could translate to higher costs and more administrative headaches. Mark Samuels, the CEO of Medicines UK, which represents Britain-based generic drugmakers, told The Guardian that, “in an insurance-based system as the U.S. has, if medicine costs increase and insurance runs out, then that does increase the risk that people either can’t afford to complete their cancer treatments or pay for it altogether.” Those comments — and the substantial risks rising drug costs pose — were echoed by Gareth Sheridan, the CEO of the Irish-founded pharmaceutical company Nutriband. “These types of treatments can’t afford a disruption in the global supply chain,” Sheridan told the BBC. “As a comparable situation: tariffs on automobiles. You can’t afford a BMW? Buy a Ford and you can still get to work. If you have a 25% hike on chemotherapy and you can’t afford your treatment any more, what’s the alternative? I mean, ultimately, people are going to die.” Some major pharmaceutical companies are already trying to adapt, announcing major investments in U.S.-based manufacturing. To insulate themselves from any potential tariffs, Swiss pharma giants Roche (RHHBY-0.05%) and Novartis are committing $50 billion and $23 billion, respectively, to U.S. investments over the coming years. In November, AstraZeneca announced a $3.5 billion investment and recently confirmed it will shift production of certain U.S.-bound drugs from Europe to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%), the producer of diabetes and weight-loss medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, is allocating at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) plans to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research over the next four years. The company, which has its headquarters in New Jersey, could be especially affected by any new U.S. tariffs due to its extensive production footprint across Europe, including operations in the U.K., Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium. But even with these moves, shifting production on a large scale is neither quick nor easy. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s (PFE+1.72%) CEO, said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call that the New York-based firm could undertake “tremendous investments” in the U.S. if there were clearer trade policies and if tariff threats were removed. The company’s chief financial officer, Dave Denton, said that the already existing tariffs are expected to cost the company around $150 million in 2025. And analysts say that’s a real risk: If costs go up and regulatory uncertainty grows, drugmakers may delay projects or pass costs onto consumers. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%), the Danish company behind blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also feel the squeeze. While it has a growing U.S. presence — including a major site in North Carolina and more than 10,000 U.S.-based employees — it imports some finished products and components from Europe. Still, Novo Nodisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the company’s operations in the U.S. would be sufficient “to a large degree. ... The base case is that this is something we can handle.” Trump has yet to formally specify a rate for these pharmaceutical tariffs. The full consequences of the administration’s policy will unfold as pharmaceutical companies adjust their strategies in the coming months. With significant stakes at play for both the U.S. economy and global health systems, it remains to be seen how the president’s approach will ultimately shake out. For now, drugmakers and consumers alike must prepare for what could be a bumpy road ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Vornado Realty Trust Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Vornado Realty Trust posted better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, and provided more details on its massive 70-year lease with New York University (NYU), sending its stock higher by more than 3 percent on Tuesday afternoon. The real estate giant reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $126.2 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, above the 55 cents per diluted share reported for the same period last year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. Net income for the first quarter was $86.8 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, above the net loss of 5 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $461.5 million for 2025’s first quarter, exceeding the $436.3 million reported for last year’s first quarter. It also beat the Zacks estimate by 3 percent. Vornado attributed its strong quarterly performance to the $350 million sale of a portion of Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo’s flagship store at 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, the ground rent at its Penn 1 building being set nearly $11 million lower than Vornado expected — although at a price which is still under litigation — and strong leasing activity in Manhattan. “Manhattan continues to be the best real estate market in the country, especially so for office, but also for apartments and retail,” Steven Roth, CEO of Vornado, said on the company’s earnings call. “In the 180 million-square-foot Class A better building market in which we compete, demand continues to be robust.” On Monday, Vornado announced the completion of the 1.1 million-square-foot, 70-year master lease at 770 Broadway with NYU, which it first mentioned in November. The university made a prepaid lease payment of $935 million to Vornado and will make annual lease payments of $9.3 million for the entire life of the lease, Vornado said. Vornado was facing a hole in the property after Facebook parent Meta said it would drop 275,000 square feet once its lease expired, but NYU swooped in to take over the entire building. “We use a portion of the prepaid rent payment to repay the $700 million mortgage loan, which previously encumbered the property, and $200 million to increase our cash balances,” Roth said on the call. “Though, this transaction is a lease … it is treated as a sale.” Vornado had an active quarter of leasing activity across the retail and office space for the 2025 first quarter. The company leased 1.04 million square feet across its portfolio — 709,000 square feet of that in New York City — and commanded starting rents of $95 per square foot, Roth said. That includes the 337,000 square feet Universal Music signed at Penn 2. At the start of the earnings call, Roth acknowledged that the current macroeconomic environment is very different from its fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Still, despite political and economic uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Roth has a positive outlook going forward, saying tariffs could “make a big dent in getting our federal budget deficit under control.” “Notwithstanding the tactics, reducing government bloat has to be a good thing,” Roth said. “I am agnostic, whatever the outcome. I believe that this global kerfuffle will be resolved more quickly than you think.” Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang said AI has revived a dying San Francisco that many thought wouldn’t recover from the pandemic. “It’s because of AI that San Francisco is back,” Huang said while speaking to Jacob Helberg, Trump’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, at The Hill & Valley Forum. “Anybody who lives in San Francisco, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just about everybody evacuated San Francisco,” he said, “Now it’s thriving again. It’s all because of AI.” A 2024 article from The San Francisco Standard called AI companies San Francisco’s “most desired tenants.” It cited a JLL (JLL-1.68%) report that found AI companies leased north of 1.7 million square feet of office space since 2022, when ChatGPT was released. Chris Pham, senior analyst at JLL, predicted a continued AI boom in the city, likening it to the invention of electricity, instead of just another new industry. In his remarks with Helberg, Huang acknowledged that as AI progresses, “new jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, and every job will be changed.” “It’s not AI that’s going to take your job. It’s not AI that’s going to destroy your company,” he said, encouraging widespread adoption of the technology. “It’s the company and the person who uses AI that’s going to take your job. And so that’s something to internalize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: [Latest] U.S. Kids Beverage Market to Hit Valuation of US$ 30.24 Billion By 2033 | Astute Analytica

May 06, 2025 12:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, May 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. kids beverage market is projected was valued at US$ 18.84 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 30.24 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The United States kids beverage market has spent the past thirty-six months in a trial-and-error cycle that is rapidly reshaping category leadership. IRI panel data for 2024 show that 61% of households with children bought at least one “limited-time” flavor over the last year, up from 38% in 2021. Brands that capitalized early—Capri Sun with Strawberry Kiwi Splash, Gatorade Zero Kids with Glacier Freeze, and Honest Kids with Super Fruit Punch—saw unit velocities climb 9–14% even as shelf facings remained flat. Fruit blends now account for 42% of all juice-box UPCs, overtaking single-flavor apple offerings for the first time since records were kept. Within enhanced waters, blue raspberry and cotton-candy variants—once regarded as novelty items—have crossed the 5% share threshold, a milestone usually associated with sustained repeat purchases. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/united-states-kids-beverages-market Flavor churn is, however, only half the story; manufacturers are leveraging real-time social listening to identify micro-trends before they hit mainstream retail in the kids beverage market. PepsiCo’s Stingray dashboard, for example, flags elementary-school lunchbox mentions on TikTok every four hours, feeding that intel to R&D teams that can turn around pilot batches in under ten weeks. The payoff is visible: “Dragonfruit Burst” appeared in Walmart end-caps nationwide just 94 days after first trending online. At the same time, legacy players are pruning underperforming classics—Orange Tang was delisted by two major grocers in Q3-2023—to make room for Gen-Alpha-friendly mashups like mango-peach and watermelon-lime. Stakeholders should therefore view flavor leadership not as a static mantle but as a rolling sprint governed by data-backed agility and nimble co-packer partnerships. Key Findings in United States Kids Beverage Market Functional hydration products reshape wellness narratives for school-aged consumers today in the Kids Beverage Market Wellness claims have become table stakes, but functional hydration adds a science-backed edge that resonates with parents scanning ingredient lists. The 2024 Kids’ Beverage Attributes Survey from SPINS reveals that 47% of U.S. guardians now look for electrolytes, B-vitamins, or prebiotics when purchasing drinks for children aged six to twelve. Propelled by this interest, brands such as Prime Hydration Kids, BODYARMOR Flash I.V., and Pedialyte Sport Junior grew combined unit sales by 28% year over year. Notably, products with 100 mg or less sodium per serving doubled their shelf presence, underscoring a “clean-label electrolyte” narrative that appeals to pediatricians and school administrators striving to curb excess salt. Energy modulation is the second pillar driving functional launches in the United States kids beverage market. Caffeine remains off-limits for under-13s, so formulators are leaning on L-theanine, magnesium, and plant-derived adaptogens to support focus without jitters. DSM-Firmenich reports a 300% surge in requests for water-stable L-theanine emulsions suitable for 6-ounce pouches. Meanwhile, Nestlé’s Boost Kids Essentials fortified drink introduced 4 g of prebiotic fiber to address digestive health, and early ACV scanner data indicate a 12% repeat-purchase rate within eight weeks—an impressive signal for a premium-priced SKU. Parents, buoyed by pediatric health-influencer endorsements on Instagram, appear willing to pay a 35 ¢ per-unit premium if the beverage promises immunity or cognitive benefits validated by peer-reviewed studies. Decision makers should therefore embed clinical substantiation into marketing narratives and consider partnering with children’s hospitals for longitudinal trials, as evidence-based storytelling is rapidly becoming the currency of consumer trust in this evolving segment. Plant-based and dairy-alternative beverages gain traction among allergic children nationwide Food-allergy prevalence among U.S. minors now stands at 8%, according to the CDC’s 2024 summary, fueling demand for plant-based drinks that circumvent common allergens. Soy once dominated the conversation in the kids beverage market, yet Oatly’s 2023 nationwide placement of single-serve oat-milk cartons sparked a 92% velocity increase across K-5 cafeterias operated by Chartwells Schools. Almond and coconut lines remain niche in elementary settings due to tree-nut concerns, but pea-protein formulas—Ripple Kids, for example—have captured a 19% share within the shelf-stable “milk substitutes” aisle. Nutrient density, especially a 50-% higher calcium content versus skim dairy, is a key purchase driver cited by 63% of surveyed parents. Beyond nutritional parity, sustainability messaging bolsters category legitimacy in the kids beverage market. Life-cycle-assessment firm HowGood notes that oat-milk boxes yield 45% lower greenhouse-gas emissions than equivalent UHT cow’s-milk cartons—data now called out via QR codes on pack fronts. Retailers are responding: Kroger expanded its “Plant-Powered Kids” set from eight to twenty-four facings in 2024, while Target’s Good & Gather launched an organic chickpea-milk line at $3.99 per four-pack. Flavor remains critical; chocolate leads, but strawberry oat-milk earned an impressive 4.8-star rating on the Walmart Marketplace within three weeks of debut. As brands explore sunflower-seed bases and fermented rice options, clear allergen statements and school-compliance certification will determine acceptance, underscoring the necessity for rigorous cross-contact controls and transparent labeling strategies. Sugar reduction strategies influence consumer behavior and parental purchase criteria With pediatric obesity rates touching 19.7% in 2023 (CDC), the United States kids beverage market faces relentless scrutiny over added sugars. The FDA’s updated voluntary guidance encourages manufacturers to limit kids’ drinks to 6 g of total sugar per 8 oz serving, down from 10 g previously. Consequently, 72% of new UPCs launched in 2024 utilize high-intensity sweetener blends—stevia-allulose or monk-fruit-erythritol—to achieve a 35–50% caloric cut. Kraft Heinz’s Capri Sun Reformulation 3.0 removed 2.5 billion grams of sugar from U.S. circulation between 2020 and 2024, a stat widely cited in retailer sustainability scorecards. Consumer sentiment validates the shift in the kids beverage market: an Ipsos poll of 1,500 U.S. parents found that 58% are willing to switch brands if sugar grams exceed classroom guidelines, even when price parity does not exist. However, taste remains uncompromised territory; 41% of children aged eight to ten reported “off” aftertaste with first-generation stevia drinks, pushing brands toward next-gen Reb-M and fermented sweeteners that mimic sucrose perception curves. Shelf tags now carry traffic-light icons—green for <5 g, yellow for 5–7 g—implemented by Albertsons in 327 stores, nudging parents at point of sale. Looking forward, tooth-friendly certifications from the American Dental Association and on-pack glycemic-index scores could become differentiators, suggesting that cross-functional R&D teams must synchronize sensory science, regulatory affairs, and marketing to safeguard repeat purchase in an increasingly sugar-averse retail environment. Value-based pricing tiers evolve alongside private label and premium launches Inflationary pressure hit family grocery budgets hard in the kids beverage market, yet the kids beverage category proved resilient by stretching across multiple price ladders. NielsenIQ 52-week data to March 2024 show that unit volumes in the sub-$3 six-pack tier rose 5%, led by Walmart’s Great Value Fruit Punch and Dollar General’s Clover Valley Juice Drinks. Conversely, $1.99 “better-for-you” single-serve bottles—think GoodSport Kids Electrolyte Water—registered a 17% upswing, illustrating K-shaped growth where value and premium both flourish. Notably, private label moved beyond me-too offerings: H-E-B’s Splashers+ includes 30% real fruit and 100% daily vitamin C, competing head-to-head with branded options at a 20% discount. Premiumization thrives on experiential cues in the US kids beverage market. Recyclable aluminum stubby bottles priced at $2.49 each, pioneered by PathWater Kids, signal both quality and eco-values. Parents surveyed by Mintel assign a “social currency” rating of 7.8/10 to premium packs visible in lunchboxes, indicating willingness to trade up for perceived status. Dynamic pricing analytics used by Kroger Precision Marketing reveal that promotional elasticity is two-times higher in households with annual incomes above $120 k, encouraging personalized digital coupons rather than across-the-board discounts. Operators should therefore deploy granular shopper-affinity data: spotlight rock-bottom value packs in food-insecure ZIP codes while upselling functional glass-bottle SKUs through Instacart in affluent suburbs. This bifurcated approach guards margin integrity while preserving volume, a balancing act essential for decision makers aligning portfolio breadth with the diverse economic realities of 2024. Innovative packaging boosts convenience, safety, and recycling participation rates nationwide Packaging has evolved from mere container to value-adding feature in the United States kids beverage market. Tetra Pak’s 2024 School Edge report notes that 54% of administrators now require tethered caps to reduce litter—technology first scaled by Kool-Aid Bursts Reload. Breathing valve pouches, such as those used by Slammers Chill’n, cut choking risk and meet ASTM F963-17 toy safety standards, a specification now embedded in Walmart’s Supplier Playbook. In parallel, spouted pouches with 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content have surged 41% in distribution; they not only reduce pack weight by 70% versus PET but also appeal to eco-conscious Gen-Alpha who routinely learn about recycling in school curricula. Smart packaging amplifies consumer engagement in the kids beverage market. Yakult Kids rolled out NFC-enabled labels that deliver augmented-reality games teaching gut-health facts, driving 2.3 minutes of average dwell time per scan. Meanwhile, Boxed Water Is Better Kids prints QR codes linking to carbon-offset certificates, reinforcing transparency as a brand pillar. Operationally, flat-bottom pouch formats achieve 12% higher pallet density, cutting freight emissions and enabling cost savings passed along in the form of bundle promotions—three packs for $5, a hit at Costco. Looking ahead, compostable high-barrier films from Futamura and Mold-Tek’s in-mold label cups promise to marry shelf life with circularity. Packaging engineers should therefore collaborate early with recycling-stream stakeholders to ensure that novel substrates are recognized by U.S. material recovery facilities, safeguarding claims and avoiding greenwashing accusations that can erode parental trust.

Amazon reigns online with a 46% share of digital kids-drink dollars, but brand-owned sites are scaling: Hint Kids Water grew its subscription base 55% YOY, boasting a churn rate below 6%. Grocery curbside pickup also matters—Albertsons’ DriveUp & Go logged a 23% lift in multipack flavored waters, fueled by “buy again” one-tap algorithms that simplify replenishment for busy parents. Last-mile efficiency underlies profitability in the kids beverage market. C-store delivery via DoorDash and Gopuff accounted for 11% of single-serve juice unit sales during post-school “3 p.m. spike” windows, an untapped exposure point for trial. Cold-chain integrity tech, like Vericool’s plant-fiber insulation, maintains 34–38 °F for eight hours, expanding the viable radius for perishable smoothies. Retail media networks (RMNs) close the loop: Kroger’s DSP can target ads to households that previously bought toddler purées, then measure incremental basket lift within 48 hours—capability that convinced Danone to double RMN spend in 2024. For decision makers, marrying DTC margins with omnichannel scale demands SKU rationalization: offer flavor variety packs online where digital shelf is unlimited, yet focus brick-and-mortar slots on velocity leaders to avoid out-of-stock fines. Seamless inventory visibility, order-management systems, and in-app loyalty hooks will determine who captures the at-home convenience dollar in the next growth wave.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Threat To Hollywood Sparks More Questions Than Answers

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The Hollywood Sign seen in 2023 President Donald Trump declared Sunday night that his latest tariff target is the film industry. A post on his social network Truth Social said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” adding other countries’ incentives for filming movies—which often draw production to other shores—constitutes “a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump’s directive: Authorizing the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to “begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Most people involved in the entertainment industry responded the same way: With a big question mark. It’s not clear what Trump is targeting: Films for U.S. audiences shot on location elsewhere? Foreign films with global distribution, like South Korea’s Parasite, the 2020 Best Picture Oscar winner? And are these just films for theatrical release or would it include movies and series made for streaming networks? Where and how would this tariff be applied? If enacted, this kind of tariff could deeply impact the film industry. Many of the last decade’s top grossing movies were made outside of the U.S. Investors sharply pulled back as markets opened on Monday, with Netflix initially seeing its stock drop 4% and losing $20.4 billion market capitalization—almost the total current value of Warner Bros. Discovery. The stock market closed with smaller losses for Netflix and other entertainment companies, including Disney and Paramount Global, but no more clarity on these potential tariffs from the White House. Not often one to agree with Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom entered the discussion Monday with his own proposal: The state would collaborate with the federal government to enact a $7.5 billion incentive program to help domestic movie production. It’s unclear if the White House will discuss the matter with Newsom. On Monday, Trump called Newsom a “grossly incompetent governor that allowed” the movie business to go to other countries. And it also remains to be seen if this proposal will advance. (After all, the Truth Social post that started the discussion was made half an hour after Trump used the social media platform to endorse reopening San Francisco’s Alcatraz as a federal prison, which got this response from Newsom to CBS Sacramento: “You can’t even come up with a more colossally bad fiscal idea.”) What it does show are two different approaches to the common goal of building domestic industry. Trump is reaching for tariffs, while Newsom is proposing incentives. Each has benefits and drawbacks, not least of which is the immediate response from industry and investors. How the issue plays out—if at all—will show the way policy and business intermingle, and what truly works today. Protecting data and advancing cybersecurity isn’t just the CIO’s responsibility, especially given how vital that information is to making future projections—and how costly data breaches can be. I talked to Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, about how CFOs and CIOs can come together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader looks at different stock indexes on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the ... More opening bell in New York City, on May 6, 2025. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Pedestrians walk past the American lifestyle and performance footwear brand Skechers store in Hong ... More Kong. Skechers, the U.S.’s third-largest footwear company by sales, will be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital in a deal worth $9.4 billion. The deal will take the publicly traded company private, and is expected to close later this year. CEO and cofounder Robert Greenberg will remain in that role and continue to lead the company’s strategy, but he and his family will make $1.1 billion on the sale, writes Forbes’ Jemima McEvoy and Matt Durot. Last week, as part of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, Skechers signed a letter to Trump saying that tariffs posed an “existential threat” to the footwear industry, arguing that U.S. consumers would be unable to bear increased costs for shoes and that tens of thousands of industry jobs were on the line. A source close to the deal told CNBC that the timing and nature of the acquisition have nothing to do with tariffs and the current situation; 3G Capital has had its eye on Skechers as an acquisition target for some time. A sign outside of IRS headquarters in Washington, DC. The Trump Administration’s deep cuts to federal government employees have removed 11% of the workforce at the IRS so far, according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. The cuts are not spread evenly across the agency. Nearly a third of all revenue agents—usually CPAs who audit tax returns—who were there in January have been cut. About 18% of revenue officers, who focus on collections, are no longer there. About half of employees who are no longer at the IRS worked with small businesses and self-employed entities. Springline Advisory CTO Abhesh Kumar In today’s business world, data and cybersecurity threats are always multiplying. Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, sees one way to strengthen both a company’s use and understanding of data and its security: Having finance and data or technology leaders work together on it. I talked to him about why this is an important partnership and how to make it work. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What can help fill gaps in knowledge about data between CFOs and CIOs? Kumar: Both CTOs and CFOs need to take joint ownership as stewards of data assets. While technology [departments have] always taken the role of protecting all the data, in forward-leaning organizations such as Springline, CFOs are now embedding cybersecurity and data protection as part of their financial risk management. This is now getting recognized that the reputational risk, the compliance risk, and, frankly, the financial risk that could arise out of a lack of data protection could greatly cross even some of the more traditional forms of risk. This awareness comes back to the CTO or CIO and CFO working very closely and collaboratively as joint stakeholders in data protection and vulnerability management. There’s a cultural angle to it. Often CTOs and CFOs exist in siloed worlds. Leading by example and making joint appearances at the board level, where you’re seen as co-equal stakeholders in being the stewards of managing the protection of data assets, also drives a behavior down the chain of working in tandem and building that cohesion, which eventually reduces the blind spots for everybody. Some of the other things from a practical perspective will be proactive monitoring of threats and a proactive approach toward training and developing skill: Anti-phishing training, anti-social engineering trainings, deploying cybersecurity not as a one-off measure but embedding it into your business processes so that you are designing the system with cybersecurity at the front-and-center of your approach. With increased communication and collaboration, the chances of security being seen as a trade off between collaboration or innovation starts to blur, and a middle part starts to emerge where you can actually have the best of both words. You can be fairly agile and nimble in your business processes without really compromising or taking on non-compliance risk. A recent study from KPMG looking at the dynamic between CFOs and CIOs found that they both claim ownership of things dealing with data and tech, but have different viewpoints on what it’s for and why they’re doing it. Do you see this kind of difference of perception as an impediment to working together? I do not necessarily see it as an impediment. I actually see it as an opportunity to bring two diverse points of view together on a problem that will have collective impact on both stakeholders. The CFO and the CTO, it’s given that they have slightly different KPIs. Once they double-click and triple-click on some of the approaches towards protecting data assets, they will realize there’s rich and fertile ground for collaboration in elevating the data protection together. Technology risk can manifest itself in financial risk and damage, and financial risk can certainly bring down the technology pillar of the organization. I see it as a shared interest—even though both parties bring different points of view, but also different strengths and motivations to essentially do the right thing for the organization as a whole. That’s how I see it as an opportunity for collaboration. In fact, it’s all the more reason they should be collaborating, because the impact is greater on the whole than individuals. What advice would you give to a CFO to start working with their CIO or CTO in this manner? First, convince yourself that this is important, and talk to your CTO. Build that awareness of what the lack of good cybersecurity or data security procedures translates into dollar terms. CFOs understand dollar terms very clearly, and CTOs have to step up and be able to translate that risk. This is part of that collaboration: They need to make it easy for the CFO to understand because it is not just the loss of data. It’s the value of that data, plus reputational risk, compliance risk, disclosure risk for your clients. The CFO must understand the actual dollar impact of this risk, and then lead by example. CFO could be seen as a champion of cybersecurity by taking on an executive sponsor role for some of these defense mechanisms like training. That sends a message across the organization that this is something at the very senior level that’s being taken by the CFO. In return, the CFO gets enhanced security, enhanced visibility of the data and a close partnership with the technology department that protects their crown jewels. Legendary Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett unexpectedly announced over the weekend he would be stepping back from leading the firm at the end of the year, and plans to hand the company’s reins to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel. 1965: Year Buffett became Berkshire’s CEO 19.9%: Berkshire’s compounded annual gain from 1965 to 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500’s 10.4% annual return ‘Just keep making the most of it’: Buffett’s advice to Berkshire shareholders, telling them they are already fortunate to be part of the U.S. It’s National Small Business Week, and this size of enterprise has many financial rules and regulations to comply with. In this week’s Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter, senior writer Kelly Phillips Erb goes over what small businesses need to know, and where they can learn more and get advice. If used properly, AI can make you a better leader and take on tasks ranging from complex analytical calculations to improving communication with employees. Here are some ways it can help many aspects of your business leadership. Which health insurance company announced last week it was leaving the Obamacare individual coverage business next year? A.

Title: Trump's tariffs are scrambling businesses' ability to predict what happens next

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump’s tariffs rollout is frustrating U.S. companies’ planning for the rest of the year, preventing some corporate giants from telling investors what to expect and scrambling the broader outlook for stocks. Mattel and Ford each suspended their 2025 financial forecasts on Monday. The toy giant told investors that “given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel’s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.” The company said that Barbie and Hot Wheels, its two flagship brands, were mostly manufactured outside of China, which faces a 145% effective tariff rate from the Trump administration. Still, CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning that Mattel was considering hiking prices for U.S. consumers to offset the costs of tariffs, which it estimated could come to about $270 million. “Where necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.,” Kreiz said. Mattel shares have declined by about 25% since February, when Trump first began discussing tariffs in greater detail. By comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell about 8% over the same period. “The shape of the toy industry has really changed,” said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel, who noted that Mattel’s products are increasingly sold in big-box retailers that are vulnerable to supply-chain snarls. The company said during its earnings call that it was prepared to increase direct imports to help stores keep shelves stocked. “Could we spin up more U.S.-based production? Yes. Will it be in the next five to 10 years? Probably not,” Benway said. Ford, too, put its outlook for the year on hold this week, citing lack of clarity about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, as well as how consumers may react to price increases. It joined other automakers including Dodge and Ram maker Stellantis, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz in pulling its annual guidance. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned the company’s hit from tariffs would be “huge.” Ford builds several models in Mexico that are sold in the U.S., including the popular electric Mustang Mach-E, Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport. Trump has softened his stance on tariffs somewhat, but so far no trade deals have materialized. That has left large and small companies alike facing tremendous uncertainty over how much the trade duties could hit their bottom lines. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to downplay the potential impact to consumers from tariffs despite campaigning on immediate economic relief. He told NBC News’ Kristen Welker on Sunday that Americans should in some cases be making do with less. “I’m just saying [Americans] don’t need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,” he said. “They don’t need to have 250 pencils,” he said. “They can have five.” Other companies are issuing multiple forecasts that take into account different economic scenarios. United Airlines said last month that “a single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company’s expectation has become bimodal — either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession.” Most other major airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, also either warned of lower earnings or suspended some guidance. Even some tech companies, many of which were thought to be largely immune from tariffs, signaled they could no longer forecast near-term financial results. That includes Snapchat parent Snap, which declined to issue guidance for the second quarter. But so far, stock investors have been relatively sanguine about the growing chorus of companies admitting they cannot navigate the current environment. Last week, the S&P 500 returned to the level it had reached before Trump gave his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2, after suffering weeks of heavy losses, though the index ended Monday in the red and was off to a rough start again Tuesday. “This is a tricky time for investors,” Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent note to clients. “While the economy has held up a touch better than expected so far, it’s very early.” All things considered, he said, the recent rally is likely to dissipate in the face of what are likely to be “significant price hikes, supply chain disruptions, and job losses.” Other major companies reporting earnings this week include Disney, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, Warner Bros. Discovery and Uber. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. J.J.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China returned from holiday refreshed and in good spirits (similar to how I feel post-vacation), and Indonesia outperformed while Thailand underperformed. Japan was closed for Greenery Day, a holiday “dedicated to appreciating nature and expressing gratitude for its blessings.” South Korea was closed for Vesak Day, which is also Buddha’s Birthday. Hong Kong and Mainland China were driven higher by green shoots in U.S.-China trade talks last Friday and over the weekend, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s positive comments yesterday. Asian currencies have made monster moves versus the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan dollar is up +7.29% and the offshore CNY (CNH) is up +0.96% since April 28. The Chinese people were on the move during the May Day holiday, with 101.7 million railway passengers and 11.15 million airline passengers, while 10.896 million foreigners visited China, according to Mainland media sources. According to the South China Morning Post, people opened their wallets, with 60,000 auto trade-in subsidy applications. Meanwhile, home appliance sales during the holiday were up +15.5% year-over-year, auto sales were up +13.7% YoY, communication equipment sales were up+10.5% YoY, and home and apartment sales data appear strong in the top 30 major cities. The April Caixin Services PMI was 50.7 versus expectations of 51.8 and March’s 51.9 as the month-over-month indicator declines from tariff front running. Hong Kong soft technology (internet), airlines, hotels, restaurants, and Macau casino stocks outperformed overnight. Hardware technology stocks, including biotechnology, and semiconductors, underperformed, led by index heavyweight Xiaomi, which was down -2.92%. Mainland investors bought a healthy $1.7 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs today as Meituan and Alibaba saw an inflow, while Tencent saw a small outflow. From a breadth perspective, Mainland China had a very strong day led by growth stocks, with 4,677 advancing stocks and only 396 declining stocks. Unlike Hong Kong, hard technology stocks had a very strong day, led by electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and travel and consumer plays, such as airlines. Hopefully, the positive momentum continues! Investor’s Business Daily had an insightful article over the weekend titled, “The Trade War Comes Ashore,” providing a timeline of the coming tariff tsunami effect on store shelves and retail employment. Maritime consulting firm Drewry anticipates 2025 cargo volumes will decline for only the third time since 1979. The only two declines were the 2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Apollo Global Management believes that domestic freight and retail companies will begin layoffs by early June as “most retailers will have run through their stockpiled inventory.” Companies anticipating inventory issues mentioned in the article include Amazon, Target, and Walmart, though the list is far more expansive. Even if the U.S. and China governments make significant progress over the next few weeks, the American people will likely discover how reliant and intertwined our two economies are. I suspect most Americans don’t want their kids working in low-end manufacturing versus high-end manufacturing and innovation industries (brain versus brawn industries). Obviously, there are things that should be made here in the U.S. for national security reasons, but the vast majority of what is made in China and Asia more broadly and sold in U.S. stores doesn’t fit that criteria. Ultimately, not even politicians can overpower economic laws, just as President Hoover and Senators Smoot and Hawley learned nearly a century ago.

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy a second time

Time Published: 2025-05-06T13:56:17Z

Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating, and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

Title: Hollywood is the latest industry to get skittish about Trump's tariffs

Good morning! Some of the world's elite gathered for the Met Gala last night. (My invite must have got lost in the mail.) Here's a rundown on how the event went. We also made our picks for who was the best-dressed — and who missed the mark. In today's big story, President Donald Trump has targeted movies made outside the US with his latest tariffs, but no one really knows what it means. I know your inbox is already pretty full, but you're going to want to make room for this. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr on what's happening at the world's most powerful tech companies, is launching soon. Subscribe here! What's on deck Markets: Warren Buffett's retirement announcement was a downer for Berkshire Hathaway's stock. Tech: Former Meta employees shared what it was like to be laid off as "low performers." Business: Austin is the first battleground for Tesla and Waymo's driverless taxis to face off. But first, lights! Cameras! Tariffs! If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. EXT: PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY - DAY A walking film reel departs from a European container ship and approaches a customs officer awaiting exiting passengers. FILM REEL Hello! I'm the new summer blockbuster, and I'm ready for the big screen! CUSTOMS AGENT Not until you pay up on these tariffs! My first attempt at screenwriting might not make sense, but the same could be said for President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcement focused on Hollywood. On Sunday, the president said he'd save Hollywood from "dying a very fast death" due to productions shifting out of the country by imposing a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. The problem, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka points out in this piece, is that no one quite understands what putting tariffs on films made outside the US means or how it would work. Trump isn't wrong that tax incentives and labor costs have led Hollywood to look overseas. But how would one enforce these tariffs? What level of work done on a movie outside the US would trigger the tariffs? And, as my short film above illustrates, how do you even tariff something that doesn't physically arrive here via cargo ships or planes? (You can read more about Peter's theories here. Hint: Tax breaks and other financial incentives.) Trump said Monday afternoon he was "not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help." What's not debatable was the industry's initial reaction. Shares of top streamers and movie companies like Netflix and Walt Disney took a dip Monday morning. Maybe the best way to understand these latest tariffs is to look at them more holistically. At least, that was the pitch from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday at the Milken conference, where BI's Bradley Saacks was in attendance. In front of a crowd of the world's biggest and most powerful asset managers, Bessent made the case that the administration's overall trade plans were part of a three-pronged approach. Tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation work together "to solidify our position as the home of global capital," Bessent told the group. The framing was meant to help investors digest the volatile first 100 days of Trump's presidency, thanks largely to his focus on tariffs. Carlyle CEO Harvey Schwartz and Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, who followed Bessent's speech, said tying together tariffs with deregulation and tax cuts was a good way to articulate Trump's broader plan. Whether the rest of the attendees agreed remains to be seen. 1. It's time to start rooting for the rich. The wealthy don't like higher prices, but they're spending through it. Their buying habits are holding up the consumer-driven US economy — but if they start to cut back, everyone else will feel the contraction. 2. Berkshire Hathaway's stock tumbles on Buffett news. The conglomerate's stock dropped as much as 7% on Monday after Warren Buffett announced his retirement over the weekend. Shareholders are wondering what Berkshire will look like without Buffett at the helm. 3. Elite colleges are rushing to the bond market. MIT plans to sell $750 million worth of taxable bonds, according to May 2 preliminary offering documents. It joins a list of elite colleges that have tapped the bond market as the Trump administration threatens to slash federal funding for universities. 1. Meta's "low performers" on those brutal layoffs. Eight former employees told BI what it was like to be caught in the company's sweeping job cuts — and the stigma that comes with being labeled a "low performer." 2. Amazon rewards consistently high performers. The retail giant is revamping its pay structure to better recognize and reward long-term high performers, per internal guidelines obtained by BI. The compensation overhaul reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 3. Microsoft's controversial management approach. The software giant is putting some ousted low performers on a two-year rehiring ban and identifies these job cuts as "good attrition," according to an internal document viewed by BI. It's similar to hardcore performance-management strategies used at Meta and Amazon. 1. Tesla vs. Waymo. The two companies' driverless taxis will go head-to-head in Austin in June, when Tesla launches its services in the city. Here's how the robotaxis compare on cost, training, business strategy, and more. 2. OpenAI says its nonprofit will remain in control after all. In September, the AI giant announced it was moving to a for-profit business model. Read the letter CEO Sam Altman sent to employees explaining the decision to reverse course. 3. Google wants the star power. The tech company quietly launched a film and TV production initiative called 100 Zeros, BI has learned. Google hopes 100 Zeros will boost its image among Gen Z, but it plans to skip out on YouTube as a distributor. President Trump hosts Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House.

Business U.S. meal delivery firm DoorDash will buy Deliveroo in a deal valuing the British rival at about 2.9 billion pounds ($3.85 billion), the companies said, banking on a bigger reach and local expertise to take on competition. Separately on Tuesday, DoorDash said it would buy SevenRooms, a New York City-based hospitality-related software company, for about $1.2 billion. The company's spending spree comes at a time when similar businesses have struggled to add scale with consumers being mindful about spending on pricey food delivery services. Both the companies rekindled talks last month after DoorDash approached Deliveroo with a 180 pence per share proposal, which was confirmed on Tuesday as the final offer, sending Deliveroo shares up about 2 per cent.

Large AI Overviews on SERPs are affecting visibility and causing a dramatic decrease in traffic. Effective faceted navigation can support SEO – if implemented correctly. Learn how to avoid index bloat, crawl issues, and ranking setbacks. This week’s question tackles the potential SEO fallouts when implementing faceted navigation: “How can ecommerce sites implement SEO-friendly faceted navigation without hurting crawl efficiency or creating index bloat?” Faceted navigation is a game-changer for user experience (UX) on large ecommerce sites. It helps users quickly narrow down what they’re looking for, whether it’s a size 8 pair of red road running trainers for women, or a blue, waterproof winter hiking jacket for men. For your customers, faceted navigation makes huge inventories feel manageable and, when done right, enhances both UX and SEO. However, when these facets create a new URL for every possible filter combination, they can lead to significant SEO issues that harm your rankings, and waste valuable crawl budget if not managed properly. Faceted navigation issues often fly under the radar – until they start causing real SEO damage. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to spot the early warning signs. With the right tools and a bit of detective work, you can uncover whether filters are bloating your site, wasting crawl budget, or diluting rankings. Here’s a step-by-step approach to auditing your site for faceted SEO issues: Start by searching on Google with this query: site:yourdomain.com. This will show you all the URLs Google has indexed for your site. Review the list: If so, you may have index bloat. Check Google Search Console (GSC) for a clearer picture. Look under “Coverage” to see how many pages are indexed. Pay attention to the “Indexed, not submitted in sitemap” section for unintended filter-generated pages. Not all faceted navigation behaves the same. Make sure you understand how filters work on your site: Some faceted pages drive traffic; others burn crawl budget without returns. Use tools like Botify, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs to compare Googlebot’s crawling behavior with actual organic visits. If a page gets crawled a lot but doesn’t attract visitors, it’s a sign that it’s consuming crawl resources unnecessarily. Run a crawler to scan your site’s URLs. Check for repetitive patterns, such as endless combinations of parameters like ?price=low&sort=best-sellers. These are potential crawler traps and unnecessary variations. To decide which SEO tactics to use for faceted navigation, assess the search demand for specific filters and whether unique content can be created for those variations. Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to check for user demand for specific filter combinations. For example: This helps prioritize which facet combinations should be indexed. If there’s enough value in targeting a specific query, such as product features, a dedicated URL may be worthwhile. However, low-value filters like price or size should remain no-indexed to avoid bloated indexing. The decision should balance the effort needed to create new URLs against the potential SEO benefits. Log files record every request, including those from search engine bots. By analyzing them, you can track which URLs Googlebot is crawling and how often, helping you identify wasted crawl budget on low-value pages. For example, if Googlebot is repeatedly crawling deep-filtered URLs like /jackets?size=large&brand=ASICS&price=100-200&page=12 with little traffic, that’s a red flag. Key signs of inefficiency include: By regularly checking your logs, you get a clear picture of Googlebot’s behavior, enabling you to optimize crawl budget and focus Googlebot’s attention on more valuable pages. Here’s how to keep things under control, so your site stays crawl-efficient and search-friendly. Start with the basics: Your facet labels should be intuitive. “Blue,” “Leather,” “Under £200” – these need to make instant sense to your users. Confusing or overly technical terms can lead to a frustrating experience and missed conversions. Not sure what resonates? Check out competitor sites and see how they’re labeling similar filters. Just because you can add 30 different filters doesn’t mean you should. Too many options can overwhelm users and generate thousands of unnecessary URL combinations. Stick to what genuinely helps customers narrow down their search. If your platform allows it, use clean, readable URLs for facets like /sofas/blue rather than messy query strings like ?color[blue]. Reserve query parameters for optional filters (e.g., sort order or availability), and don’t index those. Use canonical tags to point similar or filtered pages back to the main category/parent page. This helps consolidate link equity and avoid duplicate content issues. Just remember, canonical tags are suggestions, not commands. Google may ignore them if your filtered pages appear too different or are heavily linked internally. For any faceted pages you want indexed, these should include a self-referencing canonical, and for any that don’t, canonicalize these to the parent page. Break your URLs into three clear groups: No matter the order in which users apply filters, the resulting URL should be consistent. For example, /trainers/blue/leather and /trainers/leather/blue should result in the same URL, or else you’ll end up with duplicate content that dilutes SEO value. One way to reduce unnecessary crawling is by blocking faceted URLs through your robots.txt file. That said, it’s important to know that robots.txt is more of a polite request than a strict rule. Search engines like Google typically respect it, but not all bots do, and some may interpret the syntax differently. To prevent search engines from crawling pages you don’t want indexed, it’s also smart to ensure those pages aren’t linked to internally or externally (e.g., backlinks). If search engines find value in those pages through links, they might still crawl or index them, even with a disallow rule in place. Here’s a basic example of how to block a faceted URL pattern using the robots.txt file. Suppose you want to stop crawlers from accessing URLs that include a color parameter: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* In this rule: However, if your faceted navigation requires a more nuanced approach, such as blocking most color options but allowing specific ones, you’ll need to mix Disallow and Allow rules. For instance, to block all color parameters except for “black,” your file might include: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* Allow: /*color=black* A word of caution: This strategy only works well if your URLs follow a consistent structure. Without clear patterns, it becomes harder to manage, and you risk accidentally blocking key pages or leaving unwanted URLs crawlable. If you’re working with complex URLs or an inconsistent setup, consider combining this with other techniques like meta noindex tags or parameter handling in Google Search Console. Internal links signal importance to search engines. So, if you link frequently to faceted URLs that are canonicalized or blocked, you’re sending mixed signals. Consider using rel=”nofollow” on links you don’t want crawled – but be cautious. Google treats nofollow as a hint, not a rule, so results may vary. Point to only canonical URLs within your website wherever possible. This includes dropping parameters and slugs from links that are not necessary for your URLs to work. You should also prioritize pillar pages; the more inlinks a page has, the more authoritative search engines will deem that page to be. In 2019, Google’s John Mueller said: “In general, we ignore everything after hash… So things like links to the site and the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold up into the non hash URL.” Track which filters users actually engage with, and which lead to conversions. If no one ever uses the “beige” filter, it may not deserve crawlable status. Use tools like Google Analytics 4 or Hotjar to see what users care about and streamline your navigation accordingly. When a filtered page returns no results, respond with a 404 status, unless it’s a temporary out-of-stock issue, in which case show a friendly message stating so, and return a 200. This helps avoid wasting crawl budget on thin content. When you interact with a page – say, filtering a product list, selecting a color, or typing in a live search box – AJAX lets the site fetch or send data behind the scenes, so the rest of the page stays put. It can be really effective to implement facets client-side via AJAX, which doesn’t create multiple URLs for every filter change. This reduces unnecessary load on the server and improves performance. Faceted navigation often leads to large sets of results, which naturally introduces pagination (e.g., ?category=shoes&page=2). But when combined with layered filters, these paginated URLs can balloon into thousands of crawlable variations. Left unchecked, this can create serious crawl and index bloat, wasting search engine resources on near-duplicate pages. So, should paginated URLs be indexed? In most cases, no. Pages beyond the first page rarely offer unique value or attract meaningful traffic, so it’s best to prevent them from being indexed while still allowing crawlers to follow links. The standard approach here is to use noindex, follow on all pages after page 1. This ensures your deeper pagination doesn’t get indexed, but search engines can still discover products via internal links. When it comes to canonical tags, you’ve got two options depending on the content. If pages 2, 3, and so on are simply continuations of the same result set, it makes sense to canonicalize them to page 1. This consolidates ranking signals and avoids duplication. However, if each paginated page features distinct content or meaningful differences, a self-referencing canonical might be the better fit. The key is consistency – don’t mix page 2 canonical to page 1 and page 3 to itself, for example. About rel=”next” and rel=”prev,” while Google no longer uses these signals for indexing, they still offer UX benefits and remain valid HTML markup. They also help communicate page flow to accessibility tools and browsers, so there’s no harm in including them. To help control crawl depth, especially in large ecommerce sites, it’s wise to combine pagination handling with other crawl management tactics: For example, a faceted URL like /trainers?color=white&brand=asics&page=3 would typically: Handling pagination well is just as important as managing the filters themselves. It’s all part of keeping your site lean, crawlable, and search-friendly. When properly managed, faceted navigation can be an invaluable tool for improving user experience, targeting long-tail keywords, and boosting conversions. However, without the right SEO strategy in place, it can quickly turn into a crawl efficiency nightmare that damages your rankings. By following the best practices outlined above, you can enjoy all the benefits of faceted navigation while avoiding the common pitfalls that often trip up ecommerce sites.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash for £2.9bn

Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. "The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce," the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was "very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was "transformative". "The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition." The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to "squeeze out" rivals such as Just Eat and "rattle Uber" in the UK. "The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top," he added. "With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast." The takeover by a US firm shows the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms

Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z

The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears.

DoorDash has agreed to buy UK-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo for an equity value of about £2.9 billion (€3.4 billion), as the US company pushes into more overseas markets. DoorDash has offered £1.80 in cash for each Deliveroo share, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming the terms of an offer announced on April 25th. That’s a 29 per cent premium to Deliveroo’s closing share price on April 24. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. DoorDash, which controls two-thirds of the restaurant delivery market in the US, will expand its reach to more than 40 countries with the acquisition, it said. The two companies combined had a gross order value of about $90 billion last year and have a combined 50 million monthly active users. Deliveroo shares closed at £172.10 on Friday in trading in London, where markets were closed on Monday. The stock is up 21 per cent this year. DoorDash’s shares also advanced, closing at $205.40 on Monday, taking gains for the year to 22 per cent. DoorDash said that its offer is final and won’t be increased unless another bidder comes in for the UK company. Previous negotiations had ended in disagreement over Deliveroo’s valuation, Reuters reported last year. DoorDash, which provides a restaurant delivery service through a mobile application, said it would not increase its offer, but reserved a right to do so if a third party emerged with a competing offer for Deliveroo. The acquisition will help Doordash grow its market share in Europe, competing against Just Eat and Uber Eats. Britain and Ireland are Deliveroo’s largest market, accounting for 62% of the value of its orders in its latest quarter. Deliveroo’s directors, including chief executive officer Will Shu, have agreed to offer their shares in the deal, and DoorDash said it has agreements from investors representing 15.4 per cent of the stock so far. The deal needs the approval of owners representing 75 per cent of Deliveroo’s shares. The proposal is the latest example of consolidation in the industry, after Prosus in February agreed to buy Amsterdam’s Just Eat Takeaway. Food delivery companies are being pushed to combine after rapid acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic lost steam in the years following. A new generation of global players with deep pockets are now competing for customers across borders. Deliveroo shares dropped in March after projecting earnings that fell far below analysts’ estimates, and the company exited the Hong Kong market, following disappointing sales and mounting competition. - Reporting: Bloomberg/Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: WPP Prepares to Kill Off GroupM Name to Make Way for WPP Media

WPP is set to retire its GroupM brand, which houses its media agencies, renaming it WPP Media, per several industry reports. ADWEEK also learned of the decision to sunset the 20-year-old name from a source with knowledge of the matter. A WPP spokesperson told ADWEEK: “We don’t comment on speculation.” Switching out the 20-year-old name is set to occur before summer, and follows what WPP chief executive (CEO) Mark Read described in the company’s annual report as a “year of transition” for the media investment division under new CEO Brian Lesser, who joined in September 2024. GroupM employs around 40,000 people, more than a third of WPP’s total global workforce. Ad Age reported that there will be layoffs as part of the process, related to the consolidation of individual media agency teams. WPP declined to comment on any reduction in staff. Just now, GroupM operates with a core group of four global agencies: Mindshare, Wavemaker, EssenceMediacom, and T&Pm. It also offers cross-channel performance via GroupM Nexus, data solutions through Choreograph, and entertainment services via GroupM Motion Entertainment. Per WPP’s website, GroupM manages $63 billion worth of media budgets. Major clients include Amazon and Unilever. Coca-Cola is also a key account, however WPP recently lost the soda giant’s North American media business to rival Publicis Groupe. Lesser revamped GroupM’s leadership restructure in January 2025, axing global CEO positions for individual agencies and naming McKinsey & Company’s Emily Del Greco global chief operating officer (COO). Read recently told ADWEEK that GroupM was a key player in WPP’s turnaround plan as it posted a 5% Q1 2025 revenue dip amid ongoing financial struggles. Year-on-year revenue declined at GroupM for the quarter too, with growth in the U.S. offset by client losses from “previous years” and weakness in China. “At its best, GroupM is extremely competitive. We just need to make sure they’re on their best every day of the week,” Read said at the end of April. Mark Read is Still Banking on a GroupM Turnaround The CEO’s six-year tenure at WPP has been marked by consolidation to cut operating costs. One big change on the creative side involved bringing together VML and Y&R with Wunderman Thomson under the VML brand. On the media side, Read merged digital media agency Essence and media buying firm Mediacom to form EssenceMediacom. He also merged five of WPP’s branding and design agencies into Superunion, which was then combined with Design Bridge to create Design Bridge and Partners. Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

Title: Cisco, UPS, other companies adjusting workforce as they embrace AI: report

Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins discusses denied healthcare claims and overturned rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Some companies have been adjusting their workforce as they simultaneously embrace artificial intelligence and automation more, according to Forbes. The outlet reported over the weekend that Duolingo, UPS, Klarna, Cisco and Inuit are among some of the firms that have demonstrated that trend. Duolingo recently said it was striving to be "AI-first," with CEO Luis von Ahn outlining various measures that it will take to help accomplish that in a publicly available company-wide message, per Forbes. (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Von Ahn said in the message that Duolingo will "gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle" and that headcount "will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work." When hiring and doing performance reviews, people’s abilities to use AI will also be part of what the company considers, according to the message. DUOLINGO ANNOUNCES 148 COURSES CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING SOON ON PLATFORM The CEO said the "AI-first" moves focused on "removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we have" rather than "replacing Duos with AI." At UPS, some 20,000 employees are getting the ax, the company announced in late April. Forbes reported that UPS said AI wasn’t directly taking the place of employees, but the company is working to increase its efficiency through more automation and AI tools, something that the outlet said helped with shrinking its labor demands. UPS and Amazon, its largest customer, agreed in January that the e-commerce giant would reduce its package volume with UPS by more than 50%. Klarna has been leaning into AI more in recent years, using it for customer service, transaction processing and other functions, according to Forbes. (Jonas Walzberg/picture alliance via Getty Images) CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said in the past that certain human work functions can be done by AI, the outlet reported. In February last year, the company said that an AI chatbot it launched was capable of doing the work of 700 full-time agents. AI has enabled Klarna to have a smaller workforce, according to Forbes. Last fall, Cisco Systems embarked on a restructuring so it could invest in AI, cybersecurity and other growth areas, the outlet reported. When announcing the restructuring, the company also said in an SEC filing the move would "drive more efficiencies in its business." AI ENERGY DEMAND IN US WILL SURGE BUT ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE ENERGY Roughly 7% of the company’s workers lost their jobs as part of the restructuring. Cisco has been putting artificial intelligence into network management and customer support systems, Forbes reported. Meanwhile, Intuit announced layoffs of 1,800 workers in July last year as part of a reorganization to boost its investments in artificial intelligence, according to the outlet. CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the reorganization would "enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth," per a company-wide email that the company included in an SEC filing at the time. The company identified AI-powered tools it offers as some of the initiatives that it wanted to put more money into, Forbes reported. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File) At the same time, Goodarzi said Intuit would hire 1,800 new people "primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles" to support its growth areas. A MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI started seeing a major increase in uptake in the wake of OpenAI releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, spurring major investments and innovations in the sector.

Title: Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Trump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down China vowed this week it would "never kneel down" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, "essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased," said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects "empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks" and "Covid-like shortages for consumers." That slowdown, Slok said, would result in "significant" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate "substantial" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. "Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst," China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video. A report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "hostile and political act." The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and "was never approved." Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and "solved the problem very quickly," praising him as a "good guy" who "did the right thing." Trump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a "short term" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately "slaughter" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. "China probably will eat those tariffs," he said. "Everything's going to be just fine." Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

"Economic mayhem is setting in" thanks to Trump's "crackpot tariff ideas," said the Houston Chronicle. The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. "It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them." Amazon should have stuck with its "brilliant tariff idea," saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but "instead of owning its policy," the White House "bullied Amazon to keep quiet." What is Trump afraid of? Small businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've "been stunned into paralysis" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then "disappeared overnight," and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. Consumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But "boatloads of pain" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs "might steal Christmas," said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production "has ground to a halt," and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months. Trump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic "golden age." Instead, his "chaotic" tariffs are "shaking the foundations" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden "overhang." But "every American" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com "We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations," said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, "until it didn't." Right now, "the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis," the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, "the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus." Trump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly "inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment." Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is "more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war." And the Chinese have "tools at hand to hit America's economy where it hurts, including the withholding of critical minerals and key inputs to America's industrial value chains." In short, "Beijing believes time is on its side," so if there's going to be a retreat in the trade war, "it will need to come from Trump."

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy — again | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Time Published: 2025-05-05T20:26:06Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is being estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone that cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs any time soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Netflix stock was supposed to be safe from the trade war. Then Trump talked movie tariffs

Netflix (NFLX) was supposed to get its happily ever after: Its stock had been skyrocketing, and Wall Street largely saw it as a recession-proof play amid swirling macroeconomic concerns. But that all changed with one social media post from President Donald Trump, in which he announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the U.S. The president wrote Sunday night on his Truth Media social platform that the “Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.” Trump claimed that other countries are offering incentives to studios outside the country, which is “a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” He finished the post: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded on X, saying, “We’re on it.” As of now, there are no details on how this plan will be implemented or what will be included in these tariffs. Netflix’s stock price fell almost 3.7% between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. It’s since risen some throughout the day, but it’s still down about 1.3% as of midday. This sudden fall marks a stark reversal from late April, when a bullish analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” Other entertainment companies have seen somewhat similar dips following Trump’s social media post. Paramount’s (PARA) stock is down 0.7%, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is down 0.6%, and Lions Gate (LGF.A) is a big loser on the day, down 5.4% as of early Monday afternoon. Disney’s (DIS) stock fell but has since recovered its earlier losses, up 0.1%, similar to Comcast (CMCSA), which was up 0.4%. Key details of the president’s plan remain unclear, including whether the tariff would apply only to theatrical releases or also to streaming content, how it would be calculated — by production budget or box office revenue — and whether it would affect TV shows or already-completed films. Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet told The Wrap that, in a worst-case scenario, Netflix could face a 20% decline in earnings and an annual cost increase of $3 billion. He said, however, that the actual impact is likely to be significantly lower. According to Citigroup’s analysis, the streaming platform currently spends about $17 billion per year on content, with 60% of that being original productions and the remaining 40% licensed. Of the original content, half is produced outside the U.S. Based on these figures, a 100% tariff on movies could reduce earnings per share by 20%, or approximately six cents. And that cost could be passed on to Netflix’s consumers. “If we assume U.S. production costs are 35% higher than non-U.S. costs, it’s akin to a $1 billion increase in annual costs,” Bazinet said. “If this cost is borne by U.S. consumers, it would cause [average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada] to rise about 7%.” Trump addressed his planned movie tariffs in front of reporters later Sunday after returning from Mar-a-Lago. He said, “I’ve done some very strong research over the past week, and we’re making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now, you have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I’m not just blaming other nations, but other nations have stolen our movie industry.” Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state’s tax incentives to better compete with other locations. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most-preferred place to film in the next couple of years, behind Toronto, the U.K, Vancouver, Central Europe, and Australia. When speaking to reporters, Trump also accused other countries of stealing America’s “moviemaking capabilities” and said their financial support for Hollywood films was “sort of a threat to our country in a sense.” In January, Trump named Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson as “special ambassadors” to bring a “troubled” Hollywood back “bigger, better and stronger than ever before.” Sources told Variety that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, have been taking meetings with various guilds to advise the president on how to reinvigorate filming in the U.S. Under Trump’s proposal, nearly all of this year’s major blockbusters would have been affected, including the top-grossing Minecraft Movie, filmed in New Zealand, and Captain America: Brave New World, which was shot across multiple countries, including the U.S. Coming releases such as Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning and the John Wick spin-off Ballerina would also feel the weight of the president’s tariffs. Gibson, meanwhile, has been planning to shoot his Passion of the Christ sequel in Italy. “I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),” Scott Roxborough, the Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter, told Reuters. On Monday, the British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the British government to “move swiftly to defend this vital sector ... as a matter of essential national economic interest.” Officials in Australia and New Zealand also responded to Trump’s proposed movie tariffs by pledging support for their local sectors, which have become key global filming hubs — Marvel movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was home to The Lord of the Rings franchise. So will we see the third Dune movie filmed in New Mexico and the next Mission Impossible installment in South Dakota? For now, the only certainty is uncertainty — and a growing sense that Netflix’s “safe” status in a trade war may have been a Hollywood fantasy all along.

Title: Weighing The Positives Of Fully Remote Workplaces

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. As technology continues to define business opportunities, there are basic needs that are integral to every development. Last week, I attended a panel at Honeywell’s Future of Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., at which top industry and policy leaders discussed two: energy and AI. Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry at Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, said that AI is becoming as ubiquitous among businesses as energy. “Would you ever ask a business owner if they use math?” Crahan asked. Gordon Bitko, IT Industry Council executive vice president of policy, said energy and AI are inextricably linked. “AI uses a lot of power, so the answer is: Let’s use more AI to figure out how to use less energy,” Bitko said. Industry has used AI technology for years to determine ways to be more efficient, so this sounds like a paradox. AI is being used to create hardware that can process data better, and it only makes sense to use AI to determine the best ways to generate power, optimize workloads and automate data centers. Crahan’s project is building an AI-powered, unified platform for the electric grid. Crahan said Tapestry is essentially creating “Google Maps for electrons” to figure out and predict what’s happening throughout the grid. And the rise of AI— which she called a wonderful tool for helping solve extremely complex problems with data—is coming at the perfect time. But while AI can find solutions, it comes back to the question of power. Bitko said that for AI to do its best, the U.S. needs to de-risk investment in the technologies that can improve performance and capacity for energy infrastructure, as well as get the critical materials available to build them. China has not been waiting to move forward, Bilko said, and the U.S. shouldn’t either. Crahan added that there’s another key to making quick advancements: People talking to one another and sharing their solutions. This isn’t just a matter of companies and countries talking, but also people from different parts of organizations communicating and understanding one another. “It’s really on us to take those actions forward, and that is what gives me a lot of optimism is this community is here for the change and we help each other,” Crahan said. “We want to drive change, and I think that’s really special.” Honeywell Global Regions CEO Anant Maheshwari moderated the discussion, in which Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) also participated. Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office this year, but there are still fully remote companies. I spoke with Ann Schlemmer, CEO of software company Percona, about why her employees will not be asked to report to an office anytime soon. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last Wednesday. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Warren Buffett in 2017. One of the world’s most respected CEOs unexpectedly announced over the weekend that he would step down at the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing the reins of the firm to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel, which he announced at the end of his address at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes the news surprised nearly everyone there—board members and Abel included—though the timing seems to make sense. Buffett is 94 and worth some $168 billion over the weekend, according to Forbes estimates. Buffett has been Berkshire Hathaway CEO since 1965, and the announcement of his step down received a standing ovation. Abel, a 62-year-old Canadian who’s been with Berkshire since it acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999, will have big shoes to fill. Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is an American legend for his shrewdness in investing. Even this year prior to Buffett’s announcement, Berkshire’s stock is up 19%, nearly matching its compounded annual gain of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024. Just about every company wants to improve its adoption of and expertise in AI this year, and C-suite executives are also getting into it. According to a recent survey by LinkedIn, 88% of C-suite execs say speeding AI adoption is a top priority this year. Executives are looking for their employees to become AI experts, but they aren’t forgetting themselves. C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely to add AI literacy skills to their LinkedIn profile than other professionals, and three times as many C-suite leaders have AI skills on their profiles now compared to two years ago. This isn’t to say that C-suites across the board are getting the AI skills they need. About four in 10 leaders said their top team is preventing AI adoption, citing reasons like lack of training, no change management plan, and failure to be convinced of AI’s ROI. LinkedIn and Microsoft have opened several AI skills courses, making them free of charge for several months. The time spent gaining AI skills is likely to pay off. LinkedIn found that 51% of organizations that adopted generative AI reported revenue increases of at least 10%. Percona CEO Ann Schlemmer. Open source database software company Percona has always been a fully remote company since its founding in 2006, so it was already in the swing of a distributed workforce when most of the country’s offices shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. Percona currently has just over 350 employees located in 52 countries around the globe, and CEO Ann Schlemmer says they have no intention of requiring them to work together in an office somewhere. (Percona does have a headquarters office in North Carolina, where the COO works.) I talked to Schlemmer about being an all-remote company in a world that is moving toward requiring employees to return to the office. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Why does being remote work for Percona? Schlemmer: We put a lot of work behind it. This was our intention from the very beginning: don’t let geography determine your talent. It also was a little bit of a labor arbitrage, that you could get high quality talent and maybe in lower cost centers. Trying to get all tech talent from Silicon Valley is really expensive. We have always been bootstrapped and customer-funded—we haven’t taken outside funding. That was also part of the drive: finding those areas of technical expertise globally that other people may not have found. Are you receiving more interest from potential employees now that a lot of workplaces are putting out return to office mandates? Yes. Flexibility [is a common reason] for sure. In our company, we’ve always had this mentality of being able to flex and have that flexibility as long as you get the job done. That said, not every job has flexibility. [In] some of our customer-facing roles, it’s very clear that you're expected to be available for the customers between certain hours. As a CEO, what I really care about is someone getting their job done in the time that we expect them to get it done and that they have the tools and capabilities to do that. Expectations with your colleagues on your availability would happen whether you’re remote or in person. There has to be a really high degree of trust when you are a remote worker—which also means that you need to have a high level of your own personal accountability in getting the job done, being clear on expectations and can you fulfill those expectations in that environment. With you at the helm, would you ever consider making Percona a company where people have to go into an office? I don’t see that it would ever be a whole company initiative. I could see that if there was a business case: That we had a specific team that was trying to drive new product innovation and the request was, we have the center and we want to be in person to do that, or we found that that really is the most effective. I could see that as very use-case specific. The company itself now, I wouldn't see the advantage of that. And for us in our structure, it would be a massive cost that I don’t think would give me an ROI that would make it appealing. What advice would you give to business leaders who have been much more remote since Covid and are trying to decide whether they should go back to an office? If the question is singularly return to the office or stay remote, start with what problem you are trying to solve and have clarity on that. Really large corporations have a big commercial investment that they’ve made into real estate, so, versus selling that off, they want a return on that investment. They want people coming in. And their culture and systems have been built around being in-person. That is pretty compelling. It’s a matter of defining what problem are you trying to solve, being clear on that and gaming it out to understand what are the consequences, positives, and potentially negatives of those decisions—which is what business leaders do anyway. They always have to weigh the cost of their decisions.

May 05, 2025 09:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: These 5 Red Flags Could Make You First To Be Laid Off In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You may be a liability if you have outdated skill sets. With 2025 breaking records for the most layoffs in February since the pandemic, and the highest number of tech job cuts in April, you’re probably scared that you’ll be the next one receiving a mass email or invited to a suspicious HR call. Increasing numbers of employers are adapting to the AI era, and that means implementing sweeping changes or “restructuring” across their workforce and workflows, and removing employees who don’t align with their agenda or who are costing the company too much money or lack of “efficiency,” as they often term it. Additionally, some like Intel, as reported by TechCrunch, have had lower quarterly earnings than expected, which has necessitated these employers looking across their divisions and seeing what employees are core to the business and which ones they can do without or dispense with. Frankly, when employers make these layoff decisions, there are three top criteria that they evaluate which ultimately influence the specific employees they decide to let go. In an update sent via email, General Assembly interviewed HR directors and managers in tech companies and found that the employees most likely to be let go include those who display these five red flags: It may not be what you want to hear, especially when it comes to remote work, but this is the reality. Thankfully, there are things you can do about it. If you can be replaced by AI, the odds are you will be. And if you’re not sure if your job is prone to being replaced by automation, just check out this list of 21 jobs that are bound to be obsolete by 2030 and are rapidly declining even now. So if you discover that you’re working in a job at high risk of being fully automated, then now is the time to seriously consider making a career pivot. Consider other career paths and job opportunities that leverage your transferable skills and any industry background you have which might be relevant. Think about what you have a passion in, and take time to research what jobs and new skill sets will be in high demand right now, as new job titles are created. Your skills become outdated when you’re not willing to adapt and embrace change. If you remain stuck in the same mindset since you first embarked on your job or career, you will never grow. A growth mindset acknowledges changes that are happening, and instead of ignoring them, seeks to adapt by upskilling, undertaking more professional development, seeking out new opportunities, and reflecting on one’s progress. To ensure your skills are always up to date and in high demand, check out the core skills and rising skills you need in today’s labor market based on recent data from the World Economic Forum, so you can strengthen those areas and include them in your resume. It’s a good idea to periodically check in with your manager to assess how well you’re performing against key indicators and employee standards, including company culture. Don’t just be passive and wait for your boss to inform you when it’s too late. While a good manager will inform you without needing to be asked, some won’t, so you need to be proactive and regularly gauge your performance. Come well-prepared for your one-to-one meetings with your manager. Take time to be self-aware and journal your progress in your job. Note down areas where you could do with some improvement or support, as well as areas where you find you’re exceptionally strong in, and bring these to your line manager. Ask them for support in your weak areas and see if they could recommend or signpost you to peer mentorship or other internal company resources to support your growth. Outside of your job, take time to strengthen your incompetency by undergoing extra training and courses, and attending events if necessary. Of course, there will always be times when a company catches you by surprise and lists your name along with other underperforming employees in a cop-out to cover their atrocious layoffs. You should ensure that you have accurate documentation of your progress and conversations with your manager about your performance so you can challenge this if necessary. If you work in a department that is severely defunded or not receiving due attention and allocation of resources, that’s a strong warning sign that your job is likely on the line. If not now, it will be later. Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of senior leadership dismissing specific departments or projects as not being key priorities. Review your company’s annual statement, its vision, and long-term strategies for the next three to five years. These provide strong indicators of where the company is headed, what areas leadership wants to focus on, and where new job opportunities may arise. If you sense that your role or department might be eliminated in any way, ask your manager to consider how you can progress to another department or role internally. Proactively seek to engage with cross-functional teams and projects, get your hands dirty in everything, and become well-known to several employees within the company at different levels and departments, especially those at the senior leadership level. Make yourself seen and make your presence felt across different projects. This aligns you for better opportunities within the company, so if it decides to cut a project or department, you have already jumped ship to the right place. We’ve already seen this year how thousands of federal employees have been laid off or been threatened with layoffs if they would not comply with the new in-office working stipulations imposed by the Trump administration. Amazon also began mandating all its employees to work from the office five days a week in January, and other companies have also followed. Therefore, if you work within a large company that traditionally embraces hybrid or in-person work, consider yourself a liability. Even if your role is remote right now, there may come a time where it won’t be that way forever, and you’ll be forced to either switch to working more days or hours in the office, or handing in your notice. The safest way to avoid this while continuing to hold on to your remote working status is to opt into freelancing or independent contractor work, particularly where knowledge-based work is concerned. As a freelance professional, you can work on your own terms, on your own schedule, and from whatever location you please, so long as you get the job done. While many employers view remote workers, deprioritized projects, underperformance, outdated skill sets, and automation as valid reasons to lay off their employees, you don’t need to be affected by these red flags. Now that you know what influences the decisions at the top, you can use the tips and resources to future-proof your career and maintain job stability.

Title: News Influencers Are Reaching Young People, and the Media Is Trying to Keep Up

It’s no surprise that young Americans say social media is their preferred way to get news. But a growing number of them are turning to news influencers — those familiar faces who often share frank, relatable, direct-to-camera videos — to learn about what’s going on. In 2024, a Pew Research study found that about one in five Americans (21%) — including 37% of adults under 30 — said they regularly got news from influencers. Divya Nagarajan, 19, a student at Emory University, says that seeing the same people in her feed makes them feel more trustworthy. “It's kind of like the parasocial thing where it feels like I know them,” she tells Teen Vogue. Nagarajan says she favors the conversational tone news influencers use and the personal feel of their content vs. the onslaught of breaking alerts from legacy outlets. Says Rachel Karten, a social media consultant and author of the Link in Bio newsletter, whether it's TikTok or Instagram, people don’t want to leave the platforms where they already scroll, so you have to meet them where they are: "They're not there necessarily to consume news, but if it comes across their feed, they're going to watch it," she explains. "And they're going to start to maybe grow a connection with the person who is reporting that news.” Relatability, perceived trustworthiness, ease of consumption: These are just some of the reasons young people say they’re turning to these influencer voices. Online-first news outlets like NowThis and AJ+ have long understood this; more traditional outlets, however, have only just started experimenting with what has been called “talent-driven journalism,” hiring news influencers who have a strong personal brand to lead their social presence. Influencers can be a great way to connect with new audiences, but there are concerns that social content creators could be fueling the misinformation crisis. According to Pew, 77% of these influencers have no journalism background or affiliation with a news organization, which means they may not have strict standards for vetting the information they share. The growing interest in hiring or promoting camera-ready creators with a strong personal brand is also troubling for journalists who aren’t particularly interested in being social media stars. Of course, talent-driven journalism isn’t exactly new. From familiar names in print to favorite radio hosts to iconic CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite’s comforting and constant "And that's the way it is" sign-off, people have long preferred voices they recognize. That recognition breeds trust, and it's no different on social media. So some traditional media companies are now bringing influencers in-house, or focusing on growing the followings of in-house creators, to help reach younger audiences. Mayra Báez, an audience strategist and AI consultant, helped launch AJ+, Al Jazeera’s social media news and storytelling project, in 2014, intertwining the outlet’s online brand with journalists' personal brands. In addition to making the news more engaging and approachable, Báez tells Teen Vogue via email, the move put journalists in direct conversation with audiences where they were increasingly spending time: on their phones. “Social media-first newsrooms started doing this over a decade ago; the difference is that legacy media is only now catching up, and not by choice, but out of necessity.” The Washington Post’s social media audience skews younger than its audiences on other platforms, according to the publication’s “TikTok guy” Dave Jorgenson, and audience members feel a personal connection to the account's hosts after seeing them in videos for years. “These people have been with us since they were teenagers, and we take that relationship very seriously,” he says. “We know for a fact that our audience trusts us more because of our presence on TikTok and [YouTube] Shorts.” Jorgenson, who launched the Post’s TikTok channel in 2019, recently spun off a Post-produced series, Local News International, on his personal YouTube channel. The series is designed to be cut down for vertical video and shared on the Post’s other accounts to help grow those audiences. In January, the Post doubled down on its talent-driven strategy, restructuring its public relations division to focus on developing a “star talent unit” — a move that resulted in layoffs at the outlet, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Stay up-to-date with the politics team. Sign up for the Teen Vogue Take Sara Sines, a 24-year-old dancer and performer, says she gets most of her news from influencers on social media, though the content often appears in her feed without her seeking it out. If she recognizes the face of someone whose approach she liked in the past, even if she doesn’t know their name, she stops to hear their take when they pop up on her For You page. For some publishers, social media has been the key to reaching new, younger audience members, like Sines, who may be unfamiliar with an outlet's nonsocial reporting. Morning Brew, which first launched as a business newsletter in 2015, has grown a stand-alone social media audience of millions of followers in part by leaning into creators, says Macy Gilliam, a video producer at the media company. “Young people like to follow people; they don't really like to follow brands,” she notes. "We are people at the brand, so it's kind of like bridging the gap.” Since stepping into an on-camera role two years ago, Gilliam, 24, appears every week in several short videos on Morning Brew’s social channels and has become a recognizable presence. “They'll comment things like, ‘Oh, I love when Macy does this,’ ‘Oh, Macy's always joking about that.’” This familiarity, she says, gives Morning Brew’s audience a stronger affinity for both the creator and the brand. Gilliam, who recently launched a new video franchise under the Morning Brew umbrella, believes introducing creator personalities on an outlet’s existing social channels benefits everyone: In-house influencers bring recognition, personality, and trustworthiness to the brand, creators get the company’s editorial support, and audiences get more engaging content. Talent-driven journalism does present many opportunities. But even as audience strategist Báez acknowledges the positives — news feels more personal, journalists connect directly with an audience, more accessibility, and the chance for people from underrepresented backgrounds to build their own following — she cautions that the practice also poses many challenges for journalists and news-seekers. First, Báez says, social media takes place on “borrowed land,” and is beholden to platforms with changing algorithms that generally deprioritize news. That makes it harder for outlets to ensure their coverage reaches the intended audiences, and for audiences to access the perspectives for which they’re searching. Additionally, Báez points out, not every journalist wants to be a public-facing personality. The shift toward news influencers favors extroverts over highly skilled journalists who do critical behind-the-scenes investigative work. It also increases the likelihood of harassment, burnout, and instability, especially for journalists from marginalized backgrounds. And, as with many shifts in media, this shift favors those who already have social capital, often white, male, well-connected voices, while others still struggle for visibility and support, she explains. Time will tell whether news organizations can invest in influencers to effectively benefit reporters and audiences alike. “Done right, it could strengthen journalism,” says Báez. “Done poorly, it could widen existing inequalities and destabilize an already fragile industry.”

Title: Buy Or Sell Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Earnings?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 30: U.S. President Donald Trump (L) listens as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks ... More in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on "Investing in America" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was joined by CEOs to highlight companies and their investments in the United States during the event. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent one-day (1D) post-earnings returns.

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: For GenZers working in clean energy, DOGE's cuts mean finding creative career pivots

In just four months, Aaron Yang's young career in renewable energy had hit the highs and lows you might expect of a more seasoned worker. Yang, 22, graduated from New York University in December and landed a job at the Department of Energy in an office doling out grants to nascent clean technologies like hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and long-duration battery storage. By April, he had been fired, rehired, and accepted a voluntary buyout under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the federal government. Renewable energy programs were a top target, with Trump on January 20 signing an executive order freezing funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. Since then, thousands of federal employees working on clean energy, environmental justice, and climate science have been terminated. "Throughout college, I worked toward this career path," Yang told Business Insider in April at a career fair in Washington, DC. "Then I got into the DOE and felt that was a huge achievement. So to then immediately get laid off has been tough to reconcile." Yang is among many Gen Zers entering a job market defined by hiring slumps in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. The upheaval in Washington has further clouded their career paths, particularly in the renewable energy industry, as tariffs and frozen federal funding have led companies to delay new projects or scrap them altogether. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited Friday's strong jobs report to say that Trump was bringing jobs back "and making America the world's manufacturing powerhouse once again." A DOE spokesperson told Business Insider that the department was still reviewing its organizational structure to align with the president's priorities. "The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, abundant, and secure American energy," they said, adding, "No final decisions have been made and multiple plans are still being considered." At a job fair during DC's inaugural Climate Week, more than 50 companies and trade associations met some 1,200 job seekers. They lined up to chat with firms including Amazon, the solar manufacturer Qcells, and Arcadia, an AI analytics platform for energy. Zainab Mirza organized the job fair for Clean Energy for America, a trade group that lobbies Congress and the administration on issues like protecting tax credits for renewable energy. Mirza experienced similar career setbacks as Yang. She graduated from American University in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which thwarted her plans to pursue a career in international development overseas. In February, she was laid off from the DOE's Loan Program Office, where she had just become a full-time employee after being a contractor for two years. The slashed investments go beyond the federal government. In the first three months of 2025, companies canceled, closed, or downsized projects totaling nearly $8 billion in investment. This affected 16 new factories for electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen — more than three times the cancellation rate over the previous 30 months, according to an analysis by E2, a business group that advocates for clean energy, and the think tank Atlas Public Policy. "If this self-inflicted and unnecessary market uncertainty continues, we'll almost certainly see more projects paused, more construction halted, and more job opportunities disappear," Michael Timberlake, spokesperson for E2, said in a statement. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the number of new job postings across renewable power — including solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal — dropped by more than 20%, indicating a slowdown in labor demand, an analysis Revelio Labs conducted for BI showed. Some companies continue to invest in the energy transition. In March, 10 solar, EV, and transmission manufacturing plants were announced, which, if built, could create 5,000 permanent jobs. That includes Tesla's plans to build a battery factory near Houston. Despite the hurdles, Mirza was optimistic about the future. While the DOE is expected to be less active and shift away from wind and solar projects, it may help finance nuclear, geothermal, and power grid resilience. Katie Mehnert, CEO of ALLY Energy, an online career and networking platform, said the energy industry is always changing. Mehnert lives in Texas, where layoffs are also hitting the oil and gas sector. The rise of artificial intelligence is ushering in another transformation of how businesses operate. But there will be jobs, Mehnert said. ALLY recently partnered with Parallel, an AI-driven jobs platform that aims to make job hunting more efficient and better match people's expertise to openings. "We need more energy, we need sustainable energy, we need affordable energy," Mehnert said. "And there's plenty of money that's been deployed. Now we need to find the best talent and match them with opportunities quicker. That way, we can minimize the disruption in job marketing and people's personal lives." Mirza, for her part, encouraged young people to be open-minded to positions they may not have considered. "I'm not sure where I want to go next," Mirza said. "I've had a blast putting this event together. I think that people here can meet with employers they might not have heard of or thought about, or a skill that they haven't developed. There are upskilling opportunities. There are incubators. Maybe you've had an idea for so long, and now you can test it out." Yang said he's open-minded, too. Although his time at DOE was focused on long-duration energy storage like batteries, he is open to other technologies. During his undergrad internships, Yang worked on transmission infrastructure, sales teams, and policy development. For now, Yang decided to accelerate his pursuit of a master's in energy, policy, and climate at Johns Hopkins University while looking for a full time job. He's come close several times, but ultimately, someone with more experience was hired. "That's no fault of my own," Yang said. "There are a ton of talented people out there right now, and I haven't worked full-time yet. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know what my future holds." Do you have a story to share?

Title: Market Mayhem and Recovery: Wall Street’s Wild Ride in 2025

On April 2, President Trump stunned the markets by announcing unexpectedly steep tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The reaction was swift and severe — the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 4,600 points in just four days. The sudden escalation raised fears that Trump was willing to risk a recession to reshape the global trade landscape.(Source: AP) Despite the initial crash, the U.S. stock market began to recover quickly. By early May, the S&P 500 had climbed back to the levels seen on April 2. While still over 7% below its all-time high, the market’s rapid bounce-back was just as unexpected and dramatic as the fall that preceded it. A major turning point came on April 9 when Trump announced a “90-day PAUSE” on most tariffs, excluding those targeting China. This announcement led to a massive one-day rally, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% — one of its best performances ever. However, controversy followed as Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier that day calling it a “great time to buy,” raising questions about timing and market influence. Following the pause, the market saw a mix of optimism and confusion. Trump spoke about both negotiating and enforcing tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., a seemingly contradictory stance. Still, signs of easing tensions, particularly with China, and the reduction of tariffs on cars and consumer electronics helped calm some investor nerves. The sharp stock selloff after "Liberation Day" also shook other financial markets. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, and the dollar weakened, reflecting a loss of investor confidence in America’s financial safety. Trump himself acknowledged that bond market jitters contributed to his decision to delay tariffs, as investors grew increasingly uneasy. Despite shaken consumer confidence, economic data painted a stronger picture. April saw 177,000 new jobs added, supporting the view that the economy remained resilient. The Federal Reserve, which had already cut rates three times in late 2024, chose to hold steady, watching the evolving impact of trade policy. Nonetheless, markets continue to price in the likelihood of three more cuts by year-end. Even amid uncertainty, U.S. companies have posted surprisingly strong earnings. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 firms, including giants like Microsoft and Meta, beat profit expectations, with overall earnings growth nearing 13%. However, many CEOs are hesitant about the future, offering cautious or dual forecasts — as United Airlines did — due to unpredictable trade policies. With the tariff pause nearing expiration, volatility could return swiftly if no lasting agreements are reached.

Title: The Oracle of Omaha Steps Down

After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.

His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.
