The Avalanche Foundation announced raising $250 million through a private token sale to support its blockchain platform, according to a Dec. 12 statement. The funding round had around 40 participants, including leading firms such as Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital. The announcement spurred a 10% surge in Avalanche’s AVAX token, pushing its price to $52. This continues a bullish trend, with the token gaining 52% over the past month. The Avalanche9000 upgrade, set for Dec. 16, aims to revolutionize blockchain costs and scalability. It will cut Layer-1 deployment costs on Avalanche by 99.9% and lower transaction fees on its C-Chain by 25 times. The upgrade supports Avalanche’s multi-chain vision, enabling horizontal scalability across various industries such as gaming, payments, loyalty programs, and real-world asset tokenization. Over 500 Layer-1 chains are in development, and institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leveraging Avalanche for their tokenized funds. Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, called the upgrade a transformative moment for blockchain development. He stated: “Avalanche’s upcoming Avalanche9000 upgrade represents a pivotal step toward advancing the decentralized finance ecosystem, and we believe Avalanche is uniquely positioned to capture the growing momentum in Web3 and blockchain scalability.” In preparation, the Avalanche9000 testnet introduced Retro9000, which includes a $40 million retroactive grant program. This initiative offers $2 million in referral rewards to developers building on the platform. Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder of Ava Labs, highlighted the network’s potential to outpace Ethereum, Solana, and other chains combined in transaction volume, emphasizing Avalanche’s unique multi-chain model. He stated: “There is no question in my mind that Avalanche network will process more transactions than Ethereum/L2s + Solana + other chains combined in the near future. There’s no Avalanche ‘chain.’ It’s a network of many interoperable chains. In aggregate there’s going to be a lot of activity.” At the time of press 12:55 am UTC on Dec. 13, 2024, Avalanche is ranked #11 by market cap and the price is up 9.39% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Costco is expected to post another quarter of growth against an uncertain consumer environment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is set to report its fiscal first quarter results as inflationary-weary shoppers turn to the wholesale retailer. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.81, per Bloomberg consensus estimates. Revenue is expected to come in at $62.14 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 6.26%, boosted by its international business, followed by the US and Canada. The company is projected to clock higher foot traffic in the quarter, up 6.87% compared to a year ago. But Wall Street expects transaction growth to decline 0.40%. Year to date, Costco stock is up more than 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Here's what Wall Street expects Costco to report for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to the previous year's fiscal first quarter results: Revenue: $62.14 billion versus $57.8 billion last year Adjusted earnings per share: $3.81 versus $3.58 Total company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 6.26% versus 3.9% US same-store sales growth: 6.14% versus 2.6% Canada same-store sales growth: 5.68% versus 8.2% Other international sales growth: 7.08% versus 7.1% E-commerce growth: 14.1% versus 6.3% Membership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.08 billion On Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. Wall Street expects the hike to be reflected in this quarter's results. It was the first time the company hiked its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned. As of the previous quarter, the change is expected to impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive memberships. The fee hike is expected to grow membership income by high single digits to low double digits. Membership fee income is expected to come in at $1.17 billion, more than the $1.08 billion reported last year. The company also doubled down on scanning membership cards at the door, which CEO Ron Vachris said allowed operators to know real-time foot traffic and prompt customers to renew memberships. "Membership growth remains healthy as consumers seek value and existing members continue to trade up to the Executive membership level," Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. Costco operates 891 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter. Wall Street expects that to grow to 895. Its e-commerce business is also expected to have another stellar quarter, up 14.1%. Sales in the previous quarter were powered by growth in appliances, tires, toys, gift cards, and food, health, and beauty aids, among other items like gold bars. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a "Top Pick." "We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum," he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise "from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands." He believes a stock split could be in the future. Shares are currently hovering around $1,000 per share. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Michael Sonnenshein, Ex-Grayscale CEO, Joins Tokenization Firm Securitize as COO

Real-world asset tokenization firm Securitize appointed Michael Sonnenshein, formerly CEO of asset management company Grayscale Investments, as chief operating officer. "There is massive demand for tokenization, and I am thrilled to join Securitize at such a pivotal moment for the company and the industry," Sonnenshein said in a Thursday statement. His appointment started on Dec. 9. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The process involves representing financial instruments like bonds, credit, commodities and other real-world assets on the blockchain in pursuit of operational efficiency, speedier settlements and cheaper transactions. Securitize is a key service provider and marketplace in the field, with over $1 billion worth of tokenized instruments on its platform. The company jointly manages asset management behemoth BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. BlackRock also invested in Securitize. "Michael is a trailblazer whose strategic vision and ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes have helped pave the way for establishing digital assets as a mainstream investment class," Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, said in a statement. Sonnenshein's appointment followed his departure earlier this year from Grayscale, where he had served as CEO since 2021. During his tenure, the company was one of the firms to have a spot-based bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. Grayscale had taken the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator's repeated refusal to allow it to convert its flagship, closed-end fund Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. Sonnenshein also joined Aptos Labs, developer organization of layer-1 blockchain Aptos (APT), as an adviser last month. Krisztian Sandor recently graduated from NYU's business and economic reporter program as a Fulbright fellow and worked with Reuters and Forbes previously. Originally from Budapest, Hungary, he is now based in New York. He holds BTC and ETH. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

Title: Nvidia is on a hiring spree in China

Despite mounting trade restrictions, Nvidia (NVDA-2.72%) is significantly expanding its presence in China, focusing on artificial intelligence chips for autonomous vehicles, Bloomberg reports. Both a Chinese government antitrust investigation and escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington complicate the semiconductor giant’s efforts. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia has boosted its China workforce by a third, going from a 3,000-employee headcount at the start of the year to its current 4,000-employee headcount. Among those hires are a team dedicated to self-driving cars. The expansion comes amid heightened Chinese regulatory scrutiny of U.S. technology firms, particularly those developing artificial intelligence systems. National security concerns have intensified as defense contractors and military suppliers increase their AI investments, adding to the economic tensions between the two nations. Last week, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. In turn, China announced that it would be curbing exports of the raw materials used to build those semiconductors to the U.S. Additionally, Nvidia itself is in the middle of an antitrust investigation by Chinese authorities regarding a chipmaker it acquired in 2020.

Title: Fartcoin Stuns The World With A $500 Million Market Cap: “Nobody Ever Went Broke Overestimating The Flatulence Of The American Public”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a quintessential memecoin with no utility whatsoever, has stunned the world by claiming a market-based capitalization in excess of $500 million. This development is all the more striking when one considers the well-founded hypothesis that the current memecoin season is still in its infancy, with much more insanity presumably in the offing. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Fartcoin does not lay claim to any intrinsic value. Instead, the memecoin draws the entirety of its worth from a vibrant community devoted to sharing flatulence-related jokes and memes. Even so, literally no one expected the memecoin to eclipse a $500 million market-based capitalization. BREAKING: Fartcoin's market cap is now greater than 38% of all American publicly-traded companies. pic.twitter.com/obLQK8LNTe — Hedgeye (@Hedgeye) December 12, 2024 For context, consider the fact that Fartcoin is now more valuable than a stunning 38 percent of all publicly-traded American companies! “Nobody ever went broke overestimating the flatulence of the American public.” - H.L. Mencken https://t.co/Dbkxz1Jxmx — Clifford Asness (@CliffordAsness) December 12, 2024 This development has predictably spawned a ton of humorous takes, including a play on H.L. Mencken's quote: Of course, as per historical precedents, the memecoin season is still in its infancy. In the previous crypto bull cycles, Bitcoin typically took the initial lead, followed by Ethereum's Ether, and then the memecoins started recording rip-roaring gains, capping off the peak mania phase of the cycle. Currently, however, Bitcoin is still in its lead phase, which lends credence to the hypothesis that the market will likely see many iterations of Fartcoin before the present cycle ends. Most coins are about a 2-3x away from former ATH Do with that information what you will $FTM $FET pic.twitter.com/r72c21nWFH — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2024 Consider the fact that many altcoins are still quite far away from their all-time highs recorded in the previous bull cycle. When the 6-month and below #Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves bands surpass ~80%, it's a good indication the market is over-heated, and a major price peak is likely... 🔥 Currently we're at around 55%, plenty of upside to go for #BTC!👆 pic.twitter.com/ZL5P7USMo9 — Bitcoin Magazine Pro (@BitcoinMagPro) December 12, 2024 And, as per Bitcoin's Realized Cap HODL Waves bands, the world's preeminent cryptocurrency still has room to run. New report from BlackRock today that recommends 1-2% exposure to Bitcoin ETF, first time they gave specific number (they put this out bc they had so much incoming on this q of how much?). pic.twitter.com/X7iF06xXFa — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 Interestingly, BlackRock provided another bullish jolt to Bitcoin today by formally recommending a portfolio allocation of 1 to 2 percent to spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the meantime, Fartcoin can feasibly clock-in additional gains. Just don't expect those gains to last. Consider the recent pump-and-dump in the Hawk Tuah memecoin as a cautionary reference point.

Title: Private credit firms are hot acquisition targets. As M&A ramps up next year, here are the firms likely to be bought.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/private-market-asset-management-deal-outlook-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-12T15:10:34Z

The trend in asset management is pretty clear — private markets are the new black. "If you're not in private markets or private credit, you'll need to move in that direction, or you'll get left behind," PwC financial services deal leader Greg McGahan told Business Insider. Asset managers who have traditionally relied on ETFs and mutual funds to make money are itching to expand into alternative assets to diversify their offerings and boost fee revenue, a new PwC report said. That demand and expectations that interest rates will continue to drop and incoming light-touch regulators mean asset managers are ready to dust off their dealmaking playbooks. Private credit firms specifically are in demand, as shown by the blockbuster BlackRock deal announced last week. The asset management giant agreed to buy the private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. And it's not just the traditional money managers. Private equity firms are also using acquisitions to strengthen their private credit capabilities and market presence. PwC sees increasing competition in private credit contributing to the consolidation of alternative asset managers. McGahan said private credit firms with between $30 billion and $70 billion in assets under management will be the ones to watch. They will either need to make a deal to grow bigger or be snapped up themselves. "Those types of shops potentially could be absorbed into other shops that are looking to grow their portfolios," he said. "It's either acquire or be acquired." Deals in alternatives will also be driven by aging founders in the private markets space who are trying to figure out succession planning and capitalizing on the ability to monetize their investments. For his part, McGahan is seeing his deals practice's work ticking up and "getting up to full capacity. We'll be at supersaturation levels pretty shortly. So, I think you're seeing that pent-up demand now manifest itself." While the marriage of firms operating in one investing discipline with another makes sense for diversification reasons, the actual integration of the two could be trickier. Culture and compensation are very different between traditional firms and alternatives. A portfolio manager at a publicly traded mutual fund might receive cash compensation and equity stakes. If you're a private equity manager, you're paid with carried interest, or a percentage of profits generated from the firm's investments. "Could you have within a large traditional manager basically an alternative platform where the PMs are earning multiples of the existing PMs on the traditional side? That's going to be a cultural challenge,' McGahan said. He added there are also operational differences and gave the example of a private credit firm using treasury functions daily versus a private equity firm that uses a couple times a month. The question of cultural fit is top of mind at BlackRock when the asset manager makes acquisitions, according to the firm's CFO Martin Small. BlackRock has made several high-profile acquisitions this year, snapping up Global Infrastructure Partners in January in addition to HPS. Small, who was part of many meetings with HPS's executive team to test the waters, said the cofounders shared important values with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and firm president Rob Kapito. "We all speak the same language," Small said at the Goldman Sachs Financial Conference in New York. "They're founders. Larry Fink and Rob Kapito are founders. We're client-centered firms. We believe in scale, we believe in global." Integrating two firms successfully requires lots of important — if technical— work behind the scenes, Small added. "People, platform, process — think about all the pedestrian things of the employee experience. You've got to be on the same email system, you've got to make sure people's laptops work, you've got to make their key cards work at the door, " he said. "All of that's done so we can just get to business on realizing the synergies and delivering for clients. Jump to

Title: Is Target Corp (TGT) the Best Department Store Stock to Buy Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corp-tgt-best-department-145236032.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) stands against the other best department store stocks to buy now. The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren't all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn't so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. She said the trends in the sector are changing, with around 75% of shopping journeys starting online at the outset. Although some of them end up with consumers paying visits to the brick-and-mortar stores, much of the shopping journeys end with sales happening online. Furthermore, the retail sector is showing consumer behavior that tends to undertake a multiple retailer journey these days. If it is a bigger purchase, most consumers prefer checking out four to five retailers, either online or offline. This poses a significant change in the sector as compared to around two decades ago. Moulton said that consumers have consistently shown the industry in many ways that they are experiencing the effects of the cost of living crisis. However, recent survey data by McKinsey shows that consumers have started to feel more confident, which is expected to be reflected in the busier Christmas period this year compared to the last couple of years. She is optimistic about the future, saying that although we are still in a tricky place, there is light at the end of the tunnel. McKinsey's estimates show that around 63% of consumers are expected to have an increased e-commerce spending forecast this holiday shopping season. The e-commerce spending forecast for around 27% of consumers is expected to remain the same, while it may decrease for 4% due to cutbacks. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are increasingly becoming more significant in the holiday shopping season, especially compared to Christmas shopping. Mouton said that the retail industry is seeing more and more concentration of sales in the days around Black Friday. That is tough for retailers, as it puts a significant amount of weight on the fairly narrow set of items that retailers work hard to put great deals against. The retail results for the 29th November weekend mark the culmination of nine months of work by most retailers. This includes sourcing good value, marketing their items, watching the trends in the days before the weekend itself, detecting the items getting more traffic, and more. Since the changing trends keep concentrating more and more sales in the precious Black Friday weekend, the stakes are high for retailers. Talking about the increasing role of generative AI in retail, Moulton said considerable experimentation is going on in the industry. However, she considers the present time to be too early to see it at scale. She said that several leaders are leveraging generative AI the right way, which means that the strongest are getting stronger. They are taking early advantage of such new capabilities. This holds special importance since cookies are now much less easy to use because of their increased regulation. This makes Gen-AI a substitute that leaders are leaning into. A woman purchasing groceries at a Target store, with a cart full of products. We sifted through stock screeners and financial media reports to compile a list of 10 department store stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) operates general merchandise department stores that offer its customers a wide range of products. It has approximately 2,000 stores across the US. The company saw an increase in its traffic growth in fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was attributed to its focus on newness and delivering strong value in a retail environment where consumers are focusing on value and discounts over brand loyalty. The company thus introduced over 2,000 discounts entering the holiday season after it received positive customer response to the thousands of discounts and deals it offered at the beginning of 2024. Therefore, this initiative is expected to drive similar sales growth in the crucial holiday season. Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) comparable sales grew in fiscal Q3 2024, and this growth was attributed to a 2.4% growth in traffic. This translates to over 10 million incremental transactions compared to 2023. The company's digital channel also grew by nearly 11% in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting increasing consumer behavior trends in online shopping. Its delivery services are also boosting growth, with the company's same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360, experiencing approximately 20% growth. Its Drive Up service also saw positive double-digit growth, accounting for over $2 billion in fiscal Q3 2024 sales.

BlackRock compares Bitcoin's volatility to tech stocks, urging a cautious introduction in multi-asset portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to a paper released Dec. 12, BlackRock suggests that a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation in multi-asset portfolios matches the risk levels found in portfolios holding technology stocks. The asset manager, which oversees trillions of dollars, frames this range as a strategic starting point for investors seeking diverse sources of risk. Bitcoin is proposed as an element that does not entirely mirror the movement of equities. As Bloomberg reported, BlackRock’s analysis shows that even though Bitcoin exhibits a lower correlation to other assets, its volatility amplifies overall risk in a manner not unlike portfolios heavily concentrated in a handful of large technology names. BlackRock’s CIO of ETF and index investments, Samara Cohen, notes that a small Bitcoin weighting may operate as a separate risk driver in a balanced allocation. Beyond 2%, the firm warns that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility would contribute an outsized share of total risk, potentially overshadowing other components. Per Bloomberg, BlackRock considers the 1% to 2% range sufficient to approximate the influence of major tech holdings, a well-known scenario among investors grappling with top-heavy equity benchmarks. This perspective appears amid Bitcoin’s sustained gains following November’s US presidential election. Trump’s victory, combined with public endorsements and ongoing institutional inflows, saw Bitcoin surpass $100,000 in December. Market observers attribute part of Bitcoin’s growth to demand from institutional players, and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has captured attention as a key vehicle. The Bitcoin ETF has achieved rapid asset growth and attracted substantial inflows. Its expansion represents a trend that has bolstered Bitcoin’s acceptance among traditional investors and reshaped debates about prudent exposure. As Forbes reported, BlackRock’s research parallels the Magnificent Seven technology stocks that have dominated a large share of the S&P 500’s value. The firm notes that Bitcoin’s market capitalization is smaller, its utility differs, and its fundamental drivers do not resemble corporate revenue streams. Still, the allocation’s overall risk contributions resemble those of a portfolio that leans heavily into a single prominent equity holding. While past cycles saw Bitcoin’s correlation to equities tighten, recent conditions have shown more distinct patterns influenced by policy shifts, macroeconomic shifts, and evolving investor sentiment. The paper hints that as Bitcoin becomes more integrated into mainstream portfolios, its volatility profile may shift. Widespread institutional adoption could eventually temper price fluctuations, changing the asset’s returns. BlackRock’s position does not call for larger allocations at this stage but instead emphasizes measured sizing to maintain stable portfolio risk parameters. Its analysis provides a framework for investors weighing incremental Bitcoin exposure as the asset finds its place in long-term portfolio construction.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit weekly lows: Has the bullish streak ended?

Investors are caught in a tug-of-war, balancing potential and risk as they await key developments. The past 40 days have been “highly volatile,” truly testing the patience of Bitcoin [BTC] stakeholders. The highs propelled BTC to its ATH of $104K, but the lows dragged it back to around $94K, leaving investors on edge. And the real challenge? It’s just beginning. Just two days ago, BlackRock’s (IBIT) support sparked nearly $300 million in net ETF inflows, sending Bitcoin surging 4% in one day. This institutional push helped BTC close above the $100K mark. But here’s the catch—the rally feels fragile. BlackRock’s inflows have since dwindled to net zero, signaling the end of a week-long surge streak. Even overall ETF inflows have halved. Meanwhile, whispers of a potential 25 bps rate cut by the Fed are keeping hopes alive, but Bitcoin’s biggest asset remains institutional backing. So, as early investors cash out as millionaires, all eyes are on the institutional heavyweights. Will they be the ones to push BTC toward the ambitious $200K target, or will their fading support trigger a new wave of doubt? Early investors seem to be cashing out at the pivotal $100K resistance level, signaling a retreat from greed and a pullback in risk appetite. Yet, the recent surge that catapulted Bitcoin above $101K—after weeks of fierce back-and-forth between the $94K and $100K price band—has sparked fresh optimism. According to AMBCrypto, this optimism remains somewhat cautious, driven more by “anticipation” than the actual “execution” of a Fed rate cut. While the U.S. job market shows promise with a decline in the unemployment rate, inflation has made a noticeable comeback. The CPI has risen to 2.7% on a yearly basis, with a slight 0.3% increase in just one month. With these mixed signals, all eyes are now on the upcoming FOMC meeting scheduled for next week. Will the Fed take a more conservative stance in response to the uptick in inflation, possibly opting for higher interest rates? Or will it lean more liberal, considering a rate cut to support the economy? Regardless, the short-term impact on Bitcoin’s price is already evident. Source : CryptoQuant U.S. investors have eagerly seized the opportunity to buy BTC, particularly through their Coinbase cohorts, after a period of distribution that dominated much of the second week of December. While this uptick is undeniably bullish, it could prove to be a temporary blip unless Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, spark sustained interest from both retail and institutional investors. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have become a popular way for retail investors to access Bitcoin’s volatility, with strong support from institutions. After the “Trump pump” sparked excitement, Bitcoin ETFs reached a record $1.3 billion in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $1.2 billion. Source : FarsideInvestors However, recent trends suggest a shift. BlackRock’s inflows have plateaued, ending a streak of consecutive gains. While this doesn’t signal a full bearish outlook for Bitcoin, it does highlight a dip in enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs, with overall inflows hitting a weekly low. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This reinforces AMBCrypto’s view of a more ‘cautious’ optimism in the market – enough to potentially set $100K as a bottom for Bitcoin, but not quite enough to drive it toward a new all-time high. Thus, the market is in a delicate balance, where hope remains, but the road to fresh highs seems uncertain.

Title: Wholesale inflation jumps more than expected as 'extended and bumpy journey' continues to Fed's target

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wholesale prices rose more than expected in November, adding to a string of sticky inflation prints. Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its producer price index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see — rose 3% from the year prior, up from the 2.4% in October and above the 2.6% increase economists had projected. This marked the highest year-over-year increase since February 2023. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4%, compared to the 0.2% seen in October. Excluding food and energy, "core" prices increased 3.4% year-over-year, above October's 3.1% increase. Economists had expected an increase of 3.2%. Meanwhile, month-over-month core prices increased 0.2%, in line with last month's rise and economist projections. “PPI isn’t so scary once you get past the headline," Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin said of this morning’s November Producer Price Index report. "While the underlying data quell fears of a new inflation surge, they don’t suggest a quick fall to 2% either. Producer prices, and the broader inflation complex, are on an extended and bumpy journey to the Fed’s goal.” Thursday's PPI reading comes one day after the release of the November Consumer Price Index showed core inflation rose 3.3% for the fourth straight month. The consumer price reading was largely in line with expectations, though, and did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. The sticky nature of the CPI print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Still, a combination of recent months of data has shown that inflation isn't quickly falling toward the Fed's 2% target. That has prompted investors to anticipate fewer Fed rate cuts in 2025 than initially hoped. "The Federal Reserve can feel largely pleased with the progress made on lowering high levels of inflation over the last couple years," BlackRock global CIO of fixed income Rick Rieder wrote in a note on Wednesday. "But the bulk of this progress is behind us now and inflation may remain stubbornly sticky near current levels for a time."

December 12, 2024 08:47 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 12 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide) label to reflect data from the FLOW kidney outcomes trial. The FLOW trial assessed the risk reduction from Ozempic® therapy in chronic kidney disease-related events, including persistent ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of persistent eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the FLOW trial, semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated a statistically significant and superior 24% risk reduction in kidney disease progression as well as cardiovascular and kidney death compared to placebo. In addition, the secondary endpoints in the trial showed that the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 18%, and the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 20%. “Approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, and there is a need for treatments that can help to reduce kidney disease progression," said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With this positive opinion, Ozempic® will become the first and only GLP-1 receptor agonist to show lowering of risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease." Novo Nordisk has also filed for a label expansion in the US, and a decision is expected in the first half of 2025. About FLOWFLOW was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-grouped, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comparing injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg with placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. The trial assessed the effect of the treatments on kidney outcomes for prevention of progression of kidney disease and risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as eGFR ≥50 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 and <5,000 mg/g or eGFR ≥25 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 with UACR >100 and <5,000 mg/g). A total of 3,533 people were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted in 28 countries at around 400 investigator sites. The FLOW trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of the FLOW trial was to demonstrate delay in progression of CKD and to lower the risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality through a composite primary endpoint consisting of the following five components: onset of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR according to the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) equation compared with baseline; onset of persistent eGFR (CKD-EPI) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2; initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation); death from kidney disease; or death from cardiovascular disease. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included annual rate of change in eGFR (CKD-EPI), major adverse cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) and all-cause death. The FLOW data were presented at the European Renal Association Congress (ERA) in May 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). About Ozempic® Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide is approved in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses under the brand name Ozempic® and indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.

Posted on 12/12/2024 4:15:28 AM PST by MtnClimber Within hours of his apprehension in Pennsylvania in connection with the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, scads of information rolled out about the life and times of suspect Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man who has been accused of the killing, and in a very short period of time, the Internet being a fast medium. We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family. SNIP It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

Shares of bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) jumped nearly 12% in pre-market trading amid social media speculation that it is building a data center with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META). The shares climbed to just under $30 as of 10:00 UTC. The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which offers broad exposure to the BTC mining sector, rose about 3% higher. Neither Miami, Fla.-based Hut nor Menlo Park, Calif.-based Meta has announced a partnership. **Speculative Post**Hut 8 appears to be partnering with Meta to develop a groundbreaking AI data center in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana.

Earlier this month, Meta said it was planning to build a $10 billion AI data center in Richland Parish, La., Reuters reported. There are similarities between bitcoin miners and AI data centers in the required equipment, computing power and energy to run it all. Some bitcoin miners have been dedicating resources to AI computation to diversify their revenue streams. Hut 8 previously announced a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering and a $250 million stock-repurchase program. The company has said it mined 94 BTC in November, a 6% month-on-month decrease. It holds 9,122 BTC ($921 million) on the balance sheet, the seventh-largest holder of bitcoin of any publicly traded company. Neither company immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In a historic turn, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has once again taken the top spot, with a whopping 90% of the global GPU market share in Q3 2024. This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Title: Meet Ritchie Ordonez, The Exec Masterminding Prime Video’s Next Steps In Europe
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/12/prime-video-europe-ritchie-ordonez-interview-1236196241/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: You might not have heard of Ritchie Ordonez, but she’s quietly become among the most important players in European streaming. Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Related Stories News Reese Witherspoon And Will Ferrell Fight Over A Wedding Date And Venue In Prime Video's 'You're Cordially Invited' Trailer Casting 'The Wheel Of Time' Adds Shohreh Aghdashloo To Season 3 Cast Within Amazon, her unit is now being referred to as EU Expansion (EUX), perhaps a clearer indicator of the direction of travel. However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents…’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make Prime Video “a first-stop entertainment destination,” as Ordonez calls it. Meanwhile, Fallout has been hit in most EUX territories thanks to the strong gaming cultures in the countries. “That makes us very excited about more of those gaming franchises like Tomb Raider and God of War coming to the service,” says Ordonez. Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Reacher, Anne Hathaway romcom The Idea of You and The Summer I Turned Pretty have all proven popular, along with German hit Maxton Hall: The World Between Us, which has been killing it on the platform and highlights a growing desire for European content, according to Ordonez. To that end, Prime Video recently launched Spanish zombie horror Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End (aka Apocalipsis Z: El Principio Del Fin), and it performed strong in the EUX countries. In Turkey, Korean series Marry My Husband, which was co-produced with local streamer TVING, landed well. “These programs are really starting to travel,” says Ordonez. On the movie front, she notes, “A lot cinemas haven’t bounced back in the way they would have liked post-Covid, and supporting that sector is important.” This means working with local exhibitors, distributors and producers, and being flexible enough to give films theatrical windows when needed. “During Covid, we had a lot of films that we had to launch direct-to-streaming just by virtue of there being no cinemas open, and we’ve seen the outcome on both of those methods,” says Ordonez. “We don’t see any cannibalization, frankly, when we have theatrical launches. In fact, a lot of those titles bring in new customers, even if they have a TVoD window on Prime Video. It’s so fragmented and people have so little time, but there is still a massive audience to tap into, and so we’re open to any of those models. Producers are excited about having that theatrical presence and that works, but other titles have gone direct-to-streaming and that’s been successful, too.” Looking ahead, Andrew Bennett is set to replace Barry Furlong at the head of Amazon Europe’s Prime Video teams. Prime Video VP of International Kelly Day said recently the long-serving Bennett, who is relocating from the U.S., would bring acumen in “content acquisition, partnerships and business development, marketing, and product/tech” to the role. Ordonez isn’t commenting ahead of the change, but it’s understood Prime Video Europe is taking a ‘business as usual’ approach before Bennett’s vision for the business takes shape. What she will say of 2025 is that she expects her key challenge to be “keeping up with the volume, and trying to figure out the models.” There could be more opportunistic deals such as the Viaplay agreement to add scripted to the slate, to offset “risky and expensive” original production, while on the unscripted front she points to how local versions of LOL have led to contestants landing Prime Video specials and building out their personalities. “That has really captured the local culture,” she adds. “If in 12 months’ time we can say the growth has continued and we’ve added to the slate with local originals, that would be a success, along with growing the channels and TVOD,” concludes Ordonez. “Getting the content right is the most challenging thing — you don’t have a lot of shots at that. We have to be thoughtful about it and we’re learning from all of the things we’ve launched.” Ordonez and co will soon get the chance to apply that knowledge to the next stage of EUX’s lifecycle.

Title: Assetera Enables Non-U.S. Investors to Trade Tokenized Nvidia, Coinbase, and S&P 500

Assetera, a Polygon-powered MiFID-licensed trading venue for blockchain-based securities in Europe, has listed Backed Finance's tokenized assets, offering non-U.S. investors to gain exposure to trackers linked to some of the most sought-after U.S. companies. The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens. When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading. These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. "This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation in financial markets and the empowerment of investors globally," Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera, said, as Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said it allows investors to get exposure to traditional financial assets via an onchain and regulated environment. Asset tokenization is the process of using blockchain technology to convert a traditional asset's value into a digital token, facilitating 24/7 availability, access for all, composability and instant global collateral mobility. A 2022 projection by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the value of the tokenized asset market at an astounding $16 trillion in 2030 versus less than $100 billion today. Regulatory uncertainty and security concerns have long hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets, but Assetera is tackling these challenges using rigorous adults to mitigate vulnerabilities. The company told CoinDesk that it uses AI-powered real-time monitoring systems to detect and address suspicious activity, adding that Backend's robust and scalable infrastructure and expertise in democratizing finance through tokenization solidified the partnership.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 96% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. Asian markets also mostly gained, with South Korea's Kospi leading the advance, up 1.78%. South Korea's "Korea discount" to remain entrenchedSouth Korean markets have had a dismal 2024, with the so-called "Korea discount" in its stock markets widening compared to other global peers. The recent political upheaval is expected to entrench this phenomenon as efforts to reform the South Korean markets take a back seat amid political turmoil in the country. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Founded by Martin Kassing (pictured above), the Berlin-based startup builds a white-label investment platform that is used by some of the biggest fintech companies in Europe. Upvest clients include Bunq, N26, Plum, Raisin, Revolut, Shares and Vivid. Overall, 50 million people can access Upvest’s trading platform. Signing all these big names as clients led to today’s news: Upvest is announcing a €100 million Series C round (or around $105 million at current exchange rates). Hedosophia, a VC firm that used to be somewhat secretive about their portfolio, is leading the round. Sapphire Ventures is also investing, as well as existing backers Bessemer Venture Partners and BlackRock. While Upvest isn’t disclosing its valuation following the Series C round, the company said it’s “significantly higher” than its previous valuation (after its $42 million Series B). “We believe their full-stack system addresses the unique challenges of enterprise banks, fintechs, and D2C platforms with exceptional usability, innovation, and resilience,” Sapphire Ventures partner Andreas Weiskam said in a statement. Companies that use Upvest’s API can offer fractional stock trading and access to other financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. The company doesn’t want to stop here as it plans to offer crypto, derivatives, ELTIFs (European Long-Term Investment Funds), and bonds in any currency in the near future. In 2024 alone, Upvest has processed 20 million orders. That figure should be much higher next year as the company has seen around one million trades per week recently. The startup also plans to sign new customers as it recently obtained an authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate in the U.K. While Upvest can accept clients across the Eurozone and U.K., the company still has some work to do to offer a trading platform that feels truly local in all markets since many customers prefer to invest through special investment accounts. For instance in France, a regulated savings account that allows you to investment in a portfolio of shares of European companies — which is called a PEA (or Plan d’Épargne en Actions) — is particularly popular. Such accounts have been designed to encourage individuals to hold shares and securities over the long run. If they hold their positions for at least five years and make a profit, they get a preferential tax treatment. Similarly, the U.K. has other popular products like ISA (a tax-free savings account) and SIPP (a pension wrapper). Upvest is well aware of these geographic differences and plans to add support for local solutions in the future. Such additional features will create a barrier to entry for competitors trying to build a white-label investment platform. But on the topic of competitors, Bitpanda also offers a white-label solution that has been used by fintechs Lydia and N26 (for the crypto investment features). These companies aren’t just trying to build the best technological platform. They have to secure licenses, sign new partners, and scale with their clients. And Upvest now has plenty of money in the bank to support its next 50 million customers.

Title: Bite-sized tips for adding oomph to Christmas parties and dinners

As a delicious starter, Frank Hederman at Belvelly Smokehouse recommends serving hot smoked salmon with al dente red cabbage spiced and sweetened with caramelised onion and dried fruits, and cut with fresh ginger, orange zest and background notes of sherry vinegar. frankhederman.com Master of ceremonies at Kilkenny Savour food festival Siobhan Donohue serves the family bread sauce recipe with a splash of Highbank Orchard’s organic apple treacle. O’Keefe likes a silky butter sauce spiked with white mausu smoky chilli oil. highbankorchards.com; savourkilkenny.com A visit to Forbes Street by Gareth Mullins, in Dublin’s Docklands, is the perfect start to the season. This motorcycle-riding, Donaghmeade born and bred chef believes that a wonderful all-Irish cheese board is the perfect food for sharing with family and friends as a yuletide feast. His counsel is to “start by choosing a soft goat cheese like St Tola from Co Clare, a delicious hard, like a Coolattin cheddar from west Wicklow, a washed-rind like Gubbeen from west Cork and, of course, a blue cheese, like Cashel Blue from Tipperary. Add a good relish, some grapes, toasted nuts, organic honey and crusty bread.” forbesstreet.ie For a fragrant finish to my Christmas meal, writes Clare Anne, I will be scattering Hadji Bey’s Original Rose Turkish Delight and pomegranates across the tablescape to create an edible centrepiece to be served with Cork’s wonderful Cafe Izz Palestinian coffee. Gifts will be unwrapped too at this stage. On my list this year is a Hugo Byrne knife to slice up Tom Durkan’s award-winning spiced beef. hugobyrneknives.com; corkcity.ie Canapés, anyone? Served either warm or cold, Ireland AM regular Edward Hayden’s beef and cranberry filo tartlets, and tangy lamb skewers, are easy-to-eat, bite-sized morsels that feature meat from O’Brien Butchers and John Stone. obrienbutchers.ie; johnstonebeef.com At a soirée at the home Katia Valadeau of ProperFood.ie a simple platter is served, consisting of smoked trout with crème fraîche, capers, shaved onions, lemon zest, dill and black pepper, topped with Irish caviar, specifically, Goatsbridge trout caviar. goatsbridgetrout.ie Bettina Lopes, a wine expert and co-owner of Little Italy, in Smithfield, Dublin 7, advocates an Italian aperitivo approach to party bites. She piles ricotta and truffle or delicious pistachio pesto on to slices of mortadella on ciabatta, served with an Amarena Spritz, the Italian cherry syrup with prosecco and a splash of Campari, or simply Amarena cherries dropped into Sanbitter Dry, to create a non-alcoholic festive spritz. She also brings a panettone as a host gift. littleitalyltd.com A walk, followed by time in your local, is a great way to gather with friends at Christmas. For Clare Anne, this usually means a tramp around the Phoenix Park to see the deer, followed by a glass of punch at L Mulligan Grocer, where Seáneen Sullivan, a food and folklore scholar, is the mixologist. Her party punch is made of one part lemon juice, two parts simple sugar syrup, three parts Longueville House apple brandy to four parts soda water – to be added when ordered, just before serving over ice, she explains. She chills the mixture, minus the soda water, in bottles and has it in her fridge to serve to guests or to bring to a party as a last-minute yet thoughtful gift. Her non-alcoholic version features Irish apple juice, cordials from Naturally Cordial in Wexford and a tonic from Poacher’s range. lmulligangrocer.com At home I shuck my own shells and add a teaspoon of ice-cold, Cuinneog, Irish farmhouse natural buttermilk, to my au nature bivalves. For a festive treat I book a table at Allta Bar and Bottle Shop, in Dublin’s Three Locks Square, where Cromane oysters are on the menu. I enjoy them with a drop of Allta’s house-made fermented chilli sauce. allta.ie Publican turned organic farmer Mick Foggarty’s Christmas highlight is his St Stephen’s Day sandwich. This features the usual leftovers but Mick’s secret is to add crushed bacon fries to the mix; he recommends picking up a pack in the pub on Christmas Eve before you leave. This whiskey expert and farmer of Beechpark Eco Farm, who is a fan of Crowe Farm’s outdoor-raised Bronze turkeys, sets out strict rules about how to construct this morning-after cure. [ It’s the most eagerly anticipated sandwich of the year. Here’s how to make yours epicOpens in new window ] “Heat your turkey in the leftover gravy and fry up the leftover veg,” says Mick. “Get two slices of bread and spread one side of each with cranberry sauce. Add the hot meat and gravy to the cranberry sauce side of one slice of bread and then top with the vegetables, crush the bacon fries and put them on top of the vegetables and then top with the other slice of bread, sauce side down. Cut in half, eat and say goodbye to that Christmas hangover.” beechparkfarm.com; crowefarm.ie Run out of fridge space? Don’t just think outside the box – think outside the house, says chef and author Graham Herterich: “When I need extra space in the fridge for the Christmas Day prep, I do a clear-out of half jars of condiments or vegetables or anything that’s not very perishable from the fridge and they move to either the boot of the car or a secure box outside for few days. “They’ll be grand outside in the cold, and it means we’ve loads of room then for all the extra Christmas meats and stuff like that.” Santa is not the only one who needs a list, says cook and food writer William Murray: “A key tool of experienced cooks and chefs is an ‘order of work’, a detailed yet straightforward list and plan of attack for the big day with times and jobs. Things like getting your prep done, when to preheat the oven, what to put in the oven in what order etc. “Some of these things might seem obvious but, trust me, having a detailed plan to refer to on the day is essential, especially if you tend to be messy like me. And don’t forget the delegation of jobs to others.” Ikea is not a place most of us would think about picking up Christmas food but it’s a must for Mickael Viljanen, chef-patron of two-Michelin-starred Chapter One. He pairs Ikea gingerbread biscuits with Cashel Blue for a Christmas Eve treat: “They’re delicious together with a lovely glass of wine, like a dry Riesling.” He’s also into adding some sweetness to his stuffing: “Instead of using normal breadcrumbs, I blitz up a loaf of brioche into breadcrumbs. It soaks up the fat and flavours much better, and makes a much tastier stuffing. I like to add some dried cranberries to mine, as well as the usual herbs.” Chef Barry Sun of Volpe Nero in Dublin is also thinking ahead about snacks when he’s planning: “I always purchase the makings of some simple snacks to serve with Christmas drinks. I like to slice and toast good quality sourdough, add a drizzle of olive oil, a spoon of stracciatella, finish with anchovy fillets and season. Simple but always impressive”. A whole turkey can often be too much if you’re cooking for a smaller number, says Carol Barrett, owner of Dunmore House Hotel in Co Cork. To avoid any waste, she recommends asking your butcher to take off the legs and mince the leg meat, to be used another time. “It’s great for a bolognese pasta or burgers in the new year,” says Barrett. “This also makes your turkey crown easier to roast and manage.” To brine or not to brine is often a question when it comes to Christmas turkey. Chef Dan Hannigan is firmly in the brining camp. “I always brine my turkey,” he says. “It imparts extra flavour – and not just for the turkey. A sneaky little extra tip would be to reserve some of your brine and add cabbages cut into four pieces, with the root left on, for a couple of hours, and then pan fry them when cooking the dinner for the most sensational cabbage of your life.” Or how about jazzing up shop-bought cranberry sauce? Sateesh Sayana, chef-patron of Ruchii restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, spices his jarred sauce with sliced apple and pears. “Toss them in a pan with butter, bay leaves, cinnamon and sugar. Once the fruits have caramelised, add to the cranberry sauce. This little addition will elevate the tart cranberry flavour and show your guests you went to a little extra effort when serving your turkey and ham.” If you’re catering for vegetarians and vegans, don’t forget to ditch the duck fat when roasting your spuds. Instead, Holly White offers advice for getting perfect crispy potatoes that will satisfy everyone at the table. “To boost the flavour of my roast potatoes once they are parboiled I coat them in lots of crushed garlic, thyme and olive oil before roasting them in a hot oven until crisp. I make sure to shuffle them halfway through, breaking up the edges, allowing them to absorb all the flavours, and then serve them piping hot and seasoned well.” There’s nothing quite like a freshly baked mince pie at Christmas but making the real deal can be laborious. Instead, JR Ryall, head pastry chef at Ballymaloe House, has a quick-fix idea he calls “a festive game-changer”: bite-size mince pie turnovers. “They’re so much quicker to assemble than traditional mince pies, and the best part is that they can be baked straight from the freezer,” says Ryall. “Every year, in late November, I set aside some time to make a batch. I simply fold a small circle of pastry over a spoonful of mince-pie filling, creating little half-moon pies, seal the edges, and freeze them on trays. Once they’re frozen, I store them in an airtight container, ready to be baked whenever Christmas visitors arrive. No special baking tray required.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Today, the city is exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial system. Vancouver City Council voted Wednesday to explore ways to make the city "Bitcoin-friendly," taking a bold step into crypto despite potential regulatory hurdles. The controversial motion, spearheaded by Mayor Ken Sim, was approved at the City Council's Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday. Specifically, the motion directs council staff to explore accepting taxes and fees in Bitcoin and converting part of the city’s financial reserves into Bitcoin to protect against inflation and currency volatility. Thirty-four people spoke to the motion, with supporters from ABC Vancouver and opposition from Green Party members. Sim is a party member of the former. While the approval doesn't immediately commit the city to crypto investments, it initiates a comprehensive study of potential Bitcoin integration into municipal finances. However, the directive faces immediate roadblocks. The British Columbia Ministry of Municipal Affairs confirmed that crypto isn't currently recognized as a legal form of payment for municipalities, explicitly stating that local governments cannot hold financial reserves in crypto. Sim, who has disclosed that he has investments in Coinbase Global and Purpose Bitcoin ETF, remained undeterred. "Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years," Sim said in an interview with Canadian news outlet Global News before the vote. "To not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless," he added. The council chamber saw divided opinions among its members. ABC Councilor Peter Meiszner, while voting in favor, expressed caution about the difference between private and public crypto investment. Meanwhile, Green Councilor Pete Fry opposed the motion, citing money laundering concerns previously raised by the Vancouver Police Department. "Governments have to catch up," Sim said, pledging a personal $10,000 Bitcoin donation to the city regardless of the vote's outcome. Environmental implications also emerged as a key point of contention. Councilor Adriane Carr highlighted worries about Bitcoin's electricity demands, which are particularly relevant given recent council debates about the city's power grid capacity. Decrypt has reached out to ABC Vancouver for comments on how this could be implemented once the feasibility study is completed. The approved motion directs city staff to return with a feasibility report by Q1 2025, examining potential crypto integration into municipal operations and investment strategies. That timeline coincides with the broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, including recent moves by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity. Bitcoin is trading at just over $100,000, a price milestone that it reached 15 years after Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator, envisioned a financial revolution.

Title: Future proofing: BlackRock’s billionaire bonanza and putting talent to work

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is adding a clutch of new billionaires to its payroll. Photo / 123RF OPINION BlackRock has bought a bonanza of billionaires. Now comes the challenge of keeping them in line. The world’s largest asset manager has been on a US$28 billion ($48.2b) acquisition tear, snapping up two of the best known firms that specialise in the complex and rapidly growing fields of infrastructure, private credit and other alternative assets. To gain a stronger foothold, the US$11.5 trillion money manager has opted to pay dearly for outside talent and take steps to ensure that it sticks around long enough to make a difference. Last week’s US$12b-plus deal for private credit specialist HPS will make billionaires of Scott Kapnick and the other two founders, but they will be paid out over a five-year period and the final total is contingent on the deal meeting performance targets. Similarly, BlackRock’s US$12.5b purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners earlier this year has collectively made five GIP founders the second largest BlackRock shareholder, and it too has a five-year payout. The £2.55b ($5.6b) deal for private markets data provider Preqin is an all-cash transaction so it places fewer constraints on founder Mark O’Hare, but he had already stepped down as chief executive in 2022. With nine new billionaires due to come on the payroll, BlackRock founder Larry Fink is moving quickly to put them to work. The top two GIP executives have already joined BlackRock’s global executive committee and the three HPS founders will follow suit. GIP chair Adebayo Ogunlesi also sits on the BlackRock board of directors, while Kapnick will become an observer. In theory, that all makes good sense. While BlackRock has built a commanding position in traditional asset management and associated technology, its private markets business has historically punched below its weight. Ogunlesi and Kapnick are towering Wall Street figures, with entrepreneurial chops in precisely the areas where the larger firm wants to grow. Each has staked his personal wealth and substantial reputation on becoming part of what Fink likes to refer to as “One BlackRock”, with all the cross-selling and joint product development that implies. In practice, management meetings with that many newly minted billionaires in the room are going to be something to behold. These are men accustomed to running their own shows. Now they must deal with one another, the other BlackRock executives, and the constraints of being part of a 20,000-employee public company. Fink, of course, is more than qualified to play ringmaster to his newly recruited private capital lions. They may have created highly profitable boutiques, but he has built a global juggernaut and run it for more than 35 years. He also has experience with integrating multiple bet-the-farm acquisitions, including the 2006 deal for Merrill Lynch’s asset management arm and the 2009 purchase of Barclays Global Investors. That invites the question of what happens after Fink, who recently turned 72, steps back. Before the HPS deal, he had been walking a fine line between saying he still loved his job while also assuring investors that he had “no higher priority” than ensuring a smooth succession. Last January, the company granted chunky stock option packages to three men it described as “senior leaders who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock’s future”. Rob Goldstein, Martin Small, and Mark Wiedman are longtime BlackRock managers, rather than entrepreneurs like the new arrivals. “Buying an entrepreneurial business is very risky because entrepreneurs drive it in a particular way and managers don’t ... They don’t fit together particularly well,” says Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert. BlackRock could tap one of the HPS or GIP leaders to replace Fink, but each firm is so highly specialised that BlackRock watchers find it hard to imagine the leader of one or the other at the top of the gigantic financial supermarket that the company has become. Fink currently shows no sign of slowing down. He has been on the road all year visiting clients and political leaders, including recent high profile stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. He also sounded energised on last week’s investor call about the challenges of integration and the prospects of combining HPS with BlackRock’s offerings. Still, investors and BlackRock’s board cannot afford to be complacent. The company is due to appoint a new lead independent director in 2025. That person should take a fresh look at transition planning and consider whether the pool of possible candidates is large and deep enough. The bigger Fink’s shoes grow, the harder they will be to fill. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 95% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. ETFs cross $1 trillion of inflows The exchange-traded fund industry has surpassed $1 trillion of total inflows for the first time ever, according to research firm ETFGI and the Investment Company Institute. The fund that has enjoyed the biggest demand so far this year is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which raked in roughly $100 billion. U.S. ETFs now have more than $10 trillion in assets. The previous record for U.S. ETF inflows was about $920 billion in 2021. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Got a confidential news tip?

Merely 0.55% of shareholders supported a proposal for buying and holding Bitcoin. The leading crypto by market capitalization surpassed $100,000 per coin once again on Wednesday. According to the annual Microsoft Investor Relations report, 28.234 million Microsoft shareholder votes were cast in favor of the proposal, compared to an overwhelming 5.148 billion against, with 22.6 million abstentions. Microsoft’s board of directors urged shareholders to vote down the proposal ahead of the shareholder vote, citing the cryptocurrency’s volatility. “Bitcoin is a more volatile asset, at the moment than corporate bonds, so companies should not risk shareholder value by holding too much of it,” Microsoft said during the shareholder meeting. “However, as Bitcoin is an excellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation and corporate bond yields are less than the true inflation rate, companies should also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether.” While the majority of shareholders rejected the proposal, Microsoft acknowledged that companies should evaluate the benefits of holding at least 1% of their assets in Bitcoin. The Microsoft shareholder's ultimate vote comes as several companies begin to stack the asset on their balance sheets this year as part of their corporate strategies. Earlier this month, healthcare technology company, Semler Scientific, added $30 million in Bitcoin. On Monday, the National Center for Public Policy recommended Amazon convert at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. A decision is expected sometime next year in the Spring. Microsoft highlighted Microstrategy as the largest private Bitcoin holder. This company recently acquired an additional $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at approximately $42 billion. “Microstrategy—which, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet—has had its stock outperform Microsoft stock this year by 313% despite doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has. And they’re not alone,” according to a proxy statement. “The institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin is becoming more commonplace. Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, offers its clients a Bitcoin ETF.” Despite rejecting the Bitcoin proposal, Microsoft noted that it evaluates a wide range of assets to invest. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team said it will continue to monitor trends related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency “to inform future decision-making.” “As the proposal itself notes, volatility is a factor to consider in evaluating cryptocurrency investments for corporate treasury applications that require stable and predictable investments to ensure liquidity and operational funding,” Microsoft said.

Title: Watch These GE Vernova Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Investor Update
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ge-vernova-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-investor-update-8759465
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:12:51Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) shares jumped on Wednesday, one day after the energy equipment maker raised its long-term sales outlook. The company, which projected 2028 sales of about $45 billion, also announced a 25-cent quarterly dividend and $6 billion stock buyback. Since the company’s spinoff from GE Aerospace (GE) on April 2 as part of three-way breakup of the General Electric conglomerate, GE Vernona shares have more than doubled, boosted by surging demand for gas turbines and electrical grid equipment used to generate power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 5% to close Wednesday near $344. Below, we take a closer look at GE Vernova’s chart and apply technical analysis to locate important price levels worth watching after the company’s financial update. After topping out in November, GE Vernova shares consolidated within an ascending triangle before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline in Tuesday’s trading session. However, the shares staged an impressive intraday reversal today to close back within the triangle on the highest trading volume since early June, potentially creating a bear trap in the process. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned upwards after several consecutive lower readings, signaling improving price momentum. Let’s identify important overhead areas on GE Vernova's chart to watch and also point out two key support levels to monitor during retracements. Amid further buying, investors should watch how the stock's price responds to the $355 area, a region on the chart where it may encounter selling pressure near the ascending triangle's top trendline. To project a price target above the stock's record high, investors can use the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior price action to forecast future moves. To apply the tool to GE Vernova’s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $45 to $355, which projects a bullish target of $400, an area where those who bought the stock at lower levels could decide to lock in profits. The first lower level to watch sits around $295. This area, currently situated just below the 50-day moving average, could provide support near the low of a bullish engulfing pattern and other nearby trading activity that formed on the chart towards the top of the stock’s trending move between August and November Finally, selling below this area could see a decline to the $258 level, a region on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near a cluster on candlesticks positioned around the September peak.

Title: 2025 Tech Year in Review: An Opinionated Guide to the Events that will have the Biggest Long-Term Impacts
URL: https://softwareas.com/2024-tech-year-in-review
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:00:00Z

Four-year cycles - whether elections, Olympics, or World Cup - have long been a revealing way to observe changes in technology. (Fun fact: four years represents a more than a tripling in tech capability, if you take Moore’s Law as a generality, i.e. log(4)/log(1.5) ~= 3.4 ). In this election cycle, podcasts were a hot topic, with some dubbing it “The Podcast Election”. Both candidates went on presidential podcast tours alongside traditional rallies. Trump, in particular, appeared on at least fourteen podcasts, including some of the most popular podcasters across all genres. His VP, JD Vance, appeared on even more podcasts than Trump. Just as telling was the pressure and intrigue around a Joe Rogan appearance. Joe Rogan Experience is by no means a conventional political show, but is easily the most popular podcast in terms of audience and cultural influence. After much drama, Trump appeared weeks before the election, quickly followed by Vance, and leading to even more speculation around a Harris appearance that never happened and was blamed by some for losing the election (or at least, as an indicator that the winning candidate in future would need to be the kind of person who is comfortable appearing in this kind of space). The election also shows the limits of politicians generating their own podcast. Their external appearances were more decisive, and that’s because those podcasts have spent years building up loyal followings. Anecdotally, politicians around the world have taken note and are gearing up in their relations with podcasters. In other podcasting news, Lex Fridman demonstrated the possibilities of AI translation when he interviewed Argentina’s president. Fridman recorded the interview with him speaking English and with President Milei speaking Spanish; his podcast was then able to publish all-English and all-Spanish versions, both in their own voices. In coming years, we can expect to see all forms of media available in any language. This is an example of innovation that (a) boosts quality - since it’s possible to keep original voices and match face movements in video - while (b) smashing costs at the same time since it’s completely automated. The implications are dramatic as anyone with talent no longer needs to speak a major language in order to be discovered by the global community. This will lead to a further flattening of the world and winner-takes-all dynamic across media. It may also help with language preservation as it takes away some of the major motivations for people to learn a second language. On the theme of podcasts and influence, there was also a new podcast designed to promote an activist investor campaign, so that’s a first (as far as I know). The prominent activist investor Elliot launched the StrongerSouthwest podcast as part of an activist campaign against Southwest, It’s already gone, though, so I guess it was either a misfire or an overnight success? On a personal note, I predicted “2008 will be the Podcast Election” in ye olde podcast FAQ. That probably says more about my techno-optimistic bias than anything meaningful about podcasts or politics. Nuclear fission energy is enjoying a renaissance on multiple fronts. Institutions concerned with climate change have, to some degree, warmed to nuclear energy. The European Union, for example, finally included nuclear as part of its sustainable activities taxonomy (albeit “transitional” state for now). Anecdotally, there appears to be a generation gap among environmentalists, with older members sticking to the long-held party lines while newer members seeing the compromise as valid. While renewable energy tech has improved immeasurably, there’s still a big gap between tomorrow’s potential and today’s immediate needs. Sanctions and sentiment have caused many nations to become more open-minded about energy solutions. Oil was an exception made as part of sanctions against Russia and drives the economies of other countries with frozen relations. Then there’s AI and the every-growing needs of cloud providers. This was the marked change in 2024. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all have big plans to fuel their data centres this way, which will validate the technology in the eyes of governments and businesses. These companies have driven entire revolutions when it comes to software, hardware, and network infrastructure, meaning we’re likely to see their brightest engineers breathe new life into nuclear, an industry that stagnated in the west for decades. The biggest AI story of 2024 was equal parts drama and substance, namely The Her Incident. In May, ChatGPT announced its upgraded voice assistant with an impressive set of demos. While ChatGPT already had a voice assistant for premium users, most people hadn’t noticed because (a) they’re not paying (the source of many falsehoods about ChatGPT’s capabilities) (b) it was not very good, particularly because it had a habit of jumping in with a pile of verbiage after the user makes the slightest pause, making it the world’s most superintelligent interrupter. Even founder/CEO Sam Altman was rubbishing it in his All-In interview, which as it turns out was just a few days before they would announce the voice upgrade. I’ll get the drama out of the way. The voice in the demos sounded suspiciously like Scarlett Johansson, the star of Her, the 2013 movie that envisioned the near-future reality of a lonely dude forming a romantic relationship with his intelligent voice assistant. Turned out she had been approached by OpenAI prior to this to license her voice for training, and declined. She subsequently expressed dismay and threatened a lawsuit as OpenAI pulled the Johansson-like voice option (“Sky”). As for the voice feature itself, remarkable. It’s getting tantalisingly close to speaking with a real human assistant. It’s fast. It gets straight to the point instead of waffling on like a long-form text-based chat session. It’s not perfect, but you can easily interrupt it and say something else if you feel it’s missed the point or is waffling on. While it might take a little while longer to match the conversation skills of an average human, one can’t lose sight that it already holds great advantages over any human, i.e., vast built-in knowledge on any subject, ability to look things up online and make sense of them in a fraction of a second, and always being present. Furthermore, many people just find it easier to work with voice than reading and typing - there’s a reason text-based social media like Twitter and Reddit never captured the masses like Instagram or TikTok. Even those who find comfort in text nevertheless find themselves equipped with the ability to multitask using their voice at the same time. Or use it while walking around or doing chores, just like people heretofore listen to music and podcasts. For these reasons, I believe we’re close to the tipping point envisioned in Her. The core functionality is already there; it’s just a matter of hardware integration to make communication seamless and always-available instead of having to pull out your phone and launch into a specific screen within a specific app. Voice was far from the only OpenAI upgrade this year. OpenAI also launched o1, their first model to be explicitly based on Chain Of Thought reasoning (CoT). Anthropic and Google likewise enhanced the reasoning capabilities of their models. To understand CoT, it’s important to be aware that a basic LLM works by producing one “token” (~ word) at a time, being guided by what has been composed up to that point. This is append-only, which is to say, there is no backtrack or explicit planning capability. It’s remarkable how well this has worked in practice. but still leaves opportunity for advanced strategies that would be closer to the way humans reason. In the simplest case, prompt engineering can be used, like appending an instruction with “think about this problem, outline the steps involved first, and address it step by step”. This can encourage the LLM to break down its response into sub-tasks and ensure each sub-task is more aware of what subsequent sub-tasks will need of it. Nevertheless, this is still a sequential activity. Chain-of-Thought goes a step further by baking reasoning directly into the model. With GPT 4-o, OpenAI refined GPT-4 by training it on examples of reasoning, where a complex task is broken into sub-tasks. Thus the LLM becomes inherently more capable at breaking any complex task into sub-tasks. A side benefit of this “divide-and-conquer” logic is a degree of transparency, where users can get some insight into the LLM’s inner workings. Indeed, ChatGPT updated its user-interface for 4-o to explicitly show steps as they’re being worked on before any response is produced. During this preparation phase, it conceptually has the ability to cycle through steps, go back and forth, before it finally begins outputting. In some cases, the LLM might “think” for 30 seconds or more, while for simpler tasks, it can immediately output an answer just like earlier models did. A future enhancement which will speed thing up is parallel processing, where the LLM can determine in advance that certain sub-tasks may be computed independently of each other, thus running them in parallel. Since a single human cannot multitask, this is another example where LLMs will be able to surpass human capability. After centuries of mythology and science-fiction - and decades of actual research - artificial humanoids are now becoming a reality. LLMs have been the most obvious beneficiary of AI research recently, but robotics stands to benefit from many of the same underlying technologies at both a software and a hardware level. In the same way LLMs benefitted from years of spend from video game enthusiasts, the nascent field of humanoid robotics is benefitting indirectly from spend on LLMs due to the value they are already delivering their customers today. China has long been investing heavily to automate manufacturing, thereby hoping to keep its lead even as the industry is disrupted by robotics, which could make it viable for some countries to promote a resurgence of local factories. Humanoid robotics is likely to form part of China’s strategy in this effort, and Chinese car maker BYD is also operating Walker robots on its assembly line. In the US, robotics startup Figure AI raised at a $2.6 billion valuation and announced Figure 02 in August. Figure robots worked on BMW’s assembly line as part of a trial this year. These industrial applications - where the robot’s environment is controlled and limited to repetitive tasks - should help to build confidence, revenue, and capability to expand into domestic applications over the next decade. Tesla is one company aiming to provide home robots and appears to be making good progress on its Optimus line. No-one would ever bet on Musk’s timelines, but for what it’s worth, the company claims it will be using 1000 robots internally next year. Tesla is a recent entrant and may not yet have caught up, but has among the deepest pockets and Musk has a track record of taking mere ideas from ideas to one. He also now finds himself with significant political power that will be helpful in attracting funding and navigating regulation. In 2024, DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded Nobel prizes for the contribution to solving the “folding problem”. This is a decades-old effort to figure out how the shape of a protein molecule will turn out, based solely on the sequence of amino acids that constitute its raw ingredients. Being able to make such predictions is far more than an intellectual exercise, as it unlocks the ability to generate therapies through software models, which is much faster and easier to automate than conventional lab-based techniques. As with LLMs, AlphaFold achieves this by training on verified pairings of inputs and outputs. In this case, the inputs are amino acids and the outputs are 3-dimensional shapes. As was mentioned with respect to robotics, this is another area where the technology is converging across domains, leading to economies of scale that make all of those domains more productive. While the Nobel was awarded for earlier work, DeepMind achieved another milestone this year in launching AlphaFold 3. This is the first major version to expand its scope beyond protein molecules, into predicting shape of DNA and other small molecules. It it also more “automated” insofar as it doesn’t rely on certain knowledge and rules of physics and chemistry, i.e., it is more capable of figuring out these things on its own just by pattern-matching. This mirrors the broader trend in AI away from the pile of “hard-coded if-then statements” to “it just works” if you throw enough data and compute at the problem. There’s increasing interest in AI drug discovery, with one drug already in Phase 2 testing, and one of the enabling technologies is software that models how the body will respond to such interventions. Hence the relevance of AlphaFold. Its applications also go beyond therapies to industrial design such as new forms of plastics. Social media continued to fragment in 2024. The latest wave of X departures came after the US election, in which its owner-CEO completed his transition from self-described politically neutral to giving full-throated support to one candidate. In my experience, the algorithm has become unbearable under Musk’s management, not necessarily because of any political bias, but because everything is heavily off-topic from my interests and because I’ve lost any meaningful connection to my contacts. Add potential bias to the mix and it’s easy to see why people continue to abandon the platform. Surprisingly, it was BlueSky that picked up most of the followers rather than Meta’s Threads. Ever since 2022 - when Musk announced his takeover - there has been a never-ending cycle of communities moving from one place to another and back again. I wouldn’t confidently predict BlueSky will still be the big winner in 2025, but it would certainly be pleasing to see it reach critical mass, since there’s a world of potential in its open standards and ability for anyone to create a feed algorithm. The problem for all these platforms is fragmentation. Just as social media apps can rise quickly when they have a large user base, so can they collapse quickly as their user base dwindles. For this reason, it’s not surprising that apps are focused on curating the best content from across the whole network instead of worrying about the follower network. It makes them more attractive to new users who don’t have any contacts present or who have lost all their content to another platform. Nevertheless, it also removes one of the most powerful aspects of these apps in the first place. As Mark Zuckerberg mentions in just about every interview, his company is all about social connections, which makes it ironic to see an app like Threads focus so much of users’ attention on the celebrities of Instagram instead of those they follow. The biggest beneficiary may be a discussion app that never pretended to be about social connections. Reddit has always been about topics first, posts and comments second, user reputations a mere afterthought. After disappearing third-party apps in 2023, the site went public in 2024, making it the highest-profile tech IPO. The stock has performed exceptionally even taking to account the bull market backdrop, with a stock price gain of over 200%. Reddit operates in a similar space as X and its clones, all of them being geeky and fundamentally text-based platforms designed for discussions, debates, rants rather than the shallow entertainment scrollfests of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. In a media landscape that is increasingly full of bots talking to other bots, Reddit’s topic-centric moderation model puts it in a good place as both a user experience and a training ground to sell on to AI platforms. AI may have taken the limelight away from headsets in recent years, but the Company Now Known As Meta continued to dive in the metaverse with a range of announcements concerning Extended Reality (XR). In this space, augmented reality (AR) has taken priority over virtual reality (VR). It seems that manufacturers have concluded VR is “cool” for games and demos, but it’s too isolating, too binary, insofar as it requires the user to don the headset and enter a separate mode of reality. You’re either in VR or you’re not. That’s similar to the experience of sitting down to use a desktop PC. In contrast, AR is more like a smartphone, and smartphones overtook PCs because you can take them anywhere and use them for tasks that are as short or as long as you wish. They’re integrated into your life rather than splitting your time into IRL and Second Life. With Oculus and Apple Vision Pro (another new product of 2024), their version of Augmented Reality is more accurately called Mixed Reality (MR). Cameras mounted on the headset give you the illusion you’re interacting with the real world while you’re in fact entirely locked inside the headset. From personal experience, both devices are getting impressively close to reality, but they still suffer from the headset form factor. You’re either in it or you’re not, and few people will dare to step in public with a $3000 machine strapped to their head. All of this makes Meta’s Orion Glasses the standout XR event of 2024. These glasses are very close to a conventional pair of specs, but true augmented reality via waveguides. The way this works is by light project directly on your retina via the glass, rather than “lighting up pixels” on the glass the way a conventional monitor or VR headset would, and more or less how Google Glass worked. Waveguides promise to deliver higher quality display while making the real world look more like the real world. Orion is still in early prototype stage, but reports from few external reviewers are optimistic, albeit on a tight set of use cases. Verge reported a game of Pong worked “surprisingly smoothly, and I noticed little to no lag in the game”. For an external Messenger call, “I could see and hear him well in the 2D window floating in front of me” . Meanwhile, Meta is pushing forward with its RayBan partnership - smart glasses with camera AI audio - which will gradually help it build up expertise in many other necessary technologies outside of the key Waveguide functionality. They appear to have avoided the stigma of Glass, and as I mentioned in my grading of 2023 predictions, they are going out of their way to force this issue early on by releasing a variant that is transparent and therefore shows the camera proudly to anyone who care. Public acceptance is vital to taking such a device mainstream and eventually replacing the smartphone. I mostly keep this blog politics-free, but can’t avoid observing the relevance of the US election to the technology sector. The next ivipresident’s inner circle now includes some of the most prominent venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The next vice-president is a former venture capitalist who ascended to politics with the help of a prominent investor and is steeped in Silicon Valley culture. All of this especially matters because the president himself has shown little interest in technology, meaning his VP and advisors will be largely running the agenda. Dominic Cummings recently remarked that Silicon Valley, for a long time enjoyed keeping their distance and not having to worry about the political class in Washington who were largely ignorant towards technology. He noted that this was no longer feasible when technology became both a major influence of political power via social media and a matter of national security as with LLMs. He also argued the EU has stifled innovation through its privacy (GDPR) and AI regulation (AI Act), something he notes has been echoed even by EU-friendly actors such as President Macron. The tech folks in the White House are likely to block and repeal most efforts towards regulation, wanting to avoid the fate of the EU and stay competitive with China. While Vance has expressed some admiration for Lina Khan’s clamping down on monopolistic practices, I don’t think this will extend to the FTC’s stance on acquisitions since there’s a view VCs and founders are being denied of an exit. Thus it seems likely the next four years will see a number of high-profile companies - private unicorns and some public small/mid caps - being acquired. There’s also concern about lagging military technology and admiration for the more modern example set by DefenseTech startups such as Anduril, which focuses on fast-moving software-first approach and billing against specs rather than hourly labour, making its work arguably more in line with the needs of its clients in the defense industry. There’s likely to be increased initiatives aiming to foster this industry. Michael is a full-stack product maker. Curious about programming, tech, startups, and future trends.

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. Table of Contents Table of Contents The battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly. Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago. Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020. Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead. To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economist What happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal. What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path. Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control. » MORE: How is the economy doing? Margarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs. What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates. » MORE: What the Fed Rate announcement means for savings accounts Sara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs. What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections. » MORE: 2024 state of consumer credit report Ryan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality. What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI. » MORE: What Trump’s win means for small businesses Holden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents' commissions. What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient. » MORE: Home sellers and buyers: What you must know for 2025 Sam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December. What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last? » MORE: 7 best-performing AI stocks Caitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insurance What happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam. What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies. » MORE: How to find the cheapest car insurance rates possible Eliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change. What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance. » MORE: Trump and student loans: What might happen and how borrowers can prepare Meghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travel What happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs. What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making. » MORE: Holiday airfare is down. Why isn’t travel spending? Laura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal finance What happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices. What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow. » MORE: Resistant to dynamic pricing? You’re likely already paying Shannon Bradley, autos writer What happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline. What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers. » MORE: Average auto loan rates by credit score Jackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases. What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing. » MORE: What is buy now, pay later? Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel. What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods. » MORE: Food prices rose 28% in 5 years. Here’s why Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease. What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built. » MORE: Rent prices keep rising amid inflation, low inventory Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses. What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. » MORE: What a Trump win means for your personal finances and the economy Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. » MORE: When will the government shut down?

It follows Apple’s release on Wednesday of its latest updates to iOS, macOS, and other devices featuring new Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comments. Apple is collaborating with Broadcom on the chip’s networking features, according to a report by The Information on Wednesday, citing sources with “direct knowledge of the project.” Code-named Baltra, the AI-focused chip is expected to enter production in 2026. Experts suggest that Apple’s collaboration with Broadcom aims to bring the server needs for its growing Apple Intelligence initiatives closer to home. “Those capabilities can actually be processed on the phone, the iPad, the Mac, independently, but in some cases, they need to go to the cloud, things like writing tools, things like summarizing text, in some cases, summarizing articles,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman told Bloomberg TV. “And for that, you need your own server infrastructure.” Founded in 1991, San Jose-based Broadcom develops semiconductor and software technologies. Its products are used in data centers, networking, and wireless communication, supporting various modern tech applications. This new collaboration is the latest in a partnership between Apple and Broadcom that began in 2023 with a multi-year deal for the chip manufacturer to develop 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. The new AI chip aims to meet the significant computing demands of Apple’s enhanced AI features while improving performance and energy efficiency. Apple’s Israel-based silicon design team will spearhead the development of the chip. Earlier this month, Apple acknowledged that its current AI-related computer chips are made through partnerships with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to support its search and Apple Intelligence programs. Others working with Apple to develop the new AI chip include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which will be responsible for mass-producing the chip. Apple’s AAPL stock rose briefly on Wednesday following the announcement of the partnership with Broadcom to $250 before falling to $247. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s AVGO stock rose 7.5% to $184.73 before slipping to $182.98 in after-hours trading.

Title: Business cycle remains a real risk for markets
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2918130/business-cycle-remains-a-real-risk-for-markets
Time Published: 2024-12-11T22:00:00Z
Full Content:
Whatever 2025 holds for world markets, talk of an end to business cycle investing eerily reflects past periods of hubris and makes all the persistent bullishness seem slightly reckless. The years since 2020 have been extraordinary, with pandemic-distorted supply and demand patterns that are still playing out. Serial geopolitical shocks and mega trends in technology and green energy have followed. Amidst all that, inflation in Western economies recorded its biggest spike in 40 years, and central banks scrambled to snuff it out with the most brutal credit tightening in decades. But setting aside the deep but brief pandemic-induced economic contraction in early 2020, the United States has managed to avoid a recession. And few if any forecasters see one unfolding next year. For BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, it is simply different this time. "We've argued since 2020 that we are not in a business cycle," it said in its 2025 outlook. "Historical trends are being permanently broken in real time as mega forces, like the rise of artificial intelligence, transform economies." Ignoring the business cycle is a big call and certainly a brave one at this stage. Yet, looking at the United States over the past few years, it's hard to argue against it. Previously near foolproof bellwethers of cyclical downturns, such as the inverted yield curve or the 'Sahm Rule' on when rising joblessness presages a downturn -- have flashed bright red, but to no avail. US real GDP has expanded continuously since a one-quarter contraction in the first three months of 2022 and as 2024 comes to a close, growth rates are still well above trend at more than 3%. If anything, that looks set to be underscored by both lower interest rates and tax cuts next year. Even the most dogged bears on Wall Street have thrown in the towel, seemingly assured that the services-dominated US economy can sail on unfettered. Most of the big brokers expect further punchy gains for Wall Street stocks in 2025. The already expensive S&P 500, still led mostly by a narrow group of mega-cap tech giants, is set to record its second consecutive year of 25%-plus gains for the first time since 1998. RESONATING MILESTONES All the same, comparisons to the late 1990s should ring some alarm bells. The final years on the last century were certainly different to today but there are also uncanny parallels with the present, including mounting euphoria about a US-dominated technology, a turbulent world economy and seemingly Teflon US growth. The end of the Cold War had given rise to many hubristic books, most famously Francis Fukuyama's bestseller The End of History and the Last Man on the durable triumph of liberal democracy. By the end of the decade, the internet bubble gave vent to endless talk about business cycle being transcended in the face of transformative technology and US exceptionalism. What's more, there were also a few hesitant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts that kept the expansion going before eventually being reversed as the economy dodged turbulence abroad and the domestic bubble grew bigger. The upshot? A tech-led bubble burst in 2000, ushering in three years of consecutive S&P 500 losses -- the longest series of annual downturns since World War II. It took seven years to recover the peaks of 2000, just before the banking crash hit. To be sure, anyone who stuck with durable tech names that survived the dot.com bust made a fortune over the past 20 years. But the business and investment cycle was far from ending. TEFLON ECONOMY So what could go wrong now? Even if there is a cogent argument for continued US economic and market outperformance next year, it's hard to see how America remains entirely insulated if there is significant economic weakness overseas. Asset managers' 2025 outlooks all dwell heavily on the uncertainties surrounding the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump. And they all acknowledge that some type of trade war is in the offing, with China, Europe and even US neighbours Canada and Mexico all in the crosshairs. A global economic hit from tit-for-tat tariff salvos and investment curbs could come back to haunt the United States if it stymies world demand or lifts US prices, causing the Fed to halt or reverse its policy easing. BlackRock's view, for the record, is that the US and global economies may well experience bouts of turbulence in the coming year. But their conclusion is that such moves would only impact tactical trades and that major investment decisions should stay focused on multi-year big themes, such as artificial intelligence and green energy. But even if the United States can remain an "oasis of prosperity", in the words of another famed phrase from the late 1990s, financial distortions could eventually sow the seeds of an eventual fall. Monetary easing around the world has already accelerated, potentially in response to trade fears. This is buoying the dollar and holding down US Treasury yields, too, as investors rotate into what's now become a high-yielding "safe asset". Some argue that inappropriately low US long-term borrowing rates could, by themselves, catalyse a downfall by overheating the economy and further inflating asset bubbles. That scenario suggests that any downturn likely wouldn't come next year. But the rumoured death of the business cycle may yet prove to be greatly exaggerated.

Title: Sonos plans return-to-office push for its product teams
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24314934/sonos-return-to-office-mandate
Time Published: 2024-12-11T21:35:45Z

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos will soon encourage employees on its various product teams who live near its US office locations to come in for at least two days per week, The Verge has learned. That’s a notable break from the company’s history, throughout which Sonos has enthusiastically supported fully remote and hybrid work. Job listings at Sonos routinely state that “it’s about impact, not location.” Glassdoor reviews have long backed this up, with employees reporting no pressure to come into the office. But that lax stance is set to change slightly as Sonos continues its effort to right the ship following this year’s app mishap and stay on track with upcoming products. It’s adopting a stricter policy that will call for product employees within proximity of Santa Barbara, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco to regularly be present at those offices. The Santa Barbara location is where Sonos is headquartered. The company also currently operates international offices in Paris and the Netherlands “Flexibility has been a core tenet of how Sonos has operated since our founding. Flexibility is not going away, but like many companies, we are evaluating the impact that in-person collaboration has on the effectiveness of our teams and our culture,” Sonos said in a statement provided by spokesperson Olivia Singer. Do you know more about what’s ahead at Sonos? The company is rumored to be working on a video streaming box. As with headphones, I’m curious how Sonos plans to differentiate itself in this category. If you have anything to share on what’s happening at the company, I can be reached securely (and confidentially) via Signal at chriswelch.01 or (845) 445-8455. “Sonos product teams rely heavily on collaboration, collective problem-solving, and hands-on testing. These are activities which we believe can be done more effectively in-person. We will be prioritizing office space for our product teams to collaborate in-person 2+ days per week depending on location (proximity to office), role, and current needs. Many Sonos employees and teams, however, will see no change to their current work situation.” Employees at Sonos tell me that morale remains low internally — it’s been that way since the app controversy spiraled into a crisis — with some fearing another wave of layoffs in the coming weeks after 100 employees were cut back in April. New job postings from the company have been extremely thin in recent weeks as Sonos tightens its belt amid sluggish demand. During last month’s quarterly earnings call, CEO Patrick Spence and CFO Saori Casey said Sonos will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the balance sheet where it needs to be as the audio company navigates a challenging period for its business. Those measures already include leaning more heavily on AI to field customer support requests. The new Sonos Arc Ultra has received positive reviews across the board, including from yours truly. But a single product hasn’t gone far in convincing rank-and-file employees (or the company’s most ardent customers) that Sonos is back on the right trajectory for the long haul. Return-to-office mandates have become common across the tech industry; many large companies require employees to badge in at least three days each week. Amazon made waves earlier this year when it announced a return to the traditional five-day office work week. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Tech's seven trillion-dollar companies added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. For Alphabet, the two-day 11% rally was driven by the company's launch of its latest quantum computing chip, which it revealed on Monday and described as a "breakthrough" and "an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications" in drug discovery, battery design and other areas. Alphabet closed at $195.40 on Wednesday, topping its prior high of $191.18, which it reached on July 10. Tesla had been below its previous record for much longer. Shares of the electric vehicle maker jumped almost 6% on Wednesday to $424.77, climbing above their prior closing high of $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021. The stock has soared 69% since Donald Trump's election victory last month, on Wall Street's optimism that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's cozy relationship with the incoming president will pay dividends. Amazon, Apple and Meta have all been regularly reaching new highs, though Apple slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Microsoft, meanwhile, is about 4% below its high reached in July, and chipmaker Nvidia is 6% off its record from last month. The outsized weighting of tech's megacaps has pushed the Nasdaq to a 33% gain for the year. The index rose 1.8% on Wednesday to close at an all-time high of 20,034.89. The market has rallied since Trump's victory on Nov. 4, partly on expectations that the new administration will dial down regulatory pressure on the tech industry and allow for more dealmaking. On Tuesday, Trump named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission, replacing Lina Khan, who is best known for blocking the top tech companies' acquisition efforts. Ferguson, currently one of the FTC's five commissioners, "will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's "Closing Bell" that investors see more gains in tech with the expectation that a Federal Reserve rate cut is coming this month. The consumer price index showed a 12-month inflation rate of 2.7% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday, further solidifying the market outlook for a cut. "We know that when interest rates fall, the megacaps actually are very sensitive to that, and I think today was a day where the odds of a December cut increased," Lee said. "That's actually bullish for tech." WATCH: What Fundstrat's Tom Lee expects from the markets in 2025 Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

getty Many investors are optimistic heading into 2025, and for good reason. In the U.S., interest rates are expected to fall, GDP growth has been stable and the incoming president is decidedly pro-business. Optimism can favor growth stocks—that is, until the sentiment changes. And when that change happens, you will be thrilled to have some protective value stock exposure. Value stocks, in theory, have lower downside risk because they are already priced at or below their intrinsic value. Expensive growth stocks, on the other hand, have ample room for price declines. I scouted six value stocks that could be candidates for your portfolio in 2025. Read on to meet these stocks and learn the screening criteria we used to find them. To identify the best value stocks with low price points, reasonable debt loads, good liquidity and recent earnings and cash flow growth, I set these parameters: Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. The table below introduces six value stocks that met the criteria outlined above. For more investing ideas, see picks for small cap value stocks and the best value stocks for 2024. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Let's explore each of these companies in more detail below. Metrics are from Stockanalysis.com. Halliburton provides support services to oil and gas companies around the world. The company's service set addresses all phases of reservoir management, including exploration, production and wind-down. HAL has had a tough year. The stock price peaked in April and then fell more than 20%. Contributing to the decline was a cybersecurity attack that made headlines in late August. The attack has reportedly cost the company at least $35 million. Despite the data breach and stock price volatility, analysts remain optimistic about the oil and gas service provider. The average price target from 18 analysts is about 38% higher than HAL's current stock price. Factors behind the optimism include: KSPI manages an application that integrates payments, e-commerce, banking and lending. The Kazakhstan-based company began trading on the Nasdaq in January 2024. Over the past five years, KSPI has shown solid topline and bottom-line growth. In 2024, the company rapidly expanded its user base and acquired a large stake in the dominant Turkish e-commerce company Hepsiburada. The acquisition aligns with KSPI's long-term goal of expanding its addressable market to 100 million users. KSPI has an impressive history of leveraging its engaged customer base to launch new services. Kaspi's grocery delivery service, for example, launched in 2022 and now has an active customer base of 725,000. The company is also seeing momentum in other new offerings, including travel and tours booking, personalized gift cards and deposit services for merchants. Coterra explores and produces oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the U.S. The company owns assets in Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Coterra recently announced its intention to acquire assets from Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources. Both acquisitions expand the company's position in the Permian Basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico. The two deals should enhance Coterra's profitability in the region and diversify its revenue. The company also recently announced three new long-term international LNG agreements. These will further diversify revenue starting in 2027. The deals should add to the momentum Coterra is already achieving organically. In its last quarterly release, the company raised its production guidance for 2024 oil, natural gas and BOE. The midpoint of the 2024 oil guidance now equals 12% growth and is 5% higher than the outlook provided last February.

UGP is a Brazilian holding company that provides distribution, transportation, technology and storage services in the energy sector. UGP's subsidiaries are Hidrovias do Brasil, Ultragaz, Ultracargo and Ipiranga. UGP currently trades in penny-stock territory at roughly $3 per share. At that price, the stock is easy to buy and sell—which, unfortunately, encourages volatility. Investors have not been patient with the Brazilian company this year, either. The stock eclipsed $6 per share in February but has trended down since due to underperformance in the first two quarters. The falling stock price raises UGP's dividend yield above 4% and lowers its valuation metrics. This could be an attractive buying opportunity if UGP can leverage its size across different markets. According to Insider Monkey, the company has 19% market share in vehicle fuel distribution in Brazil and operates one of the country's largest LPG distribution networks. Ezcorp operates pawn shops in the U.S. and Latin America. The company provides collateralized loans and buys merchandise from consumers for resale. Ezcorp regularly outperforms analysts' expectations for earnings and revenue. Through acquisitions and organic growth, the company has increased its store count by roughly 20% since fiscal year 2020. Today, Ezcorp operates 1,279 pawn stores, including 20 Latin America locations added in fiscal 2024. The company also recently announced the acquisition of a 53-store chain in Mexico. The pawn shop operator recently reported record annual revenue and pawn loans outstanding (PLO) for fiscal year 2024, which ended on September 30. Revenues increased 11% to $1.2 billion, and PLO grew 12% to $274.1 million. Diluted earnings per share also rose 20%. Ultralife designs, makes, installs and sells batteries, communications systems and related accessories. The company serves customers in multiple industries, including government, defense, medical, security, industrial and energy. Like other low-priced stocks on this list, ULBI has been volatile in 2024. The stock hit a high in May before dropping more than 40% to its current price of about $7.70. There was a small run in early November, but it was reversed by a disappointing earnings report. ULBI's third-quarter revenue and earnings fell due to order timing and supply chain issues. The good news is that ULBI is a leader in the design and manufacture of in-demand lithium-ion batteries. McKinsey predicts demand for lithium-ion batteries will rise by 27% annually through 2030—Ultralife will benefit from that growth. The company also maintains good expense and capital allocation discipline under CEO Michael Manna. Over the past year, Ultralife repaid over half its long-term debt and improved gross margin by over 100 basis points relative to year-end 2023 results. The best stocks aren't always the most popular ones. An overlooked value stock with solid fundamentals and a healthy balance sheet could deliver the exposure you need as we march forward optimistically into the new year.

Title: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Play Raises Questions About Nasdaq 100 Inclusion

(Bloomberg) -- Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc. checks all the boxes for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a development that would trigger purchases of the shares by the $451 billion worth of exchange-traded funds around the world that directly track the benchmark. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters American Institute of Architects CEO Resigns Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Dream San Francisco, Paris Named Best Cities for Urban Transportation City Hall Is Hiring Yet market watchers are entertaining the possibility it gets snubbed in the index’s annual reshuffling on Friday for one simple reason: MicroStrategy has morphed into a levered bet on Bitcoin attached to a small software company that many say has no business being among the 100 most-important stocks on the Nasdaq. “The idea of an index is it’s supposed to really represent faithfully the body of stocks that are in the universe,” said TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, who has a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy. “Any large company that makes up a material portion of the Nasdaq universe should be reflected as being in the index.” Shares of the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm co-founded by Saylor have mesmerized Wall Street this year by surging more than 500% as the company accelerates an unconventional plan to raise capital solely to purchase and hold more Bitcoin. It has announced multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the cryptocurrency every Monday over the past five weeks. With the token’s price reaching all-time highs recently, MicroStrategy now holds more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin. But its underlying business had a net loss of $340 million in third quarter of this year. Still, the company’s $98 billion market capitalization, which would make it roughly the 40th biggest stock in the Nasdaq 100, is largely based on its Bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy, and this could factor into whether the stock is added to the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq could use the small size of MicroStrategy’s operating business as a reason not to add the company to the index, Vitanza said. However, that would be counterintuitive since the company’s market capitalization is so large, he added. ‘Bitcoin Treasury Company’ MicroStrategy’s software business offers it a benefit when it comes to inclusion in the Nasdaq benchmark, as financial companies are ineligible for the Nasdaq 100. MicroStrategy has called itself a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” but since its revenue comes from its software business, it is classified as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark, making it fair game for the index. The ICB could choose to reclassify MicroStrategy as a financial stock during the next change in March, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, said that MicroStrategy is now more similar to a commodity or an ETF since it is “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin. He thinks it should be reclassified as a financial-company next year. “One hundred percent of the value of the company is Bitcoin because the rest of the company is potentially a negative,” Lebowitz said in an interview. “A large majority of the company is just purely its Bitcoin holdings and the financial machinations around it, so it is a financial company.” Nonetheless, should it be added to the index, it would “introduce the potential for very large amounts of passive inflows into MicroStrategy shares and could provide a boost to its stock,” said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who also has a “buy” recommendation on the stock. MicroStrategy aims to raise $42 billion in capital from equity and fixed income securities offerings over the next three years, and has already surpassed its 2025 goal for equity. An increase in its stock price from inclusion in the index would help the company issue stock at premium and support its overall strategy of purchasing more Bitcoin, Palmer said. The increase in trading of the shares should the company be added to the index might not make a big difference to its liquidity, but it would bring in new investors, TD’s Vitanza said. “If you think about the liquidity in the stock and the volume of shares that trade, it’s not all that much,” Vitanza said. “But it will be new pockets of capital, so I think that the people that are going to wind up owning the stock on the other end of the index are clearly different people that are buying stock in the at-the-market” price. Joining the broader US benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, would be a different story. The S&P 500 considers the profitability of new additions to its index, which could be a barrier for MicroStrategy, which has posted net losses for three of the past four quarters. “The fact that they are not a traditional operating company in the traditional sense of the way that we describe that, I think, has much more of a bearing on the S&P 500 than it does in the Nasdaq 100,” Vitanza said. The Nasdaq index has long differentiated itself from the S&P 500 by focusing on non-financial companies, and only those listed on Nasdaq. The exchange itself has launched its own digital-asset products, offering a software platform for crypto exchanges to go to market. Palantir Technologies Inc. and Axon Enterprise Inc. could also be added to the Nasdaq 100, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Changes to the index will take effect on Dec. 23.

Title: Why EOG Resources (EOG) Is One of the Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks to Invest in?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to look at where EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) stands against other most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. On November 4, the Canadian government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced preliminary regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the oil and gas sector by 35% from 2019 levels over the next eight years. These regulations are set to be implemented through a cap-and-trade system, which will establish a legal limit on the sector’s emissions, allowing companies to buy and sell a limited number of emissions allowances. The cap is expected to be enforced starting in 2030, with gradual reductions until Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan is set to be finalized in the coming year and phased in starting in 2026. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has expressed concerns that the cap will lead to production cuts and a reduction in business investment. The effectiveness and implementation of this policy remains uncertain, as the governing Liberal Party faces a significant challenge from the Conservative Party, which is leading in the polls ahead of the next election, scheduled no later than October 2026.

In an interview with CNBC on September 11, Katie Stockton, Founder of Fairlead Strategies discussed the potential for a natural gas trade as the market shows signs of basing and improving momentum. Stockton began by noting that natural gas prices have experienced a significant decline, with a 75% drop from September 2022. This dramatic decrease has put natural gas in a long-term downtrend, making it a challenging and volatile asset to trade. One of the key indicators Stockton highlighted is the long-term momentum gauge for natural gas prices. For the first time since the beginning of 2023, this gauge has flipped to a buy signal, indicating a significant shift in the long-term trend. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the downward momentum may be reversing. Additionally, natural gas has been showing signs of basing for several months, which is a positive signal for potential upside movement. Stockton also pointed out that short-term momentum has been improving. Natural gas futures have recently moved above their 50-day moving average, a key technical level that often signals short-term strength. The prices are now testing the 200-day moving average, another critical resistance level. Breaking through this level could trigger more buying interest and potentially lead to a sustained upward trend. Natural gas has become a key part of the world’s energy supply, serving as a bridge between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. This increased demand is expected to help stabilize prices and open up new opportunities for investors. To compile our list of the 8 most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest gas companies. We shortlisted companies with a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% and a minimum net income of $1 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM) as informed by SeekingAlpha. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 46 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 19.01% TTM Net Income: $7.14 Billion EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was established in 1985 and is based in Houston, Texas. The company along with its subsidiaries, engages in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, primarily in active basins within the United States, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and other international locations. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is making strategic infrastructure investments that are designed to ensure that the company can capitalize on the growing demand for North American natural gas. The company is building the Janus gas plant in the Delaware Basin, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Furthermore, the company has completed the Verde pipeline, which will be primarily used to transport natural gas extracted from the Dorado play in South Texas to the Agua Dulce hub in Texas to allow the company to access the Gulf Coast market. The company is optimistic that new LNG projects, exports to Mexico, and increased power generation will drive about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day of new LNG capacity starting in 2025 and continuing through 2027. To capitalize on this trend, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) in 2022, announced to drill 25 wells using two rigs in the Dorado area, which is part of the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations. However, during the Q3 earnings call, management informed that the company now plans to continue a one-rig program in the Dorado area to improve efficiency and deepen its understanding of the play. The company estimates that Dorado holds about 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas with a production cost of less than $1.25 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Overall, EOG ranks 3rd on our list of one of the most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of EOG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India’s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman’s prime brokerage trading desk. Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide.

To compile our list of the 10 best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used Clean Energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 alternative fuel stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

(NYSE:GEV) is a prominent manufacturer and service provider in the energy equipment sector. The company’s portfolio includes the Power segment, which specializes in gas turbines and services; the Electrification segment, which focuses on grid solutions and power conversion; and the Wind segment, which encompasses both onshore and offshore wind solutions. GE Vernova Inc.’s (NYSE:GEV) technology supports approximately 55,000 wind turbines and 7,000 gas turbines operating across more than 100 countries. GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is actively expanding its manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for gas turbines, particularly in Aeroderivative and Heavy-Duty Gas Turbines, which provide efficient power and flexible fuel options. The company plans to deliver between 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines annually starting in 2026, up from 55 in recent years. This expansion is driven by the increasing demand from hyperscalers and the need for baseload power in data center parks. Moreover, GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is implementing lean manufacturing practices across its operations to improve quality, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. For example, the heavy-duty gas turbine team has enhanced standard work processes, resulting in a 20% improvement in quality control. Additionally, the company is leveraging lean principles to double the manufacturing output of its power transmission business with minimal capital expenditure, primarily through better asset and labor utilization. Overall, GEV ranks 1st on our list of one of the best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Elon Musk is on the weight-loss drug bandwagon
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-1851718915
Time Published: 2024-12-11T19:27:42Z

Elon Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is doubling down on his support for expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,” Musk wrote Wednesday morning in a post on X, the social media site he owns. GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment, Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.39%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has turned Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.74%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. This isn’t Musk’s first time expressing his support for the use of these popular treatments. In 2022, he posted on X that he had used Wegovy. Recently, he agreed with Sen. Bernie Sanders’s efforts to bring down the costs of expensive GLP-1 drugs. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk wrote in a post in September. The remarks were made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany, and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen in September during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) regarding what the company charges in the U.S. for its blockbuster drugs.

Title: ‘There’s no sugar-coating it, this isn’t easy’, Dublin chef Gaz Smith speaks of battle to save ‘Big Mike’s’ restaurant

Gareth 'Gaz' Smith Well-known Dublin chef Gareth ‘Gaz’ Smith has said his popular Blackrock restaurant Big Mike’s is continuing on despite financial difficulties and the jobs of his employees “are secure”. A notice on the Big Mike’s website noted that a “process adviser” had been appointed to the company behind the restaurant. The appointment of a process adviser is part of the Small Company Administrative Rescue Process (SCARP). In order for a company to avail of the scheme, it must be “fundamentally viable and capable of trading its way out of its current difficulties,” according to the Department of Enterprise. Under the scheme, the process adviser is tasked with putting together a rescue plan for the business and working with creditors to consolidate debts. Mr Smith has confirmed the restaurant started the SCARP process and said there is “a really strong business model in place”. He said the team at Big Mike’s is moving forward “with their head high and chests out”. “We’re three weeks into the seven-week Government SCARP process, and things are progressing well,” Mr Smith said in a statement. "Our ambitious project resulted in huge fit out costs from Covid days (when materials costs were 4-5 times the norm) and we’ve tried our very best to maintain those repayments out of cash flow, and we need a pressure release from that. As confirmed by the comprehensive SCARP report. “We’ve a really strong business model in place with options and support in the background. Jobs are secure, vouchers will be honoured, suppliers have been incredible, and our team is moving forward with their heads high and chests out.” Mr Smith said “it would be irresponsible” for him as an employer “not to do everything in my power” to keep staff on the restaurant’s payroll rather than the Government’s He said there has been “exceptional” engagement and good faith from all parties involved, including Revenue, lenders, suppliers, and the process facilitators, and this is the reason the business is already halfway through the SCARP process. “There’s no sugarcoating it – this isn’t easy – but it’s a lot better than the alternative. We’re staying focused, proactive, and optimistic about the future,” he added. “Very often the whispers are ten times worse than the truth, we’ve been incredibly transparent with everybody and everybody has shown incredible support, we’re very grateful for the goodwill.” In July of this year, Mr Smith confirmed the closure of his Mount Merrion-based restaurant Michael’s in order to concentrate his business on Big Mike’s, with staff from Michael’s taking up positions at the Blackrock location.

Title: Why Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 202 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. While it relies primarily on its search engine and advertising to account for nearly 70% of its revenue, the firm also plays a key role in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business. Waymo is one of the few companies in the US whose cars regularly travel on roads to finetune their self-driving capabilities. Yet, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Waymo have also been dealt setbacks from the inherent risks of autonomous driving platforms being vulnerable to accidents. On the flip side, Waymo’s prowess with self-driving also provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a commanding position in a market that can grow in the future. As a whole, the narrative depends on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s dominance in the search engine market and its ability to fend off any legal troubles that might head its way. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India’s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025.

On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman’s prime brokerage trading desk. Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide. To compile our list of the 10 best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used Clean Energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 alternative fuel stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

Title: Elon Musk is so rich he makes Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg look poor

Time Published: 2024-12-11T18:19:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk was already the richest person on the planet. Now, thanks to Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX’s surging valuations, he’s worth more than $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations. Specifically, he’s worth $439.2 billion. For reference, the next richest men alive are Amazon (AMZN-0.85%) founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, Meta (META-1.92%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle (ORCL-1.84%) Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. They’re worth, respectively, $244 billion, $219 billion, and $197 billion. Musk is also at least as wealthy as Mansa Musa, the emperor of the West African Mali Empire and previous record holder of richest man to ever live, who historians estimate was worth around $400 billion, according to the BBC. The impetus for Musk’s latest surge in wealth is SpaceX’s newfound value of $350 billion, which makes it the most valuable startup in the world. On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to buy $1.25 billion of shares from employees and company insiders. “What’s really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation! SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in,” Musk wrote on his X Wednesday. Besides SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and owner of X. Corp. His other companies include artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip firm Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company. xAI, recently raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation less than two years after he founded it. That’s also more than double its valuation in May, when it was valued at $24 billion at a value of $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Musk owns more than 13% of Tesla shares, which have surged since President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The stock climbed to a new record of $415 per share on Wednesday, narrowly surpassing its prior record for intraday trading of $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk has said that ending those credits will hurt Tesla’s rivals more than it damages his company, although analysts expect some downside in the short term. Several analysts have also raised their price targets for the stock in recent days as they look to catch up with the stock surge, often pointing to Tesla’s plans for driverless vehicles and humanoid robots.

Title: Picking an EV can be overwhelming. 5 factors can inform your purchase — and help you save.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-vehicle-guide-expert-advice-buying-charging-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-12-11T17:51:05Z

If you're considering an electric vehicle for your next car, there are various factors — like your anticipated daily mileage and charging needs — to consider. Before buying, you may also want to think about EVs that are eligible for tax credits, which can lower the cost of your overall purchase. Whether you go with a fully electric or hybrid model, there are plenty of new, used, and coming versions of this more sustainable car type to choose from. In "Getting Ready for Electric," a series of shopping guides, Business Insider has been exploring the ins and outs of EV purchasing. Read on for the best tips for shopping for your next EV. Battery ranges can vary depending on your driving habits and the climate of where you live. While driving a few dozen miles daily in a moderate climate like Florida could open a buyer to a wide variety of EV options, someone who drives hundreds of miles daily and lives in a locale prone to colder temperatures may have fewer options overall, Scott Case, a cofounder and the CEO of Recurrent, a startup that tracks EV-battery health, previously told BI. Newer models tend to accommodate long-haul driving needs better than older models, but they usually have higher price tags. The federal government offers tax incentives on certain EVs, while some states have rebate programs that can lower the cost of your purchase. Each of these discount methods has its own requirements and varies for new versus used EVs. For example, to get a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, your new EV must have: If you meet some but not all of the requirements, you may qualify for a smaller tax credit. When it comes to used EVs, you may be eligible for a tax credit — 30% of the vehicle price, up to $4,000 — if you have: For the EV-curious who don't want to pay for a yearslong commitment, the leasing approach could be the way to go. Unlike bought EVs, leased ones fall into a different tax-incentive category because they don't undergo the same complex parts-sourcing process and don't have the same income caps. Because of this distinction, dealerships get a $7,500 federal tax credit for each of their EVs. That's where the EV-leasing loophole comes in: Many dealerships are opting to pass these credits onto their lessees. That extra cash, bumper-to-bumper coverage, and the ability to return the car at the lease's end are benefits worth considering when shopping. The Department of Energy reported that there are more than 61,000 EV charging stations nationwide, double the number in 2020. The majority of Americans — 95%, a Pew Research Center study found — live in counties with at least one of these stations. If you're close to one of these stations, an EV could be a convenient and inexpensive alternative to a gas-powered car. Though more of an investment, at-home EV chargers can make your green-car purchase that much more worthwhile, Jenni Newman, the editor in chief of Cars.com and an EV owner, previously told BI. Not all public charging ports are compatible with all EV car models, and drivers have reported coming across broken chargers. An at-home charging setup could eliminate those issues. EV owners can charge their cars within hours or overnight — a slower method that can prolong battery life — and end up with 250 to 300 miles of driving range without leaving their driveways. These setups range in cost — from $250 to $7,000 — depending on your outlet location, the voltage your electric panel can support, and the speed at which you want to charge your vehicle. Like with buying or leasing an EV, there are charger tax credits available from the federal government. As automakers adjust their EV-manufacturing strategies, they're investing in more hybrid EVs and models at lower price points. Because of these strategic changes in the car industry, you can expect a bigger menu of EV options for both fully electric and hybrid cars. Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s December Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) stands against other stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the evolution of AI and how the technology has come from being ignored as “hype” to now completely changing everyday lives for many. Cramer mentioned the AI solutions offered by Marc Benioff’s company and said the technology is actually exceeding expectations “dramatically.” [read Marc Benioff’s latest comments here] Cramer mentioned the comments of Benioff on his company’s new AI-powered solutions: “Suddenly, though, we have Agent Force, and with it, Marc said, I quote, “We’re unleashing this new year of digital labor force for every business and every industry.” He went on to say, quote, “The implications are just simply profound. Now people ridicule me for saying how much we need AI, but Marc says, quote, ‘For decades, economic growth depended on expanding the human workforce. It was all about getting more labor,’ end quote. Not anymore—not with agents powered by AI who, as you’re stating, can work faster, doing tedious things but essential jobs that nobody wants. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he was talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Talking about CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Jim Cramer said in a recent program on CNBC that he’s waiting to see where the stock bottoms and said he sees “maybe” another bad quarter for the company. “I’ve been waiting to see where it could bottom, and Deutsche Banks taking the leap might be a little too early because there could be one more bad quarter. But it’s worth talking about, and I think it’s good. It’s better than Honeywell, which is down five, because they don’t know how to tell the story.” Cramer said CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) new CEO David Joyner is doing a “good job.” What ails CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is the rising competition. CVS has expanded beyond retail, particularly after acquiring Aetna in 2018, but retail and pharmacy sales still account for around 50% of its total revenue. The pharmacy services segment is facing growing competition from non-traditional retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Costco, as well as from new disruptors like Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon, which has expanded into healthcare and pharmaceutical sales. Retail margins are also under pressure, with competitors offering cheaper prescriptions and household goods. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) market share in pharmacy services has only grown modestly, from 23.8% in 2017 to 25.7% in 2023, despite significant acquisitions. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has spent $96.6 billion on deals like Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street Health. Meanwhile, CVS’s long-term debt has risen sharply, from $25.1 billion in 2017 to $65 billion, and shares outstanding have grown at an annual rate of 3.5%. Coho Relative Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “While we believe each of those companies is performing in line with or better than our expectations and that the moves lower are unjustified, both CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Nike reported disappointing performance in recent results. In CVS’ case, management gave an optimistic outlook to 2024 at its December Investor Day, which we believed was consistent with our expectations. Unfortunately, management misestimated its medical loss ratio and the anticipated profitability in its book for Medicare Advantaged lives. This triggered a position paper violation, as the company’s financial flexibility now looks constrained in both 2024 and 2025.” Overall, CVS ranks 4th on our list of stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Class-action lawsuit against microchip company Nvidia to proceed, Supreme Court says

Double your support for intelligent, in-depth, trustworthy journalism. Associated Press Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court’s decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia’s bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. READ MORE: Supreme Court hears arguments on study requirements for environmental regulators In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia’s recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. On December 10, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar discussed the potential for charging business users thousands of dollars per month for its AI software to better reflect its value. She explained that for users, such as lawyers or academics, AI tools could function like having a highly skilled assistant, making a higher subscription fee reasonable. Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures semiconductor devices, offering processes for logic, mixed-signal, and embedded memory technologies used in AI applications. Its products support high-performance computing, automotive, IoT, and consumer electronics, driving advancements in AI hardware and processing. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) saw a 34% increase in sales in November, continuing strong growth driven by demand for AI hardware. The company’s sales for October and November rose 31.4%, and analysts expect a 36.3% growth for the quarter, as per a Bloomberg report.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies.

On December 10, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar discussed the potential for charging business users thousands of dollars per month for its AI software to better reflect its value. She explained that for users, such as lawyers or academics, AI tools could function like having a highly skilled assistant, making a higher subscription fee reasonable. Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: Is SoFi Technologies (SOFI) the Worst ARK Stock to Buy According to Short Sellers?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Worst ARK Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) stands against other worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. Cathie Wood of ARK Investment is one of Wall Street’s most well-known hedge fund bosses. In a hedge fund industry dominated by players that focus on quantitative trading, value stocks, and balanced portfolios, Wood stands out from the pack by focusing on disruptive innovation and firms that she and her firm believe will change the world. This relentless focus on change means that if the economy is facing turbulence, then markets are not kind to Wood. To understand how: consider the cumulative value of her firm’s holdings as indicated by its 13F SEC filings. Starting from Q3 2020, analyzing the value for each subsequent year’s third quarter reveals how Ark Invest’s fortune fluctuates with economic winds. The hedge fund’s holdings were valued at $16.8 billion, $41.6 billion, $14.3 billion, and $13 billion during Q3 2020, Q3 2021, Q3 2022, and Q3 2023, respectively. This shows that the value of Ark Invest’s holdings jumped by 148% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021. Looking back to see why, market conditions back then were marked by easy liquidity, a surge in retail investing, and Wall Street’s bullishness for technology stocks. Technology and growth stocks are precisely the kinds that Wood invests in, and in the time period being analyzed, the shares of Elon Musk’s car company alone soared by 87%. Wood is one of the firm’s largest investors, and her patience has yielded results. Insider Monkey’s data shows that Ark Invest first bought the shares at an average price of $13.14 during Q4 2016. While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%. For our list of the worst Ark stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the 110 largest holdings in Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 SEC filings by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the highest percentage. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 13.70% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 31 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $99.1 million SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a sizable financial services provider based in San Francisco, California. It provides lending services, financial technology products, and benefits management products among others. The firm depends heavily on interest income to fund its operations. As of H1 2024, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) earned $1.3 billion in interest income and $428 million in noninterest income. Consequently, a lower interest rate environment could play out in its favor as services such as loan refinancing, mortgages, and personal loans see greater demand from consumers. The bulk of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s interest income is from loans, and the firm’s noninterest income comes from various areas such as its technology platforms. In H1, income from technology platforms grew by 11% to somewhat mitigate the effects of a 48% drop in loan origination income due to high interest rates. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s management commented on its outlook of a relaxed regulatory environment during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We’ve achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Overall, SOFI ranks 9th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of SOFI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOFI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:NTLA) is another genomic stock. The firm is developing treatments for diseases such as angioedema, lung ailments, hemophilia, and others. Since Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) does not sell any drugs in the market, under-development treatments are crucial to the firm’s hypothesis. Two of its leading drug candidates are NTLA-2002 and NTLA-2001. These drugs target angioedema and cardiomyopathy, respectively. They are currently in Phase 2 trials and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is enrolling patients for NTLA-2002’s Phase 3 trials. The firm’s shares are down 52% year-to-date, but the two drugs will enter Phase 3 trials soon to further create certainty around Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s portfolio. Additionally, the firm also has other drugs such as NTLA-3001 in its portfolio which creates additional room to get a drug to the market. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s management commented on its under-development drugs during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “In October, at The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting, we presented unprecedented positive results from our Phase II study of NTLA-2002 for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema. These results showed that a simple one-time infusion of NTLA-2002 offers patients the potential for a functional cure. For people living with HAE, current treatment options are limited to chronically administered prophylactic therapies to prevent or manage attacks, and the use of on-demand therapy to control breakthrough attacks. Overall, NTLA ranks 6th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NTLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Tesla stock's post-election boom just powered the shares to an all-time high

Tesla stock beat its previous all-time high Wednesday, as investors and analysts foresee major gains from self-driving vehicles, robots, and CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with the next president. The stock has been a tear over the last month after Donald Trump won the presidential election, aided by Musk’s generous spending. The stock climbed to a new record of $424.88 per share before closing at $424.77 on Wednesday. In pre-market trading Thursday, the stock is slightly up, bringing the price to almost $426 a pop. The previous record for intraday trading was $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. Trading closed that day at $409.97, which was the stock’s split-adjusted all-time closing high. “As foretold in the prophecy, Musk wrote in a post on his X Wednesday afternoon as the stock hit $420 a share. In 2018, he said he was considering taking Tesla private at that price, which is a marijuana reference. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. But Tesla will likely face a hit in sales if the credits are nixed and the company’s technology isn’t ready to take advantage of eased regulatory changes concerning driverless cars, according to experts. Tesla has also benefitted from a number of positive analyst reactions to the stock surge, with many raising their price targets. Morgan Stanley’s (MS-0.32%) Adam Jonas joined the party on Tuesday, adding Tesla as a “top pick” and raising the firm’s price target to $400 per share from $310. He warned that killing the EV tax credit could slow adoption and that “higher competition with tariff hikes are an inflationary wild-card.” Goldman Sachs (GS-0.67%) on Wednesday raised its price target to $345 from $250, noting that it expects Tesla to face near-to-medium term headwinds to its auto businesses. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Andres Sheppard raised the firm’s price target to $365 per share from $255, citing bullishness on Tesla’s robotaxi plans and a potential federal framework for self-driving vehicles. Bank of America (BAC-0.98%) analysts, who raised their price target to $400 per share from $350, pointed to a recent visit to Tesla’s Texas factory, which gave them “increased confidence” in Tesla’s core EV businesses and the Optimus humanoid robots. Musk has been forecasting an eventual price of $250,00 to $30,000 per robot, as well as a long-term scenario where they add $20 trillion to the company’s market capitalization. Tesla’s market capitalization was almost $1.3 trillion as of Wednesday. Wall Street analysts are “tripping over each other” to raise their price targets, wrote The Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black on Tuesday, pointing to a chart showing that the average price target is still $260 per share. “How does a highly paid WS sales team get on the phone and tell clients to buy a stock with little or no upside?” He also raised his price target — to $380 per share from $300 — on Monday, citing his “increased conviction” that Tesla will launch an affordable electric hatchback in 2025. While some analysts have expressed caution over aspects of Tesla’s business, others have gone a bit further to dampen investors’ enthusiasm. UBS (UBS-0.45%) analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a report late last month that the rise is “mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history).” The company’s stock has repeatedly been criticized for behaving like a meme stock, given Musk’s massive influence over Tesla influencers and retail investors. In the past, analysts have even noted that they have “painfully” discovered that memes shared on Reddit can affect the stock more than actual financial metrics. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bitcoin Crosses Above $101K as XRP, AI Tokens Lead Crypto Rally Following CPI

The crypto market is in recovery mode on Wednesday following a cascade of selling earlier in the week that for now appears to have flushed out much of the long leverage. The move higher comes alongside a sizable rally in the U.S. stock market following this morning's Consumer Price Index report that matched economist forecasts. The news was enough to convince traders that the Federal Reserve is certain to trim its benchmark fed funds rate another 25 basis points at its meeting next week. The Nasdaq is ahead 1.5% and the S&P 500 just shy of 1%.

Title: China's top smartphone player is still years behind the U.S.

Despite its comeback to compete with Apple in the Chinese smartphone market, Huawei’s latest smartphone shows it is still years behind, researchers found. In November, the Chinese tech giant launched its Mate 70 smartphone series, including the Mate 70 Pro Plus, which is powered by a Kirin 9020 processor. The chip, however, uses 7-nanometer processing technology — the same process node used in the Mate 60 that it released last August, according to a teardown by researchers at TechInsights. The 7-nanometer process node means Huawei is about 5 years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+3.80%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia (NVDA-2.72%) and Apple (AAPL-0.59%), which released its first 7-nanometer chip in 2018. In April, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Huawei’s Mate 60 signaled that U.S. export controls on advanced technology “are working because that chip is not nearly as good” and “years behind what we have in the United States.” “We were expecting to find the Kirin 9100 chipset in the Mate 70 line-up,” TechInsights said, adding that China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which manufactures chips for Huawei, was rumored to have used 5-nanometer processing technology for the chip. TSMC, which makes a majority of the world’s advanced chips, has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. Meanwhile, Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process, Bloomberg reported in November. The stalled efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML+0.69%). In October, TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip and found TSMC-made technology — a possible violation of U.S. trade restrictions. At the same time, SMIC is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: GM is killing Cruise robotaxis

Time Published: 2024-12-11T16:08:05Z

😮 The 50 greatest innovations of 2024: From Polaris Dawn to pig-to-human transplants 😮 By Mack DeGeurin Posted on Dec 11, 2024 General Motors is officially ending its support for Crusie’s beleaguered fleet of self-driving “robotaxis.” In a surprise announcement this week, the US carmaker said it will “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to end robotaxis and instead focus on eventually creating an autonomous personal vehicle. Cruise, which previously operated as a subsidiary, will now be fully absorbed by GM. That’s all a major departure for the driverless car company which had its sights set on offering paid robotaxis rides in multiple cities next year. Cruise previously proclaimed it planned to have close to a million of its autonomous vehicles flooding US streets by the end of the decade. In the end, safety concerns and a bungled 2023 California rollout may have left the company with wounds too deep to ever fully heal. GM revealed the news via press release Tuesday afternoon. The carmaker cited growing costs and increased competition as the primary drivers for the change. The company said it would have required “considerable time and resources” needed to properly scale the robotaxi business up to make it viable. Cruise vehicles were still being tested in multiple cities this week. Now, as part of GM, Cruise will work on improving GM’s “Super Cruise” driver assist features in its lineup of vehicles. GM says the decision to end its robotaxi business could save the company $1 billion per year. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “You have to understand the cost of running a robo taxi fleet, which is not our core business and is very expensive,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts first reported in The New York Times. Cruise, which maintained one of the largest robotaxi operations in the US, was primarily competing against Alphabet-owned Waymo, which already offers thousands of paid driverless rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles every day. Amazon-backed Zoox, currently testing in multiple cities, is also expected to launch its robo taxi operation in Las Vegas next year. Though Cruise’s robotaxi dreams are effectively dead, GM said it’s still holding out hope for a fully autonomous personal vehicle. The immediate focus, however, seems to be on more restrained (and less controversial) advanced driver assist systems (ADAS). “As the largest U.S. automotive manufacturer, we’re fully committed to autonomous driving and excited to bring GM customers its benefits–things like enhanced safety, improved traffic flow, increased accessibility, and reduced driver stress,” GM senior vice president of software and services engineering Dave Richardson said in the press release. The news reportedly came as a shock to Cruise engineers, several of whom told TechCrunch they heard about the news at the same time as the media. Others told the outlet they were “blindsided” by the change of focus and are expecting layoffs as a result. Employees speaking with TechCrunch suspect the cuts could impact non-engineering roles like government affairs and remote assistance teams that were operating in Houston, Phoenix, and other test cities. GM did not immediately respond to our request for comment but noted in its press release that it was working with Crusie to “restructure and refocus” the unit’s operations. A spokesperson from GM said it was “too early to provide specifics” regarding layoffs. The company expects the restructuring to be complete by mid 2025. [ Related: Why are ‘driverless’ cars still hitting things? ] The surprise decision comes after Cruise has spent the better part of a year trying to repair a damaged reputation. After years of research and development, Cruise was finally granted approval to begin operating its robotaxis in San Francisco in August 2023. But within days, reports surfaced of Crusie vehicles blocking traffic, running through stop signs, and swerving to avoid people on the road. That rough rollout inspired immediate push-back and criticism from activists, some of which attached traffic cones to the hoods of cars to fool Cruise sensors and immobilize them. All of the pressure reached a boiling point in October 2023, when a pedestrian was hit by a vehicle and flung underneath a nearby Cruise vehicle. The robotaxi dragged the pedestrian for 20 feet before finally pulling over. University of San Francisco Professor and autonomous vehicle expert William Riggs previously told Popular Science that tragic mistake was likely the result of Crusie failing to consider placing sensors capable of detecting humans underneath their vehicles. “There wasn’t a camera underneath the vehicle, the engineers couldn’t see somebody was there,” Riggs said. “It was truly something that no one had ever thought of.” The California DMV revoked Curise’s license to operate in the state following the dragging incident. That led to the swift resignation of then CEO Kyle Vogt. Not long after that, the company laid off 900 employees, or around 24% of its workforce. After months in the dark, Cruise attempted to begin to bounce back this year. The company reportedly received $850 million in support from GM over the summer to help relaunch testing operations in Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. Just three months ago Cruise announced a partnership with Uber that would have reportedly let ride hailers access its robotaxis through the Uber app in several cities next year. That’s no longer on the table. Ultimately, Cruise was never able to fully recover from its botched San Francisco rollout. Polling shows drivers are still concerned about driverless vehicle safety and the repeated missteps did little to alleviate those worries. Cruise also backtracked and ceded ground to Waymo, its primary competitor, at precisely the wrong time. Waymo is already offering thousands of paid trips every day and expanding operations to more cities next. In hindsight, it’s unclear whether or not Cruise would ever be able to close that distance and release a taxi that could meaningfully compete with Waymo and other deep-pocketed rivals.

Title: Google Might Start Layoffs In January Claims Post On Online Message Board

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Google employees are worried that they might be laid off next year as the firm has allegedly increased its target layoffs for the lowest performers, according to unverified posts on an employee board. According to posters, managers at one of the biggest technology companies in the world have tightened the criteria for letting go of employees even amidst productivity growth among Google engineers. Google, like its tech peer Microsoft, has struggled to match the stock market performance of the top performers in 2024 due to regulatory concerns revolving around its search engine business. The posts follow Google parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call, in which CFO Anat Ashkenazi shared that she would like to reengineer the firm's cost base further. Google parent Alphabet generates most of its revenue from its search engine and advertising businesses that hold a tight grip on the industry. Consequently, with the firm engaged in legal battles with the Justice Department, investors have been wary of investing in its shares. The stock's troubles have also been due to the early stage of AI investing being focused on hardware providers - or just NVIDIA. While Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates for revenue, earnings and sales from major business divisions, they also revealed $13.72 billion in traffic acquisition costs (TAC). These were higher than analyst estimates of $13.53 billion, with the figure coming at a time when advertising revenue grew by 10% annually and search revenue jumped by 12.3% year-over-year. The subsequent post-earnings call was also the first time Alphabet's new CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, got an opportunity to outline her strategy during earnings. Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet after spending more than two decades at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, revealed that she planned to "build on" previous efforts to streamline "operations across the company through the use of AI." Amidst this backdrop, a post on the online message board Team Blind claims that Google will start laying off employees in January. According to the poster, the firm has increased its "lower buckets" to 10% from an earlier 8%. These buckets are of low-performing employees who might be let go. The Google employee believes that since Google's output has increased to "an average of 500 code changes a year" finding these low performing employees is easier than before. They add that simply being a low performer might not be an adequate reason for an employee to be laid off. Instead, the poster believes that other factors such as being on the wrong project or on management's radar for low-performance can also lead to someone being let go. Their post made three days ago, was met with skepticism and additional facts by employees from Google and other firms. Another Google employee who claims to work in the firm's Cloud business claims that the target layoff percentage for Google Cloud is 6%. Employees of Amazon and Capital One claim that the percentage at their organizations ranges from 6% to 15%. Additionally, Google employees on a separate post were also worried about layoffs, but others also joked about non-verifiable information on the Internet. Worried questions from employees at an all-hands meeting in November followed the Alphabet CFO's comments at the earnings call. As reported by CNBC, Google's vice president of recruiting, Brian Ong, confirmed that the firm was "hiring less than we did a couple of years ago." Google's layoffs in 2023 generated widespread fury after reports of long time employees being let go without warning. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

We’ll walk you through installing and styling some plugins to show you how easy it is to boost your blog’s look and feel. Before we can revamp our blog, we first have to install the plugins. Start by logging into your WordPress admin dashboard. Locate the plugins tab and click Add New Plugin. Next, click the Upload Plugin button at the top left of your screen. Click the Choose File button and locate the first plugin, Divi Blog Extras, on your computer to upload. Once loaded, click Install Now. Once the plugin is installed, click the Activate Plugin button. Follow the steps above to install the remaining plugins: DiviSwift Ajax Search and Divi Table Of Contents Maker. Our last product, the Divi Blog Module Pack, requires a different setup that we’ll review in the next step. Note: For DiviSwift Ajax Search to function correctly, you must have WooCommerce installed. As mentioned, the Divi Blog Module Pack is installed slightly differently than a plugin. Within the main folder, you’ll find several folders and files. The folders contain all the layouts in the pack for carousel styles, module grid view styles, and module list view styles. To make things easier to decipher, the developer created a catch-all JSON file that allows you to install all layouts in the pack. To install the layouts, click on Divi > Divi Library in the WordPress dashboard. Next, click the Import & Export button at the top right of the Divi Library screen. Click the import tab and select Choose File. Navigate to the unzipped Divi Blog Module Pack file on your computer. We will only install some of the layouts in the pack. Instead, we’ll select the DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80 folder as illustrated below. Click to open the folder. Select the All_DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80.json file to import into the Divi Library. With the file loaded, choose if you want to import presets, then click Import Divi Builder Layouts. Once all layouts are loaded, they will appear in the Divi Library. While you can’t preview the layouts in the Divi Builder, you can view them on the developer’s website. There, you’ll find all grid view, list view, and carousel layouts conveniently numbered to correspond with the layout titles in the Divi Library. For our blog page, we’d like a hero section showcasing one post from our blog. To do this, create a new single-row section at the top of your blog page. Click to add the Divi Blog Extras module to the row. When the module settings open, choose the layout from the Blog Layout dropdown menu. We’ll select Box Extended. Under the query tab, choose the post type and post count. We’ll select 1 for this section. Be sure to choose the appropriate category as well. Under elements, choose the settings you’d like to use, including whether to show the featured image, read more links, author, date, and other meta information. The design tab allows you to style the title, body text, author, and meta info. If your site uses global colors and fonts, you won’t have to make any changes to make the module match your branding, as Divi Blog Extras will automatically load your preferences. Next, we’ll add a layout from the Divi Blog Module Pack to display our remaining blog posts. Add a new row beneath the hero section to add a pre-made layout from the pack. Next, click the Add From Library tab. When the dialog box appears, click on a layout from the pack. We’ll select style 26. Once the layout is loaded, you can modify it directly in the Visual Builder to suit your preferences. Two code modules are present: one for JavaScript and one for CSS. The CSS code module can be altered to match your branding, including button and background colors, animations, and more. Before exiting the Visual Builder, we must save the updated section to our Divi Library. This will assist us in making an archive template in the next step. To save the section, hover over it to reveal the settings. Click the ellipsis menu at the top right corner of the section. Next, click Save to Library. Give the layout a recognizable name, choose the appropriate options, and click Save to Library. After making your changes, you can save the page to view the new blog page. Now that we have our main blog page styled, the next step is to create an archive page for search results. We will incorporate the Divi Blog Extras plugin to do this. We’ll need to enable some settings to create our archive page, so let’s start by navigating to Settings & Divi Blog Extras. On the settings page, click the Custom Post Types tab. Here, you can enable custom post types and custom taxonomies in modules. This allows you to add custom post types to the Divi Blog Module to showcase content other than blog posts. This can be useful for all kinds of websites, including real estate sites, portfolios, and ecommerce sites. You can enable various layouts for categories, tags, author pages, dates, and taxonomies in the Archives tab. Click to allow the toggle on each tab or the tabs where you’d like to use a custom layout. For example, when you enable the category archive layout, you’ll be prompted to select a Divi Library layout with at least one Divi Blog Extras module. Since we created a blog page with a Divi Blog Extras module, we’ll use that one for our archive template. Choose whether to use a sidebar or a full-width layout and click Save Changes to continue. Once enabled, Divi Blog Extras will revamp your category page with a more streamlined look. Another way to boost your blog is to add a table of contents to your blog posts. A table of contents makes long-form content easy to navigate, which helps your visitors find what they want. The easiest way to accomplish this is to add a TOC to your blog post Theme Builder template. Start by navigating to Divi > Theme Builder. Here, you’ll find all of the templates associated with your website. Most existing Divi websites will already have a blog post template, so all you’ll need to do is edit it. If not, you can easily create one using a combination of Divi Modules. For this post, we assume you either already know how to make a template or already have one. Once in the Theme Builder, locate the template associated with your blog posts. Click the custom body section to edit it. Click to add a new row below the featured image. Locate the Table Of Contents Maker module and click to add it to the template. Next, you’ll configure the content settings. You can show or hide the header, include all headings or pick specific heading levels, add keyword text highlights, adjust scroll speed, and more. In the design tab, you can style the module’s header, title text, icons, keyword highlights (if enabled), and more. Once you have the settings in place, save the template and preview one of your posts to see how it looks! The last step is configuring the search options for the DiviSwift Ajax Search extension. By default, DiviSwift Ajax Search integrates with the standard Divi Search Module and the search functionality within your site’s main header. Whether you use the standard header or create a global header template, the extension’s functionality is already built in. The only thing you need to do is style it to match your existing site. To configure its settings, navigate to Divi > Ajax Search in the WordPress dashboard. Once clicked, the Divi Theme Customizer will launch to reveal the extension’s settings. Here, you can customize the search text, choose the contents to display, and customize the other results text. You can also configure options for out-of-stock products, exclude specific pages from search results, or hide product variations. DiviSwift also allows you to customize the search module’s border, background, buttons, and highlights. Once you make the desired changes, publish them. Then, you can test the functionality and make additional changes as needed. You can make big changes to enhance your blog by purchasing the Cyber Monday Blog Bundle.

Title: What can't weight-loss meds do? Eli Lilly to start testing Zepbound for drug and alcohol addiction
URL: https://qz.com/eli-lilly-zepbound-drug-alcohol-addiction-trial-1851718464
Time Published: 2024-12-11T15:57:00Z
Full Content:
Eli Lilly (LLY+0.35%), the pharma giant that produces the popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, said it plans to test obesity medications as a treatment for alcohol and drug addiction starting next year. The news comes as the body of evidence suggesting that Zepbound and other GLP-1 weight-loss medications could help people with substance use disorders continues to grow. “These medicines, we think and we’ve aimed to prove, can be useful for other things we don’t think about connected to weight. These are often called anti-hedonics, so they are reducing that desire cycle,” said Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks Tuesday at The Economic Club of Washington D.C., STAT News reported. “Next year, you’ll see Lilly start large studies in alcohol abuse and nicotine use, even in drug abuse.” Zepbound belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, which was made popular by Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment. These drugs mimic hormones that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.72%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know “Lilly continues to evaluate future development options for its medicines but has not announced development plans for the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications at this point in time,” a Lilly spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. There have already been several retrospective studies that have found associations between GLP-1 treatments and lower risks of alcohol and opioid abuse. Authors of one study explained that the mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” they wrote. While these retrospective analyses show promise, Eli Lilly will be the first pharmaceutical company to conduct clinical trials specifically focused on addiction treatment. The company’s planned studies of obesity medications for alcohol and drug addiction, set to begin next year, mark a significant shift from the current research landscape. Meanwhile, competitor Novo Nordisk has taken an initial step by incorporating alcohol consumption measurements into its ongoing trial of GLP-1 drugs for alcohol-related liver disease. These trials follow other anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggests GLP-1 drugs can help users curb addictions. A Morgan Stanley (MS-0.32%) survey from earlier this year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. The investment bank surveyed approximately 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1. The analysts noted they were “cautious about drawing conclusions” from their survey about the impact of GLP-1 drugs on addictive behaviors. While research hasn’t yet proven a causal link, clinical trials are currently underway to better understand the effects of GLP-1s on alcohol and tobacco consumption. One small trial found that people with alcohol use disorder drank less after taking semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic — compared with people who took a placebo.

Title: Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $1.13 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), renowned for its iconic iPhone, Mac computers, and iPads, also derives significant revenue from its services segment, which includes Apple Pay, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. On October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a record fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, fueled by strong demand for the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The company is also gearing up for the release of its 18.2 software update, which will introduce a range of AI-powered features and is expected to roll out to users soon. Additionally, the tech giant is expanding its services into new markets, with the highly anticipated launch of Apple Intelligence in China marking a significant step in its global growth strategy. UBS analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic stance on Apple’s iPhone 16, citing mixed demand signals and lukewarm interest in AI-related features, particularly outside of China. A UBS Evidence Lab survey revealed varying consumer sentiment across regions. In the U.S., purchase intent remained steady at 24%, while in China, it dipped to 17%, a 200-basis-point decline from 2023. However, Europe showed positive trends, with purchase intent rising in the U.K. by 200 basis points to 19% and in Germany by 300 basis points to 14%. Despite the tempered demand and skepticism toward AI features, UBS raised its global smartphone sell-in estimates to 1.21 billion units for 2024 and 1.24 billion units for 2025, indicating modest growth. On December 2, UBS maintained a $236 price target and a Neutral rating for AAPL shares, valuing the stock at 32 times its projected 2026 earnings per share of $7.49. In its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.” Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Plastics Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. To compile our list of the 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now, we looked for the largest plastics companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best plastics stocks. From an initial pool of more than 20 plastics stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). YAKOBCHUK VIACHESLAV/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. The company is making significant strides in the field of advanced recycling, which positions it as a promising investment opportunity for those interested in plastics. On November 21, 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced a substantial investment of over $200 million to enhance its advanced recycling operations at its facilities in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas. This expansion will enhance the company’s ability to recycle hard-to-process plastics and divert them from landfills. The advanced recycling process transforms plastic waste into raw materials for various products, including fuels and high-performance plastics and chemicals. This method can handle types of plastic that traditional recycling cannot, helping to reduce waste and support a circular economy for plastics. With this investment, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will boost its annual recycling capacity to 500 million pounds, moving closer to its goal of reaching 1 billion pounds per year by 2027. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is also developing additional recycling projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company has advanced recycling customers in over 15 countries across various sectors, such as food-safe packaging and pet food, where demand is growing. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also advancing its technology-driven businesses, particularly with its innovative Proxxima thermoset resin. This new material is not only stronger and lighter than traditional options, but it also boasts superior corrosion resistance. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) estimates that the total addressable market for Proxxima could reach 5 million tons per year and a potential market value of $30 billion by 2030. Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (NYSE:XOM) strong market presence, combined with its strategic investments in advanced materials, positions it as a strong stock to consider for investors looking for growth in the plastics and materials sector. Overall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best plastics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Supreme Court allows investors' class action to proceed against microchip company Nvidia
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/supreme-court-allows-investors-class-action-proceed-microchip-116680773
Time Published: 2024-12-11T15:44:13Z

The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court's decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia's bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. “This is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency," Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement. In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming.

The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court's decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia's bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. “This is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency," Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement. In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia's recent performance has been spectacular.

Title: What’s Happening With Amazon Stock?

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: An attendee passes an AWS logo at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference ... [+] hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has fared well this year, rising by close to 50% so far. This is well ahead of fellow big tech titans Apple and Alphabet which remain up by about 34% each. Amazon has clearly gotten a lot of things right. Amazon’s massive recommence infrastructure investments made over the last several years are showing clear signs of paying off, as operating profits surge. The company has also executed well on its advertising business. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Costco Stock? Amazon is also seen as a big winner in the generative AI space, driven by its cloud business. Also, Google has announced a potential tech breakthrough. See What’s Happening With Google Stock? So what are some of the recent developments for Amazon stock? Amazon is doubling down on designing its proprietary AI chips. Last week, the company unveiled Trainium3, its most powerful in-house AI chip, which it says is 2x as fast as its predecessor, Trainium2, while delivering roughly 40% better energy efficiency. The chips are expected to be available in 2025 and will reportedly be fabricated using TSMC’s latest 3nm technology. Whether development goes smoothly or runs into delays, could add volatility to the stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon is marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as search. The consumer tech giant has also indicated that it was evaluating if the latest Amazon chip can be used to train AI models included in Apple Intelligence. Separately, Amazon announced plans for a massive AI supercomputer built using hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. While Amazon is expected to remain a significant customer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs, its in-house chip development could eventually help it lower costs for its AWS business and potentially build new revenue streams. See why it may be time to sell Nvidia stock and buy Intel Amazon is expanding into the automotive space with its new venture Amazon Autos, which will enable customers to purchase vehicles in 48 U.S. cities. The platform will initially focus on selling new cars, with South Korea’s Hyundai starting off as its launch partner. Amazon has indicated that it intends to gradually expand by adding more brands, as well as cities in the coming years. Amazon will act as a go-between, connecting customers to local dealerships that will remain the final sellers of the vehicles. Although Amazon has little experience in the auto industry, its vast and highly engaged customer base as well as the widespread dissatisfaction with traditional car dealership experiences should give it a meaningful opportunity. Now looking over a slightly longer period, the returns for Amazon stock have been more volatile than the S&P 500 at 2% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 81% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon stock is increasingly seen as a reasonable value. While the company has historically traded at negative or triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios, its valuation metrics are improving. The company’s stock currently trades at about 35x 2025 consensus earnings. Although revenue growth may slow, Amazon’s margins are clearly on an upward trajectory. Amazon has implemented effective cost management strategies, adopting a more measured hiring pace and enhancing operational efficiency. Over the last quarter, Amazon’s cloud division, reported an operating income of $10.4 billion, a remarkable 50% increase year-over-year, significantly outpacing revenue growth of 19%. Amazon has also been tweaking its capex strategy, reducing spending on lower-return e-commerce infrastructure, while doubling down on technology infrastructure to meet rising artificial intelligence demand. At its current market price of $225, the stock is trading roughly in line with the Trefis price estimate of $230 per share - the Trefis estimate for Amazon’s valuation.

Title: My ‘Trump 2.0’ Dividend Stock Forecast For 2025

PARIS, FRANCE - DECEMBER 07: President-elect Donald Trump leaves after their meeting at the Elysee ... [+] Palace in Paris, France on December 07, 2024. (Photo by Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu via Getty Images) We’re now well on our way to Trump 2.0, and I’m getting a lot of questions from readers about where things head from here. I see the new administration as overall bullish for stocks. But the truth is, fortunes will be made in the next four years and, sadly, retirements will be lost. My job is to keep you on the right side of the financial markets. One thing I can say is that the next four years will be challenging for two kinds of investors: Those strategies won’t cut it in the next four years, which will be a stock picker’s market. Moving into, and out of, particular stocks in a timely way will be key. Just look at what investors who got caught sitting in General Motors (GM)—which is as tariff-exposed as they come—have dealt with since the president-elect announced potential new tariffs on Canada and Mexico on November 25. GM Stock Price In our November 26 article, we discussed other stocks to sell (or avoid) during Trump 2.0, too. Like Mattel (MAT) and Hasbro (HAS), both of which still make a lot of their toys and games in China, leaving them vulnerable to tariffs. But there are plenty of winners-in-the-making, too. Which brings me to defense stocks—one defense stock in particular. When it comes to defense stocks, one question leaps out about Trump 2.0: If Trump does cut a deal with Russia to end its war on Ukraine—or with China to calm tensions in the Pacific—is the associated “peace dividend” bearish for defense stocks? At large, perhaps, but if it does, its main impact will be on defense firms that haven’t diversified away from what I’ll call physical weapons. Consider, for example, Lockheed Martin (LMT), which leans on systems like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missiles, helicopters, such as the Blackhawk, and space systems, for the bulk of its revenue. Those products will stay in high demand as countries around the world keep boosting defense spending. And they’re likely to escape import tariffs if trade tensions do ramp up in the months ahead. However, while Lockheed does have strong prospects, defense spending does tend to ebb and flow in the long run, with the rhythm of world events. But there is one thing that will continue to be a threat no matter what’s happening geopolitically: cyberattacks. Cybersecurity and information technology (IT) upgrades are the sales straw that stirs the drink at General Dynamics (GD). In the third quarter, the company pulled 29% of its earnings from its technology division. That business’s gross margins jumped to 9.7% in the latest quarter from 9.5% a year ago. That helped it chip in the highest operating earnings of any of the company’s other divisions (which include aerospace, marine systems and combat systems), at $326 million. In February, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) was awarded a $922-million contract to upgrade the US Central Command’s (CENTCOM) IT infrastructure. This follows a big year, 2023, that included $2-billion GDIT contract wins. To be sure, the company’s physical weapons—like the Abrams tank, Stryker combat vehicle and nuclear subs—are why GD finds itself in the same bucket as firms like Lockheed, Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), not cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). But at my Hidden Yields service, we mainly hold the stock because of its overlooked value as a cybersecurity play. We also like it because it’s a backdoor play on AI automation at the federal level. AI plays a central role in GDIT’s strategy—it has deployed a Luna AI system that uses machine learning to draw insights from large reams of data. Luna is designed specifically for government and defense applications. GD flatlined during Trump 1.0, but we have higher expectations this time around given the AI angle. What’s more, GD’s “Dividend Magnet”—or the tendency for a stock to track its dividend higher over time—is also telling us that the stock is undervalued: As you can see below, the shares have fallen a bit behind, setting us up for future “snap back” upside: GD Dividend Magnet The drop you see on the right side above is due to an overdone reaction to the company’s Q3 earnings, which did come up short of expectations, even though EPS jumped 10.2% year over year. That’s our opportunity. As is another source of hidden value: GD’s outsized order backlog, with a total estimated contract value of $137.6 billion as of the end of Q3.

Neil Doak previously served as an assistant coach with Georgia. Former Ulster coach Neil Doak has been appointed as head coach of the Ireland U-20s for the 2025 Six Nations. The experienced former scrum-half was part of the ticket under Willie Faloon for this year’s World Cup in South Africa and now steps up to the top job. Doak will be assisted by former Connacht and Munster out-half Ian Keatley, ex-Connacht second row Andrew Browne and Blackrock College scrum guru Seamus Toomey who has been linked with a set-piece role with the IRFU. Ireland open their campaign against England in Cork and will warm up with a game against Italy on Friday week in St Mary’s RFC and against a Leinster Development XV on January 4. “It is a huge honour to take on the role of Ireland Men’s U-20s head coach, and a challenge I am massively excited about,” he said. "We have had a number of camps in the High Performance Centre and the application, hard work and commitment of the players has been really impressive. “We have a lot of work to get through in preparation for the U20 Six Nations, but the group are focused on building positively day-by-day and the upcoming matches against Italy and the Leinster Development XV over the Christmas and New Year period present us with an invaluable opportunity to build that cohesion and momentum. “We look forward to the challenges ahead, starting off with the visit of England to Virgin Media Park, where the Ireland U20s have received incredible support from the people of Cork in recent years, and we are determined to continue our excellent home record there and produce a performance we can be proud of.” Doak played cricket for Ireland at the same time as enjoying a career as a scrum-half for Ulster, before becoming a noted attack coach with his home province where he served as interim head coach while Les Kiss was still with Ireland, while he worked for Worcester Warriors between 2018 and 2020. He was part of Kiss’s coaching ticket for Ireland’s 2013 summer tour of the United States and Canada and has also worked at international level with Emerging Ireland in 2014 and Georgia in 2020 when he worked alongside IRFU performance director David Humphreys. In recent years, he’s been working in Ulster’s academy.

Microsoft shareholders have rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin [BTC], despite predictions of significant market growth. The proposal was led by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted BTC’s position as the seventh-largest global asset, with its market capitalization expected to surpass $2 trillion shortly and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. However, concerns over volatility led to the board’s decision, supported by major institutional investors like Vanguard and BlackRock. Instead, Microsoft is focusing on AI innovation and is cautious about cryptocurrency investments, underscoring a strategic shift away from digital assets in favor of cutting-edge technological advancements. Remarking on the same, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO said in a proxy statement, “AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, and we believe it will fundamentally bend the productivity curve for every individual, organization, and industry sector to help us address some of our most pressing global challenges.” Nadella added, “We know Microsoft will only succeed if the world is fundamentally succeeding. We are focused on ensuring the world benefits from the broad technological shift to AI, while mitigating its risks.” The proposal, suggested by the National Center for Public Policy Research, recommended allocating 1% of Microsoft’s assets, approximately $784 million, to BTC as a hedge against inflation. Despite the proposal’s innovative approach, concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and potential risks to financial stability led to the board’s decision. Institutional investors like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, who collectively own about 70% of Microsoft shares, supported the board’s position, balancing a cautious view with their broader crypto interests. This highlights that Microsoft’s focus remains on stability, with a preference for predictability over risk. BTC’s volatility, substantial market fluctuations, and the risk of significant losses—such as its 70% decline in 2022—may have influenced Microsoft’s decision to reject the proposal. Additionally, the strategic use of cash flows to support operations and future investments is critical, and liquidating Bitcoin during market downturns could lead to losses. Furthermore, ongoing regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies adds an extra layer of complexity. As a result, Microsoft remains focused on low-risk assets like treasury bonds to maintain long-term stability and sustainable growth. As expected, Microsoft’s decision to reject BTC investment faced significant criticism and sarcasm from the crypto community, as highlighted by Bitcoin Archive in its recent X post. Source: Bitcoin Archive/X Saylor too jumped in and said, “In 5 years, they’ll understand. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve.#BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” Despite this, several supporters came to Microsoft’s defense, emphasizing the company’s focus on long-term stability and strategic caution.

Title: GM Kills Cruise Robotaxis to Save $1B Annually

Time Published: 2024-12-11T12:53:24Z

General Motors has announced it will no longer fund its Cruise Robotaxi program, effectively shutting it down. The automaker will fold Cruise employees into existing teams and prioritize its driver assistance system, Super Cruise, instead of robotaxis. “Consistent with GM’s capital allocation priorities, GM will no longer fund robotaxi development work given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market,” reads the press release. High costs and accidents have plagued Cruise, while its biggest rival Waymo has continued to see success. GM, which currently owns 90% of Cruise, will increase its ownership to 97% and eventually acquire the remaining shares. Cruise's shutdown will also save GM $1 billion a year, according to the company. Cruise staff told TechCrunch they were "surprised” and “blindsided” by the decision, learning about the transition at the same time as the media. Sunsetting Cruise could take several months, and GM has not yet said if any layoffs will occur as a result. Cruise has had a tough time since October last year, when one of its robotaxis ran over a woman in San Francisco. Following the incident, the California DMV suspended Cruise’s license, forcing the company to halt operations nationwide until it had regained public trust. Further, the company recorded a loss of $3.48 billion in 2023 and was fined $500,000 last month for providing false records on the San Francisco crash. It's unlikely Cruise's deal with Uber, which was announced back in August, will still move forward now that Cruise is shutting down. PCMag has reached out to Uber for comment on the status of this program. As Cruise disappears, other AV firms are expected to press on with their robotaxi plans. Tesla has announced its robotaxis, which may hit the road in 2025, and Google-owned Waymo has continued to expand its service. And Amazon-backed Zoox got approval last month to drive its robotaxis (which don't have steering wheels) on the streets of San Francisco. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Why Is Tesla (TSLA) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the autonomous driving industry and one of the hottest firms in the sector. Its FSD assisted driving platform is among the industry leaders in America, and FSD’s success is also baked into the firm’s hypothesis. Through FSD and its Cybercabs, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to unlock new markets and diversify away from being an EV manufacturer. Consequently, the firm has to deliver on these fronts or see trouble with the share price as was evident in October after the stock fell by 9% after Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Cybercab event failed to impress investors with the specifics. However, the stock is up by a whopping 52% since the November election due to CEO Elon Musk’s proximity with President-elect Donald Trump and the market’s belief that this can generate positive catalysts for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The firm also benefits from having 1.3 billion miles of data to train autonomous systems and computing resources to crunch its algorithms. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period.” Overall, TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why The Kroger-Albertsons Merger Was Blocked

Atlanta, Georgia, Kroger. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) A Federal Judge and a King County Judge in Washington state have blocked the $25 billion merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. The decision is a victory for consumers, grocery workers, smaller-scale suppliers and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC successfully argued that the merger would raise prices by eliminating competition and weaken union bargaining power. Kroger and Albertsons countered that they needed to merge to compete with Walmart, Costco and Amazon, and that selling off 579 stores would preserve competition after the merger. The resulting grocery behemoth would have over 5,000 stores. The two companies spent close to $1 billion to push the merger through, money that maybe could have instead gone towards lowering grocery prices. The Institute for Local Self Reliance, which opposed the merger, stated, “This historic ruling marks the first time that the government has blocked a supermarket merger in decades. It shows that the administration's push to reinvigorate our antitrust laws is succeeding, including, crucially, in the courts.” A group of UFCW local unions (UFCW 7, 324, 400, 770, 1564 and 3000) leading the Stop the Merger coalition, also put out a statement, “The well-reasoned decisions today by both Courts make plain what union grocery workers have known all along – this mega-merger would be bad for workers who deserve a workplace where they can be paid well for their labor, be safe and be respected. It would be disastrous for shoppers who deserve competition that leads to better choices and lower prices. The merger would be detrimental to our communities, would harm farmers and suppliers who deserve a healthy balance to negotiate fair prices for their hard work.” The top 6 chains control 65% of grocery retail sales nationally, the top 4 over 50%. Walmart alone controls nearly 30% nationally and over 50% in many regions. Kroger and Albertsons own dozens of regional banners that millions of people shop in daily. Kroger owns Fred Meyer, QFC, Harris Teeter, Vitacost, Smith’s, Ralph’s and King Soopers, and others, while Albertsons owns Jewel-Osco, Safeway, Vons, Pavilion, Acme, King’s, Shaw’s, Tom Thumb and Randalls and others.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Kroger or Albertsons are the No.1, 2 or 3 market share leader in almost every metro area they operate in, such as: This retail consolidation among a handful of chains enables concentration further back in the supply chain, especially in CPG, or consumer packaged goods. The top 4 yogurt companies, including Danone, Lactalis and Chobani, control 75% of sales and the top 3 cereal companies, including General Mills, Post and Kellogg’s, control 90% of your crunchy breakfast options. Four or fewer corporations also control 93% of soda sales, including Coke and Pepsi, 80% of candy, such as Hershey, Mondelez and Mars, 60% of snack bars, including Mars, Kellanova and General Mills, 66% of frozen pizza, 60% of bread, 80% of toothpaste and 80% of toilet paper sales. Such retail and CPG concentration supercharged the price inflation that in turn created windfall profits from 2020-2022. Inflation was not demand-driven, as some economists have suggested. Overall grocery prices are up over 30%, while unit volumes are actually flat or down since 2019: The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine created ample consumer concerns to give cover fire for companies up and down the supply chain to pass prices to consumers above the rate of their own cost inflation. These practices, called “sellers inflation” by economist Isabella Weber, may have contributed to over 50% of all food price inflation from 2020-2022. In that timeframe, Walmart raised prices on thousands of items well above the rate of inflation, including potato chips by 35%, cookies by 62% and yogurt by 92%. Prices at Albertsons on store brand oils increased by 117%, potato chips by 68% and packaged cheese by 125%. MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA - JULY 27: Customers leave a Safeway. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images) Kroger, Albertsons, Target and Dollar General all saw double-digit net income growth from 2020-2021. In 2020, Walmart and Kroger saw windfall profits as the economy shut down, adding $45 billion to the Walton family wealth and 2 billion dollar rounds of Kroger stock buybacks. During the Kroger-Albertsons merger trials, lots of information was revealed to add fuel to these concerns, as documented by Laurel Kilgour of the American Economic Liberties Project: Lina Khan meme. Blocking such an enormous merger is a brief victory for antitrust and labor advocates. It is a small step considering the challenges for the grocery industry beyond market concentration and higher prices, such as bird flu, climate change, the huge cost externalities from unhealthy food, as well as poverty wages and retail food deserts. Instead, the future could be a grocery industry with diversified ownership and governance, that prioritizes worker welfare and their standards of living, and that reflects a true cost accounting, transitioning towards diversified, regenerative and organic production. Such a sustainable and economic populism should not just be wishful thinking. Like blocking such massive grocery mergers, it should be common sense. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Commercial Real Estate in 2024 Was All About a Tough Turnaround

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy On April 8, 2024, millions of Americans briefly left their homes, schools and workplaces to view the Great North American Eclipse, the first total solar eclipse visible from this part of the globe in nearly seven years. Like any solar eclipse, the moon shifted directly between the sun and the Earth, thereby briefly (and totally) obscuring any view of our one star from Texas to Maine. In some ways, this cosmic event became both a harbinger and a fitting metaphor for national commercial real estate in 2024. The industry finally seemed ready to eclipse the nightmarish era of high interest rates that began in 2022, and much of the bad juju about office space seemed to dissipate as employers began issuing return-to-work mandates and signing up for big leases. At the same time, the real estate world remained stuck between the promise of increased transactions and true value discovery on one hand, and the peril of renewed inflation amid the uncertainties of a second Trump administration on the other. “For most people, it’s been a very unpredictable year,” said Laura Rapaport, founder and CEO of North Bridge, a firm specializing in environmentally driven C-PACE financing. “The rise in interest rates, the lack of activity, banks pulling back, changing valuations, and uncertainty surrounding the election has created a perfect storm of a stalemate and a race to scramble to find [capital] solutions.” For much of 2024, capital stacks remained out of balance due to persistently high interest rates, which left capital markets impaired and both borrowers and lenders in need of time, money, and maybe a little bit of luck to sort out unfavorable macroeconomic factors. The 10-year Treasury note, the industry benchmark for long-term financing, opened the year at 3.9 percent, rose as high as 4.7 percent in late April, fell to as low as 3.6 percent in mid-September, and proceeded to tick back to 4.4 percent following the election in November. This relative flatlining of the long-term rate over 11 months created similar conditions in the transaction marketplace. The number of CRE investment sales declined 4.7 percent year-over-year nationwide in the first three quarters of 2024 and was 33 percent lower than the average from 2017 to 2019. Those metrics barely improved from the investment sales data from the first quarter of 2024, when sales were also down 33 percent relative to the 2017-to-2019 average, according to Newmark capital markets data. “It was a fine year, it wasn’t an awful year, but in a year marked by lots of volatility and a lot of things going on in the world, there was surprising amount of consistency in the real estate world,” said Michael Gigliotti, senior managing director and New York Office co-head at JLL. “It never got really bad and it never got really good.” As for the short-term interest rate, or federal funds rate, CRE players watched in horror as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dithered for much of the year on his intention to finally make cuts — as he indicated in his December 2023 remarks. Instead, the central bank left the overnight lending rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent (its highest level in 17 years) for nine months, before mercifully initiating cuts of 75 basis points in September and November. “This was definitely the year we went through five stages of grief, from denial to acceptance,” said Scott Rechler, chairman and CEO of RXR. “During the year, owners and banks began to capitulate to where values are and acknowledge that, even if rates come down in the short term, longer-term, rates aren’t returning to where they were in this abnormal last decade of extremely low or zero percent rates. “There’s been more of a facing of that reality,” he added. Upside-down banking Reality hit the CRE industry square in the solar plexus early on in 2024. The stock of New York Community Bank (NYCB) — a Queens-based lender with 420 branches and assets exceeding $100 billion — declined 83 percent in February to less than $2 per-share on the heels of an announcement that the bank reported a $252 million loss tied to loans on its office and rent-regulated multifamily properties. Fourth-quarter credit losses in 2023 had reached a staggering $552 million. After replacing its CEO twice in one week, the bleeding stopped after NYCB received a $1 billion capital infusion from investors tied to former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Even so, the near collapse of a top regional bank elicited fears of a 2023 regional banking crisis redux, when Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank all fell within six weeks and cast a critical eye on the health of the CRE assets within the entire banking system. “In 2024, we saw a lot of banks be hesitant to negotiate with borrowers, they held firm, and what we’re seeing now is a lot of losses of larger banks. They’ll be taking massive losses,” said Chad Carpenter, founder and CEO of Reven Capital, a CRE investment firm, referring to Wells Fargo’s October 2024 announcement that it will lose up to $3 billion on its office loan portfolio. “Once those big losses are published, people will say, ‘If they have those big losses on those office buildings, then how many more losses do they have on their commercial real estate?’ ” Carpenter emphasized that impaired CRE assets like office loans are a major proportion of regional bank balance sheets, and he believes 70 percent of all leveraged, non-trophy buildings will get restructured and foreclosed on. That will put many regional banks at further risk. “Who has the bulk of the loan exposure? It’s the regional banks. The banking system owns 51 percent of all commercial real estate debt,” said Carpenter, who added the other 49 percent is owned by commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, life insurance companies, debt funds and mortgage real estate investment trusts. “Of the 51 percent, regional banks own 70 percent of it, and the regional banks have been slower to acknowledge impairments. So people need to take a hard look at some of these regional banks who have office loan exposure.” Rechler noted that in 2024 regionals such as Dime Community Bank and Valley National Bank saw their stock prices rise after raising equity. But their stocks still trade at a deep discount compared to their historical highs, opening the doors for private credit to continue its steady march forward as both a rescue option and an alternative when it comes to balance sheet banking. “The reality is, as these tremors play through, you’ll have a more permanent place for the non-bank lender,” explained Rechler, who raised $1 billion in 2024 for credit and equity investment purposes. “We’re having conversations with banks on a daily basis about being a financing partner so they can serve their clients, or buying loans from them, where they are the originator and we’re the balance sheet that holds their loans. “There’s opportunity in these situations where new structures and financial products will be created that will live on in this period and become part of the norm as we move forward,” he added. In 2024, alternative lenders firmly entrenched themselves as a permanent fixture in the CRE financial system — with banks heeding the stiff regulatory agenda of the international Basel III framework — as CRE sponsors were more than willing to stomach their onerous terms amid a veritable liquidity desert. In the first three quarters of the year, bank originations fell 24 percent year-over-year compared to 2023, a decline that was offset by increased lending from securitization, debt funds and insurance companies, according to data from Newmark. Warren de Haan, founder and CEO Of Acore Capital, a CRE alternative lender with a $21 billion portfolio, said that in 2024 his firm focused on two origination vehicles: senior loans, with Acore routinely filling 65 percent to 75 percent loan-to-value on credit structure; and opportunistic credit, in which the firm specialized in providing senior debt and bridge capital solutions to get borrowers to the other side of underwater financings. “Our universe of 500 borrowers mostly have capital structure problems, not fundamental problems, and we’re providing capital solutions to them from dollar zero to dollar 85 as a trusted, go-to lender,” said de Haan. “We’ve seen strong activity in our high-yield, opportunistic credit business, and our core business has rebounded significantly in the last three months [of the year].” De Haan added that the optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Fed lasted about eight weeks at the start of the year before a realization set in that sellers wouldn’t sell and transactions would be hung up. He said the market “went into the doldrums” until August rolled around, at which time the spectre of falling interest rates revived the animal spirits for private credit. “Come around to the end of summer, we have seen an increase in our pipeline that is consistent with our peak production years,” said de Haan, who tracked $2 billion in deals closing in November alone. “That’s harking back to our peak days, as opposed to what we’ve been seeing through 2023 and the first half of 2024, and it feels good. It feels like business is back.” Other non-bank lenders, including Josh Zegen’s Madison Realty Capital, found themselves busy as construction lenders, bridge lenders, note purchasers, and as lender servicers or financers, providing banks, private credit funds and mortgage REITs with needed capital. Zegen told Commercial Observer that his firm, which carries $21 billion in assets, financed a $400 million deal to build a 50-unit condo on Fisher Island in Miami Beach; a $133 million mortgage to finish construction of a 51-story, 379-key Marriott hotel in New York City; and secured $2.04 billion in equity commitments for its sixth U.S. real estate debt fund. “You’re starting to see the market finally start to break a bit on deals that might have been nonperforming [in the past],” said Zegen. “With this theme of higher-for-longer [interest rates], people feel they have to do something.” The rate cut that wasn’t — until it was It’s impossible to examine commercial real estate without understanding the impact of interest rates. For much of 2024, interest rates — and the lack of the long-promised cut to the federal funds rate — dominated the discussion in CRE. Some players characterized Fed Chair Powell’s delay throughout the year as a deliberate attempt to mask the false impressions needed to fight inflation with one hand while simultaneously reassuring a nervous capital markets system with the other. “While rates didn’t necessarily come down, the Fed used their rhetoric to keep financial markets loose, the stock market open, the bond market going, and spreads tight, so that it effectively induced the equivalent of reducing rates without having to cut them,” said Rechler. “It gave banks a chance to build appropriate reserves, and capital formation a chance to position itself.” Powell’s rhetoric fooled everyone. De Haan recalled meetings and conferences with leading executives at the start of the year opening with speculation about not if rates would be cut in 2024, but how often. “There was a moment in time, early in the year, where there was a lot of optimism, where we all believed rates would be cut,” de Haan recalled. “I remembered listening to very powerful people in prime banking seats talk about whether it would be three cuts or five cuts.” Instead, investors waited a full nine months for the federal funds rate to fall for the first time in two and a half years. The waiting game created a dichotomy for CRE: a slow first half turned on its head once rates dropped in September. “It seems like it’s been a tale of two halves, where the first half of the year was largely a similar environment to 2023, but then the third quarter and fourth quarter has probably seen elements of 2021, where activity levels have been extremely high,” said James Millon, president of U.S. debt and structured finance at CBRE (CBRE). JLL’s Gigliotti echoed these sentiments, calling the back half of the year among the most active markets in recent memory. “That month or so leading up to when we knew we’d get that rate cut — so August into that rate cut in September, and then a few weeks after that — was as active as any market that I can remember,” he said. Nowhere did the improved activity levels find their way to fruition more than in the beleaguered office sector, which saw its year-to-date sales metrics rise 17 percent compared to 2023, and investor allocation rise from 12 percent in 2023 to 15 percent in 2024, per Newmark. Back at the office “I think 2024 was the year for office in a couple of ways,” said Rechler. “People came back to the office, so that was a clear deciding factor, and the companies that came back realized they didn’t have enough space. So you saw a level of leasing activity, which going into the year we forecasted it would be 2018 levels, and it may even be higher than that.” Manhattan office leasing exceeded 30 million square feet in November, hitting that threshold for the first time since 2019, according to Colliers. Manhattan, the epicenter for American office, saw its office leasing activity grow by 5.6 percent during the third quarter of 2024 to 8.6 million square feet, its strongest quarterly volume in two years, per Colliers. “I’ve always said office will be like malls. Once you get through the period where it’s toxic to investors, there will be a delineation between Class A office that attracts tenants and does well — and will be priced that way — versus the other buildings,” explained Rechler, who added that RXR will have bought positions in more than 7 million square-feet of office in 2024. Carpenter, an office investment specialist, called 2024 a bifurcation between “the haves and the have-nots,” where the best office buildings in the best locations have seen “tremendous demand” and everyone else is “in trouble fighting for tenants.” “We’ll see buildings being demolished, we’ll see bankruptcies, we will see loan extensions, and probably the most interesting thing I’ve seen is the loan maturities,” he added. Gigliotti said every product type that his team represents has more bidders than it had a year ago, including office, which today has double the bidders. “In 2023, we had 43 groups bid on office, and, in the last three months [of this year] alone, we’ve had 83 groups, so there’s double the amount of lenders willing to bid on an office deal compared to a year ago,” he said. Mary Anne Tighe, CEO of the New York tri-state region at CBRE, said two factors drove the renewed acceleration of capital back into the office sector. First, there was the internal growth and need of private equity firms, hedge funds and law firms to distinguish themselves by leasing high-quality space. That has caused a run-up in pricing and an accompanying absorption of Class A properties. Moreover, Tighe added that four years after the pandemic, most businesses in the private sector realized the benefits of remote work aren’t all they were cracked up to be. “In the pandemic, the glow of remote work, and the glow of the technology that supports it, arrived, we went overboard in embracing the concept, and really forgot the fundamentals of human nature,” she said. “Whenever you do something that’s alien to human nature, it’s not a lasting trend.” No transaction better encapsulated this renewed belief in office than the massive $3.5 billion commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) refinancing that Tishman Speyer and Henry Crown & Company closed in October on Rockefeller Center in New York City, in a deal co-originated by Bank of America and Wells Fargo “When you think about office recovery, when you get the debt markets to open up that were totally shut, in this case with [single-asset, single-borrower CMBS], it’s a good first step in terms of seeing liquidity re-enter the market,” said Rechler. Others remain skeptical about the long-term health of the office market, especially from a capital markets perspective. Madison Realty Capital’s Zegen noted that with so much value destruction and almost every sponsor refinancing into a higher interest rate landscape, the biggest challenge to the office market remains the inability of investors to get their money back. And, with the office market still anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent of bank balance sheets as well as insurance company and institutional investor allocations, an important part of the capital markets system remains, for lack of a better term, clogged. “It’s hard to reallocate capital into the office sector,” Zegen said. “It’s the albatross of commercial real estate, and, while it will pick it, it’s something that will bog down the system.” With these points in mind, others have examined the improved leasing and occupancy data and have found fundamentals that confirm there is current and future demand for office space across the nation, particularly in the busiest central business districts. “I’m still very bullish on office. I think it’s the most oversold asset class that I’ve seen in my entire career,” said CBRE’s Millon. “People who are taking risk in financing, or selectively buying the right type of office, will be compensated for that.” The other guys It wasn’t just office that returned (somewhat) to form in 2024. The prospects for multifamily, industrial and data centers all brightened during this year of transaction recovery. At just under $100 billion, national multifamily investment sales rose 6 percent compared to the first three quarters of 2023, while, at $30 billion, multifamily institutional investor acquisition volume increased by 53 percent compared to last year, per Newmark data. Yardi Matrix reported that roughly 329,000 apartment units have been absorbed nationally through 2024 and sector occupancy is 94.7 percent, “putting the market in line for one of its better recent years.” “A lot of supply hit the market this year, we’re still expecting more next year, and financing has been challenging, for sure. But the bright spot looking at multifamily this year is that a lot of those high-supply markets are seeing pretty good absorption,” said Dan Dooley, chief investment officer at Coastal Ridge, a multifamily investor and operator. Most importantly, the dreaded need to shore up billions of dollars of multifamily investments made in 2020 and 2021 with cheap, short-term, floating-rate financing turned out to be a chimera, as lenders and sponsors alike discovered that in 2024 much of that gap leverage was ready and waiting to rescue underwater capital stocks through preferred equity and mezzanine debt positions. “In multifamily, we didn’t see the crisis that everyone predicted because the debt markets were super liquid,” said Patrick McBride, co-founder and managing partner at Coastal Ridge. “Multifamily is still a very preferred asset class, and, as banks trafficked out of other asset classes, that liquidity helped support what might have been a bit distressed.” Metrics also turned out strong for the industrial sector, in part because underlying dynamics for demand stayed strong. This was especially true for newer space, even after many tenants overcommitted to space during COVID’s e-commerce boom. National vacancies stood at 7 percent through the first nine months of the year (compared to 3.8 percent in December 2022), but national rents rose by 7.1 percent between September 2023 and September 2024. This was even as supply surged, with industrial completions totaling 283.1 million square feet through the end of September, higher than any year recorded before 2020, according to Yardi Matrix data. Franz Colloredo-Mansfeld, chairman and CEO of Cabot Properties, an industrial owner, investor and operator, said the sector only saw 80 million square feet of leasing through the first three quarters of the year, which was down 60 percent from the same time last year. But demand for newer space exceeded 180 million square feet. “Buildings that are over 20 years old lost occupancy by millions of square feet,” he said. “So the trends you’re seeing in office, with Class A buildings leasing and everything having a terrible time, there’s a little of that going in our business, too.” Ultimately, no asset class established itself in 2024 quite like data centers, which received billions of dollars in fresh capital in anticipation that artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the merging of the internet with the economy will continue unabated into the future. Between now and 2028, global investment in new data center capacity will reach $2.2 trillion, or average $443 billion annually, according to Moody’s Ratings. “I’ve never seen anything like the growth we’re going through right now in data centers,” said Millon, who added a new asset class is “virtually being created overnight” because of AI. “The development wave associated with data centers, particularly around access to power, with long-term investment-grade, hyperscale tenants is unbelievable,” he added. “It’s nothing short of extraordinary.” The Trump bump Speaking of extraordinary, no honest account of the year in CRE could go by without referencing the remarkable political comeback of Donald J. Trump, who became the first president since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s to win two, nonconsecutive terms as president of the United States. After a nearly two-year campaign riddled by indictments, arrests, felony convictions, assassination attempts, and threats of violence that recalled Jan. 6, 2021, the utterly peaceful and normal nature of Trump’s victory brought some calm to CRE circles. “Of all the uncertainty that we had over the several months, the election was one of the biggest factors,” said Colloredo-Mansfeld. “So that’s now behind us, we know who won, and you’ve had a good rise in the market because of that.” However, Trump’s endless penchant for political combat, devotion to high tariffs and massive tax cuts, and his general disdain for governing norms, has given the bond market pause. The 10-year Treasury has stayed above 4 percent since election night. Lee Everett, executive vice president and head of research at Cortland, a multifamily firm, said that Trump’s policy agenda, which includes anywhere from $4 trillion to $7 trillion in deficit spending, has made CRE investors believe inflation may rear its ugly head in 2025. “Deficit spending like that is inflationary by nature, and that doesn’t even get into the labor dynamics,” said Everett. “When you’re looking at a potential policy agenda of limited immigration, deportations, large tariffs and deficit-funded tax cuts, you’re looking at a likely higher inflation environment.” Gigliotii said that, despite whatever Elon Musk might be promising in terms of government efficiency, investors are not betting this will be a cost-cutting administration, and that the market is treating a second Trump term as inflationary. He cited the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) forward curves, which represent market-implied future settings for one-month and three-month SOFR terms, which today are at 4.58 percent and 4.52 percent, respectively. However, Gigliotti said the amount of liquidity out there — and “the sheer desire to transact, the capitulation of sellers, and the pent-up demand of buyers” — will beat out the cost of capital. It’s a sentiment shared by many, as, at the end of the day, regardless of who serves as president, in CRE at least, capital remains king. “There’s so much money on the sidelines,” said Colloredo-Mansfeld. “There’s a general sense in the commercial real estate world that we’ve come through the worst of it and that people are ready to make deals.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Opportunity For Wells Fargo Stock If The Asset Cap Is Lifted?

Wells Fargo in Washington D.C. in the United States of America, on July 12th, 2024. (Photo by Beata ... [+] Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Wells Fargo’s stock (NYSE: WFC) has gained close to 51% year-to-date, as compared to the 28% rise in the S&P 500 index over the same period. In comparison, Wells Fargo’s peer, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is up 42% year-to-date. So what are some of the factors driving WFC stock higher this year, and what lies ahead for the company? While Wells Fargo has seen a strong performance this year, its performance has been mixed in the recent past. Returns for the stock were 61% in 2021, -12% in 2022, and 23% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Recent Financial Performance Wells Fargo reported better-than-expected results for Q3 2024, with total revenues at $20.4 billion, down about 2% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to an 11% drop in net interest income, which the bank has attributed to higher funding costs as customers have migrated to higher-yielding deposit products. Net profits also fell 11% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, due to lower net interest income. That said, the company has been diversifying its revenue sources. Non-interest-related income was up 12% year-over-year during Q3. The wealth and investment management segment performed particularly well, posting a 13% increase in non-interest revenue, driven by higher asset-based fees from higher market valuations as well as increased brokerage transaction activity. The bank also said that its fee-based revenue expanded 16% during the first nine months of the year. Lifting of Asset Cap On Cards? Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve going forward driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Wells Fargo. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Wells Fargo, in particular, could stand to benefit if regulators ease the $1.95 trillion asset cap that was imposed upon the bank in 2018 following its fake account scandal. The cap had made the company scale back on lending and taking deposits, putting it well behind counterparts such as JPMorgan Chase, which now has over $4 trillion in assets, and Citi whose assets total close to $2.4 trillion. Following the scandal, Wells Fargo tweaked its strategy focusing on higher-return businesses as well as less capital-intensive businesses like investment banking. Easing the cap could help the company grow its balance sheet and earnings after years of being constrained. We value Wells Fargo stock at about $67 per share which is slightly below the current market price.

Title: Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Pause Likely Due to Liquidity Factors and Nvidia's Stalled Rally

For the third week, bitcoin (BTC) remains locked in a price range between $90,000 and $100,000, punctuated only by Dec. 5's short-lived rise into six figures.This indecisive price action might have left traders feeling uninspired, with two key reasons holding back the upside. First, the influx of liquidity into the crypto market through channels like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has significantly slowed, taking the wind out of the bullish momentum. The weekly rate of change in the so-called market liquidity impulse index, which tracks stablecoin mints, inflows into BTC ETFs and changes in futures market parameters, has more than halved to $7 billion from highs above $15 billion seen early last month, according to data tracked by 10x Research. "This slowdown in liquidity growth may partially explain why bitcoin is struggling to sustain levels above $100,000," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Wednesday. The liquidity indicator has chalked out lower highs of late, diverging bearishly from BTC's price. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. Meanwhile, ETFs are preferred investment vehicles for those looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. The same can be said about CME's cash-settled futures. The other reason, overlooked by most pundits, is the slowdown in the uptrend in shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's biggest company. Since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, NVDA has emerged as a bellwether for all things AI and risk assets in general. BTC and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and boasted a strong positive correlation since then, barring the summer, when supply overhang fears kept BTC from tracking NVDA higher. As of writing, the three-month correlation between the two was 0.6. Analysts at TheMarketEar believe BTC, with its post-U.S. election surge from $70,000 to $100,000, has caught up with NVDA "Same psychology; winners like winners. BTC has 'caught up' to NVDA. They have little fundamentals in common but are driven by similar psychology," analysts at TheMarketEar said in a note to clients, adding that NVDA is one of the few stocks that has outperformed BTC this year and over the last five years. While BTC has risen 130% this year, NVDA has gained 172%, according to data source TradingView. NVDA's uptrend, however, has run out of steam since mid-November, with prices now teasing a bearish reversal pattern for heads and shoulders. Besides, the one-year put-call skew now shows calls trading at par with puts, exhibiting a neutral sentiment as opposed to a strong call (bullish) bias early this year, according to data source Market Chameleon. That said, bullish excesses have been crowded out from the crypto market, as noted in Tuesday's edition of the Crypto Daybook Americas. With the market normalized to more healthy leverage levels, we could see BTC having another go at the $100,000 mark, but sustainability of the breakout likely depends on liquidity inflows and broader risk sentiment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a technology company, offers custom chip offerings and networking assets that has helped it establish a strong position in the AI space. On December 9, JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $210. With the technology company set to report its earnings on Thursday, the firm remains bullish on the stock on the back of a strong demand profile for AI products, continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets, and unlocked VMWare revenue synergy. Sur affirmed that software renewals from major corporate customers will lead to strong growth in the VMWare business, a cloud computing technology company that Broadcom acquired in November 2023. Overall, the analyst projects revenue and EPS upside for the full year, continued strong demand for AI products, and a coordinated end market recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets for fiscal year 2025. With a $30 billion pipeline of AI revenue opportunities per AI customer over the next 4-5 years, and strong VMWare momentum, Sur projects strong dividend growth and sustained AI leadership for the company. “Broadcom is set to report October quarter (F4Q24) earnings Thursday, and we continued to see a strong demand profile for its AI products combined with continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets (e.g., enterprise, server/storage) and VMWare revenue synergy unlock.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal, State Judges Block Kroger-Albertsons $25 Billion Merger

Time Published: 2024-12-11T01:01:01Z

Two separate rulings on Tuesday stopped the merger of supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons in its tracks. The decisions by U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson and Judge Marshall Ferguson echo widespread concerns about potential negative impacts on competition and consumer choice, affecting millions across the country. Judge Nelson, presiding in Portland, Ore., issued a preliminary injunction after a detailed three-week hearing. Nelson pointed out the likelihood that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is challenging the merger, would succeed in proving that the $24.6 billion deal would substantially lessen competition in the market. The preliminary injunction seeks to preserve the status quo until an in-house administrative judge at the FTC can further assess the merger’s implications. Hours later, in Seattle, Judge Ferguson issued a permanent injunction, specifically prohibiting the merger within the state, citing it as a clear threat to maintaining competitive market conditions. His decision reflects a concerted effort to protect consumers and workers in Washington state from the potential consolidation harms that could arise from such a colossal merger. WESTCHESTER, CA – JULY 10, 2024 – A shopper makes his way down an aisle at Vons market in Westchester which has been serving the community since 1952. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) “We’re standing up to mega-monopolies to keep prices down,” Ferguson said. “We went to court to block this illegal merger to protect Washingtonians’ struggling with high grocery prices and the workers whose jobs were at stake. This is an important victory for affordability, worker protections and the rule of law.” The merger, first announced in 2022, has faced scrutiny from federal and state regulators. The FTC’s lawsuit, supported by attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia, argued that merging Kroger and Albertsons would not only reduce consumer choice but also drive up prices and dampen wage competition in the grocery sector. In response to the court’s decisions, representatives from Kroger and Albertsons expressed their disappointment and are currently considering their next steps, which could include appealing the rulings, NBC News reported. (RELATED: More Americans Turning To Discount Grocer As Prices Skyrocket) “We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs, and enhance customers’ shopping experience. We are carefully reviewing the Court’s opinion and are evaluating our options in accordance with the merger agreement,” Albertsons said in a statement. Both companies have defended the merger as a strategic move to better compete with retail giants such as Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, The Associated Press reported. Albertsons even said that blocking the merger could lead to dire consequences, including layoffs, store closures and an exit from several markets. Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons planned to divest 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to alleviate overlapping market concerns, AP said. The Biden administration initiated a legal challenge in Feb. 2024 against the Kroger Company and Albertsons Companies, Inc. merger, arguing that the $24.6 billion deal stifles competition. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,” Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the release.

Title: Virtualizing GCP data by using Fabric Shortcuts: Data Engineering with Fabric

Time Published: 2024-12-11T00:00:11Z

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

Title: Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nvidia-nvda-stock-declining-230437712.html
Time Published: 2024-12-10T23:04:37Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares continued to slide on Tuesday, falling more than 3% after a Chinese regulator announced that it was investigating the chipmaker for possible violations of the country’s antimonopoly law. On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China. The country’s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so. South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing’s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington’s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China’s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China’s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia’s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe. The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia’s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an “earlier pop”. Historically, December hasn’t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously. Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite a seemingly high forward P/E of 59x, Costco's price-to-membership-fee ratio of 17x and consistent double-digit earnings growth justify the premium valuation. Key Metrics: Devon Energy has established itself as a leader in U.S. shale production, with premium assets in the Delaware Basin. The company's variable dividend policy returns significant cash to shareholders while maintaining operational flexibility. Devon Energy's attractiveness stems from its operational efficiency and shareholder-friendly policies. The company's Delaware Basin operations achieved a 45% return on capital at $70 oil prices, while production costs decreased 8% year-over-year.

The vertical-scrolling webcomic adaptation of FromSoftware's Elden Ring game launched on March 29 on the Tatesc Comics website as well in several ebook stores in Japan. Kadokawa had released a free-to-read teaser for the webcomic in Japanese. The company describes its story: The grand adventure of the action RPG ELDEN RING is now available in full-color comic. The story follows one of The Tarnished who, guided by blessings, reached the Lands Between and sets out on a journey to become the next Elden Lord. Along the way, the Tarnished encounters charming characters, explores various dungeons, battles mighty bosses, and more. Hidetaka Miyazaki (Dark Souls, Dark Souls III, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice) and author George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones) collaborated in creating the game's world. The game won Game of the Year at the DICE Awards, The Game Awards, and The Golden Joystick Awards. The game also won a Grand Award at the PlayStation Partner Awards in December 2022. Miyazaki won the Nebula Awards for Best Game Writing last year for his work on the game. The Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, Best Score and Music, and Best RPG at The Game Awards 2024.

Donald Trump Truth Social 01:11 PM EST 12/08/24… pic.twitter.com/JYamMQeHYr — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 8, 2024 * * * “Trump allies adopt new strategy for nominees: Make the doubters pay” [Politico]. “Donald Trump’s transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth’s hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what’s in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices.” “Growing momentum for Cabinet picks who could define Trump’s second term” [CNN]. “he Cabinet confirmation drama around Donald Trump’s most provocative picks [is] mostly about Trump himself, and the kind of presidency he wants, the one he will end up getting, and the hopes of his MAGA movement that he’ll stand firm on his vow to shake the federal administrative state to its core and enact his and their revenge.” As for Ernst: “The Iowa Republican had faced warnings on social media that she’d encounter a primary challenge in 2026 if she didn’t shelve her reservations about Hegseth. The president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., last week, for instance, amplified a post on X that pointed out that Ernst had been among almost all GOP senators who voted to confirm President Joe Biden’s Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, saying that anyone who did so and then criticized Hegseth was maybe ‘in the wrong political party!'” “‘I Support Pete’: Ernst Changes Tune Following Second Hegseth Meeting” [The Federalist]. “Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, indicated she will confirm Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense on Monday. The announcement marks a stark pivot for Ernst, who has been leading a behind-the-scenes effort to tank Hegseth’s nomination. ‘I appreciate Pete Hegseth’s responsiveness and respect for the process,’ Ernst said in a press release. ‘Following our encouraging conversations, Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women — based on quality and standards, not quotas — and who will prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks. As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.'” “Key GOP senators begin to fall in line to support Kash Patel and keep door open for Pete Hegseth” [CNN]. “Top GOP senators on Monday signaled support for Donald Trump’s plan to oust the current FBI director in favor of firebrand loyalist Kash Patel, while keeping the door open for Pete Hegseth, who faces a slate of misconduct allegations, as the president-elect’s pick to run the Pentagon…. It is still early in the vetting process for Trump’s Cabinet nominees and confirmation votes won’t take place until next year. But it is clear that GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections.” * * * “Cold Shoulder: Democrats Ignore Tulsi Gabbard’s Request To Meet” [CNN]. Worst of all, Gabbard was a DNC vice-chair, but resigned to endorse Sanders. “There is some evidence that skepticism of a muscular foreign policy has gained traction among younger Democrats and independents in the last four or five years. When Hillary Clinton questioned Gabbard’s logic and loyalty, Gabbard punched back. In a series of tweets, she called the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee “the queen of warmongers” and “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.'” • Where’s the lie? The #Resistance “Sanctuary cities resist Trump’s deportation plan. It could cost their residents” [USA Today]. “While a post-election poll by YouGov for CBS News shows that a massive 73% of adults want President-elect Donald Trump to prioritize the repatriation of illegal migrants, the [Denver Mayor Mike Johnston] pledged to not only have Denver police ‘stationed at the county line to keep (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) out’ but also that ‘you would have 50,000 Denverites there.’ Johnston said it would be like a ‘Tiananmen Square moment’ and answered yes when questioned whether he’d be ready to go to jail. That moment soon passed, however, as lawyers apparently explained to the mayor that armed resistance to the federal government is often called – wait for it – insurrection.” • Oopsie. Democrats en déshabillé “Russiagate Remnants” [Michael R. Caputo, Racket News]. “All of us agree the original Russiagate conspiracy continues even today. The Russia hoax was created by Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, who carries on with his lies today as President Joe Biden’s national security advisor. Christopher Steele, the British spy hired by Clinton to create the dodgy dossier, and his Fusion GPS co-conspirator Glenn Simpson are still doing the same work for similar clients. Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, and more still peddle their lies. Elements of the original conspiracy were woven into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 American election, then bogus Trump impeachments, January 6th prosecutions, anti-Trump lawfare, and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Mar-a-lago raid. FBI Director Patel can prove the original 2016 conspiracy continues today. Much of the evidence remains in federal and public databases. Preemptive pardons aside, that means Sullivan, Weissmann, Mary McCord, Steele, Simpson, Victoria Nuland, Alexander Vindman, Eric Ciaramella, Smith, and others may still be in the jackpot. We agree with attorney Mike Davis: these perpetrators potentially violated 18 U.S.C. § 241 and 242, federal civil rights statutes that prohibit conspiracies to violate the rights of others.” • Worth reading in full.

Stay safe out there! Airborne Transmission “AirFanta 3Pro Review – A High-Performance Yet Affordable Air Purifier” [BreatheSafeAir]. “After having the 3Pro set up inside my office for over two weeks now, I am happy to be able to present my full review of the device. For anyone unaware, this purifier is designed to filter a massive amount of air (we will discuss the CADR and more soon!) at a relatively affordable price. It does this by being essentially a pre-assembled CR (Corsi-Rosenthal) Box – a form of air purifier that was itself created due to the need for affordable and effective air purification devices. While the 3Pro doesn’t embrace the typical DIY aspect of traditional CR Boxes, it has the advantage of having proven performance (no need to worry about whether your DIY box is effective!) and being ready to go out of the box. However, perhaps my favourite aspect of this device over traditional CR Boxes is how easily obtainable it is. While this probably isn’t an issue for anyone in the U.S. or Europe, I find it hard to source good HEPA filters in New Zealand at an affordable price. The 3Pro ensures I don’t run into this issue.” • Worth a read if you’re in the market.

Stats Watch Small Business Optimism: “United States NFIB Business Optimism Index” [Trading Economics]. “The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index in the US jumped to 101.7 in November 2024, the highest reading since June 2021, compared to 93.7 in October and beating forecasts of 94.2. It is also the first time in 34 months that the reading is above the 50-year average of 98, in response to the presidential election. “The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners. Main Street also became more certain about future business conditions following the election, breaking a nearly three-year streak of record high uncertainty. Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations”, NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg.” * * * Manufacturing: “Exclusive-Boeing restarts 737 MAX production a month after strike ended, sources say” [Reuters]. “Production resumed on Friday, said one of the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with media. Boeing declined to comment. The production restart had not been previously reported. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Whitaker, told Reuters on Thursday that Boeing had not yet resumed 737 MAX production but planned to do so later this month.” Manufacturing: “Boeing shares jump as 737 MAX production reportedly resumes” [Sharecast]. “The stock was up nearly 5% at $164.80 by 1034 in New York, trading at levels not seen since late-August.” Tech: “AI slop is already invading Oregon’s local journalism” [Oregon Public Broadcasting (PI)]. “The Daily Tidings appears to be the first time an Oregon news outlet has stolen the identities of real journalists to trick local readers with AI-generated content. The goal is apparently to deceive Oregonians into giving clicks — and the resulting ad revenue — to whoever is behind the website.” • Horrid detail. Theft and fraud all the way down.

I believe that people can have rich, fulfilling lives with or without partners; I also know that courtship has never been easy. But research supports the idea that, in recent years, the United States has seen a particularly pronounced crisis of faith in romance. The Pew Research Center, in an analysis of census data, found that as of 2019, 38 percent of adults were unpartnered—that is, not married or living with a partner—compared with 29 percent in 1990. In a survey Pew conducted that same year, half of single adults said they were not seeking dates. When Pew divided that result by gender, it found that 61 percent of single men said they were looking to date or find a relationship while only 38 percent of single women said the same. In other words, straight partnerships seem to be going out not with a 4B-style bang but with a whimper. And however subtle the shift might seem, it has huge implications for men and women: how they treat each other, whether they’re willing to trust each other, and how they’ll build their futures—together or apart.” • Hmm. Guillotine Watch “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” [Yahoo News]. Better there than in the corridors of power at the EU and NATO. Oh, wait…. “A German property developer has sparked outrage with a plan to turn a World War II tunnel system into a luxury bunker for rich survivalists who fear the outbreak of World War III. Relatives of the prison labourers who built it under the Nazis are aghast at the business venture that is offering a crypto-currency called ‘BunkerCoin’ as entry tokens to the promised apocalypse shelter.” • Of course, Crypto. Class Warfare “The Tech Baron Seeking to Purge San Francisco of ‘Blues'” [Gil Duran, The New Republic]. April 2024. “‘What I’m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,” [Balaji Srinivasan] said.” • Oh. News of the Wired “Colour in the Middle Ages” [Medievalists.net]. “Michel Pastoureau writes that “the true medieval opposite for white was not so much black as red.” This can be seen in the way Europeans adapted chess. When the game was adopted in Europe, the pieces and chessboard were painted in white and red, contrasting with the black and red sets common in India and the Middle East. It was only towards the end of the Middle Ages that the white versus black dichotomy became more favoured. A key factor in this shift was the advent of printing, where black ink was used on white paper, reinforcing the perception of these colours as natural opposites.” “Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension” [Educational Research Review] 2018. From the Discussion: “The results of the two meta-analyses in the present study yield a clear picture of screen inferiority, with lower reading comprehension outcomes for digital texts compared to printed texts, which corroborates and extends previous research (Kong et al., 2018; Singer & Alexander, 2017b; Wang et al., 2007). These results were consistent across methodologies and theoretical frameworks.” And: ” our results indicate that the screen inferiority effect has increased in the past 18 years, and that there were no differences in media effects between age groups. These surprising findings suggest that we cannot idly wait for screen inferiority to disappear as children are exposed to digital devices earlier and earlier in their lives, as adults gain more experience with the technology, or as technology improves. The data suggest that screen inferiority is a major challenge across age groups that becomes more severe as the presence of technology increases.” • Certainly conforms to my priors! * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Printed books, cards, and tabletop games come in handy during power outages. Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension I have been harping on this for some time, especially in regards to NC content. Good meaty posts and whenever Yves tells me to get a cup of coffee means I invariably copy and paste the words into a word processor and print it out. One could also hit the “Printer Friendly and PDF” at the end of the post, but I prefer the fancy OpenType fonts I have already installed in the word processor. Reading text on paper as opposed to monitors and phones will save your eyes, and your comprehension and memory of the content will be deeper. For example, I printed Rob Urie’s post today on the state of greedy health insurance. Of course, this means I miss out on participating in the comments. i have an old trailerhouse full of books. i call it “The Library”. but i can no longer read any of them without getting a headache or eyestrain. because i cant afford to go to the eye doctor(after almost 9 years) to get new real eyeglasses. so i’m stuck with “walmart readers” of varying magnification…yellow/green ones for in here in my bed, with laptop at the foot of it….purply ones for out at the bar…brown ones for in the truck…last actual prescriptions, held together with caulk, superglue and tape, in the golf cart. on the laptop, whether here, in bed, or out at bar, i an make these letters frelling huge, and do just that. i reckon that more healthcare executives need to be shot on the side of the road for the message to get through,lol. “Access to Healthcare” makes a nice slogan you can yammer on about…and your PMC healthcare might be awesome….but i have none at all….as do so very many of my compatriots. and when we hear how awesome obamacare is, in Texas, well…look over yer shoulder for the rest of your natural, and likely artificially extended, life. (i’m busy thinning the damned catherd, so have no bullets to spare) Meanwhile, back at the gerontocracy ranch: https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5032783-mcconnell-falls-medical-attention/ I appreciate your explanation of end of term legislation. The need however for members of Congress to express disdain for a civilization of 1.4 billion thoroughly benign people is saddening. At least this can be otherwise dismissed. Thank you so much. I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern. It is quite valid. And it is possible the same bill will come up in the next Congress, but it has to start from scratch – find sponsors, go through committees, etc. Congressional procedures can be arcane. These guys know how to work it. “I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern…” You are terrific. Where’s the lie? There isn’t one of course, which is a problem because truth and trust are the costly enemy, but lies, ignorance, and hatred are their profitable friends. And the Democrats reflexively, without any deliberations, destroy anyone who they think is the enemy Indeed. I think Gabbard will be the hardest nominee to confirm. She will be opposed by all Democrats of course. But most of the Republicans are also warmongering hawks. None of the other nominees, including Patel, have dared to question our foreign policy as openly as she has. Mumbling vaguely that we shouldn’t “get involved” in certain foreign conflicts is not the same thing as visiting Syria, saying Assad is not our enemy, and condemning our use of Islamist extremists as proxies against him. She will have her words thrown back in her face, forcing her to either dissemble with some sort of patriotic mush or stand by her words and admit “our government” was lying. What will she say about Assad now, for example? I think it may rather be what will Syria have to say about itself between now and any confirmation hearing. That is a two month window to find out what the uni-party has created and whether there will be calls for boots on the ground there, the responsibility to protect those helpless wheat fields and benign oil reserves. By the time of her confirmation hearings, Syria will be a Jihadist cesspool and nobody will have any appetite for putting boots on the ground. The repercussions of the fall of Syria will be plain to see and Gabbard will not be shy in pointing this out. Old Joe took the credit for Assad’s fall so now the consequences will be on the Democrats. By the time Gabbard hearings happen, our formerly cuddly Jihadis will be at war with Israel. (Heck, the way IDF is invading deep into Syria, it could start before the year is out.) That will cause some interesting contortions. For all we know, the shooter didn’t expect to survive. Perhaps he didn’t expect to survive, particularly given that he apparently suffers from severe chronic back pain. I had a friend who did himself in with pills and booze because of it. In any event, he’s become a cause celebre. Should he survive incarceration and not go the way of Epstein, his trial will be quite something. I wonder how deeply his defence will be allowed to explore and explain his motivation to a jury as a powerful mitigating circumstance, essentially putting the healthcare system on trial. I suppose jury nullification is a possibility but probably too much to hope for. I am sorry about your friend. I have (or had) a close relative who did the same at the age of 57. And now I too have the same back condition, though I avoid booze and pills. It really does put limitations on one’s life and a pall over one’s outlook. I can imagine it must be even more upsetting to a younger person — since you know will have to live with it that much longer. yeah. back problems are the worst. out of all my numerous broken bones and other sundry injuries to my skeleton, the 2 old, self-healed compression fractures in my back are the worst, by far. especially with cold fronts, hurricanes, etc. nothing you can do to get away from it. mine are likely from hauling feedsacks on one shoulder when i was much younger. nothing radicalisises you like constant pain, and an indifferent and uncaring healthcare system…but yer likely too frelled up to go all crazy like Luigi did. i sure as hell couldnt. my skeleton prevents travel. lucky for the aristocracy, i suppose. (yes, feeling murderous, tonight,lol….let lindsey graham or some other warmongering asshat wander in front of my truck tomorrow, and we’ll see…if i see them…in time.) Hannah Arendt noted that “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists.” Two things on the accused Adjuster. First, while a rapid arrest was no doubt greatly wished by TPTB, I’m not sure the guy they got, regardless of guilt, is the one they wanted or needed. This is someone, who with family, can take this to a trial where a guilty verdict is highly unlikely and where the defense will air a lot of facts and figures our politicians and Big Health (Insurance, private health providers, health services and Big Pharma) really really do not want to get a lot of air play. And even having a friendly judge will not help them, because anything they deny for the defense will be being aired in public regardless. Second is just amusing, had a conversation with a NYC police officer today about how so much of the surveillance video I see really does not provide enough detail for people to really recognize people or cars, especially since the general NYC public uniform of black clothing becomes a black blob. They threw in that they didn’t understand why the Adjuster went to Altoona and didn’t just stay in NYC. Mostly because for all the surveillance it really isn’t as comprehensive and easy as we think and with so many people it is much easier to just blend in with the crowd. Maybe the Adjuster believes that the surveillance system in NYC is more all-powerful than the systems in other places. However, I notice that that NYC police officer either assumes that NYC Guy and Altoona Guy are the same guy, or he wants everyone hearing/reading his words to assume it. I for one do not assume it. So I have no way of knowing whether NYC Guy ever went to Altoona or not. Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. And it can leave lasting issues in maybe most patients that are worse than the original issue ever was. If we wanted to set the DOGE police on medicine, one of the easiest low-hanging fruits would be the abuse of back surgery. 35 years ago – the rule was – No back surgery unless the patient is paralyzed (or with a clear imminent impending paralysis) and there is possible hope of reversing that. THE END. Now there are surgeons doing “minimally invasive” procedures 10 times a day. It seldom works well. And it can be castastrophically tragic for many. This is ESPECIALLY true of the morbidly obese – they should lose weight. And the young jock types – they should be doing core work and extra training – not surgery. The problem with doing this on a young athlete is their life, their exercise and their ability to perform will never be the same. And this does not go well for so many of them. The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. We have a chronic pain problem here in the USA – we have completely out of control expectations and it leads to so many tragedies. Always remember – this one issue has been what I would call the “nexus” of the opioid epidemic. When these surgeries go bad – and they almost always do – the patient is left in varying degrees of horrific pain – ready to self-medicate or worse. And always remember – this type of surgery is a HUGE moneymaker for Big Hospital – there are entire hospitals across the land that do nothing but this. It is ripe for fraud – and this has played out among back surgeons going to jail all over this country. And never forget the story of Dr. Death. Again – I have no qualms about the DOGE dogs being unleashed on this. Something must be done. Thanks. One of my aunts had back surgery and everything you just said. I’m old enough to have arthritis, which runs in the family, and for awhile could barely walk due to swollen knees. Ever since I’ve tried to walk a couple of miles per day and don’t have any trouble at all with my legs. Of course younger people may not have the time to take walks. But perhaps you have to avoid the magic bullets as one gets older and go old school. IM Doc Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. [ This is precisely what the chair of orthopedics at Harvard explained at a dinner. ] Forgive me for not be clearer. As I understood the chair of orthopedics, the problem was in using surgery for pain that could be and should rather be resolved by physical therapy or routine exercise. Much back pain can be resolved, I learned, by strengthening stomach muscles with bent-knee sit-ups. In college, there were a number of helpful exercises that wrestlers used for their backs, rowers as well and even for me as a runner. I was only repeating in summary dinner comments that stayed with me. I, for instance, as a runner, used bent-knee sit-ups for my back each day. Amen. “Core Strength” is key to a healthy life and old age; balanced back and front work that keep your body working normally. However, most people would rather die and be disabled than to arse themselves to work on this. Thankfully, my orthopedic Docs at Stanford, one for back, another for knees, are both strong proponents of physical therapy, reserving surgery as a last resort. Just to balance the narrative – I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer. I went from being unable to walk to being fine. For a pain free and full mobility quarter century, I am most grateful. The only lasting effect is a slight weakness on the side that had the pinched sciatic nerve, and that was much worse before the surgery. I do believe physical therapy after surgery helped in my case. Pretty much the same with me. Had a herniated disc and had to use a walker to get anywhere. The surgery was straightforward and recovery quick. However, I believe any fusion of back bones should be avoided. “I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer…” I much appreciate the balancing, and am pleased for you. A Doctor partially paralyzed my step grandpa after a back surgery gone wrong. He retired as a City Bud Driver and had chronic pain. Then why do the insurance companies approve these procedures? To sell profitable pain killers for years through their pharma subsidiary, at least that’s what United Healthcare does. How does back surgery mesh with the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) cheer-leaders, or do profits put a thumb on the scale? (I’m still having problems wrapping my head around US-backed Jihadis promising Diversity and Democracy.) That’s only because you think they believe or mean those promises. If you decide to believe that they are being coached to say it for the cameras for the time being, then you won’t have problems wrapping your head around it. Remember the deathless words of Erdogan. ” I see that Democracy is like a bus. I get on it and ride till it gets me where I want to go. Then I get off.” I don’t believe in anything except the Kalama Sutta and I watch what the hands are doing. To paraphrase Sid Arthur from 2500 years or so ago, “Go kick a rock.” The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. Years, in my case. 12-24 months after starting I was still getting episodes, and things were better but not by all that much. It felt like I was making no progress. Somehow I kept at it and things did change (slowly) and today after >10 years I’m barely troubled by it any more. I know it’s still there – sometimes something sets it off – but it’s a minor niggle for a few days and doesn’t prevent me from doing anything I want to do or cause any serious discomfort. It used to wipe me out completely for weeks on end. I think what kept me going was noticing small improvements in things I hadn’t even realized were a problem. After 6-12 months I could stand for longer than an hour without needing to sit down. I hadn’t even realized that was abnormal. I realized that if I stopped, things would just keep getting worse. aye. guy who did my hip replacement actually warned me away from any back surgery to fix these compression fractures….and the big ortho outfit he worked for had that as a big part of their business model. and, please IMDoc, remember that not all of us long term opioid patients are junkies. the vicodin doesnt remove the pain, but it does mitigate it( i miss it when i miss a dose)…and when i do my every 2 or 3 year drug holiday to reset the receptors and start again at 5mg, i have had zero withdrawal symptoms. careful with big brushes,lol. Great post, thanks. Working hard to keep my back muscles strong enough to never develop chronic pain. And worried sick my 80-something friends are going down a similar road with the electrophysiologists, so very eager to implant devices in anyone with sometimes-erratic heartbeats. A lifesaver, sure, for some. A really nice money-maker for them? Also sure. It makes me leery. I am lucky that my back pain was managed by the VA, who had undertaken a whole new approach to pain management. No opiates and invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary. Wholistic approach which included education, physical therapy, “non-traditional” procedures like acupuncture, and very mild, non-opiate based painkillers as necessary. I did undergo ablasion, which certainly helped. The combination of all of these has kept me reasonably pain-free for five years now, with occasional flare-ups which I can manage using the knowledge gained from the pain-management classes, with massage, acupuncture and exercises. All in all, it has allowed me to remain active and go on long hikes with reasonable weight load. The question is, why don’t private insurers stimulate more hospital systems to go to that approach? I am reasonably certain that my care was both cheaper, monetarily and socialy, and more effective, than what’s being offered to the privately insured. Ernst is playing a role. Can’t have Thune, protégé of Turtle, get sullied with any pre-nomination discourse or controversy. Keep that powder, or those favors, for future matters. Meanwhile, Ernst gets some press visibility. Win-win for the Shell game and Turtle legacy protection. A question: Will NC take a closer look at Romania and the annulled election? It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal, if one takes the notion of free elections in the EU seriously. It is a de-facto Russiagate à la roumaine that has changed the outcome of a political process for real. That is quite something. Taibbi should be looking into this….(did he?) Romania is also interesting since it’s a textbook case of old and new elites realigning after ’89. The place never came to peace. Which is why people don’t take politics there seriously. It’s pretty tragic and ugly. “It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal…” Given the givens, I’m surprised that you’re surprised. The bit of MSM news I saw recently accentuated the dastardly deployment of Russian backed social media as being responsible for voters making an unacceptable choice. After the Moldovan President was re-elected based on the votes coming from the Moldovan diaspora and not those living in Moldova, it is no surprise. Ursula is centralizing as much power as she can in Brussels so I can see a day when it will be Brussels that will dictate the authenticity of an election held and maybe even who is allowed to stand for office. More of those “EU values” that we keep on hearing about. Well, they just canceled election because they lost, and the reason given is far more ridiculous than the original Russiagate. So I guess there is not much to talk about, if the Romanians themselves accept it without fight. Maybe that’s the actual message, that everyone sort of accepts EU is fixing election right and left, like nobody was making big fuss about the fairness of latest “election” in USSR. Don’t forget that Pres Yoon of SK claiming thst he ordered martial law as a measure against electoral fraud. Re: Don’t throw away your printed books […] I am eagerly awaiting my option to subscribe to NC in print! re: “Don’t throw away your printed books: I am divided on this. Do I really read F Scott Fitzgerald differently, do I process it differently when reading it as a printed book in contrast to reading it on an e-book reader? How deep does the scientific evidence reach here? Is it merely external phenoma that are measured? Or more substantial internal matters? How far can brain functions be identified with 100% certainty and connected with genuine different results? Is it due to the technology itself? Or due to the notion of multi-tasking? Which would have nothing to do with possible inferiority of the technology of reading on digital devices as such. I can’t comment about e-readers because I don’t own one, but my experience tells me that I undoubtedly process words better on paper than on screen. And by “process” I don’t necessarily mean high level deep emotional processing (prefrontal cortex, amygdala) but rather lower level visual processing (retina, thalamus). Reading nice serif fonts on paper affords me less eye strain and fatigue, which could indirectly allow me to better comprehend the content of the text I am reading. You ask some very tough questions about how we can even measure brain functions and how it relates to reading comprehension. I don’t have a good answers, but you can still reap benefits of not reading all day on screens. It’s like intuitively understanding that eating lots of un-manufactured and unprocessed vegetables is a great idea even if you don’t have a good understanding of how digestion affects health. NC’s favorite contributor, Michael Hudson, agrees in his most recent article on how publishing monopolies are squeezing writers. Hudson laments screens causing him eyestrain and the publishers insisting on using tiny print with ugly typefaces on the paper versions. As knowledgeable as Hudson is, he probably doesn’t have the clout to dictate the typography in his books. (Whose poor idea was it to not include an index in Killing The Host? I doubt it was Michael himself.) Edward Tufte certainly has the clout to tell publishers how to style and design his books. Take a look at Tufte’s books. They have the most beautiful graphic design and typography. (I believe Tufte commonly uses the Sabon font in his books.) Needless to say I grew up a printed book person. However I am asking the “devil’s advocate’s” questions because I lack some knowledge on this that you might have and others on NC. Meaning: the serious scientific scholarship on this. Those who’s jobs in publishing it is to read books for real were the first ones who – as my circle of friends is concerned – were all with the “digital revolution” simply for practical reasons. There are as you say all sorts of issues involved. My underlying question is indeed if it hade made a difference to me had I grown up with the same titles but not in print but well readable digital devices. A nice cruel experiment with twins growing up! As you and matt below point out, various needs make for various purchases. The most common I guess is print for reading and making notes (I at least cannot read and making notes on digital devices. It makes serious research impossible.) But the second purchase is the pdf to research studies which I already have worked through or for works that I have no time to check. (Admittedly a practice more often used due to commenting on blogs which is not a paid job after all. So at some point time is an issue.) But still the questions that you already pointed at for me (prefrontal cortex, amygdala /retina, thalamus) – are the ones of a normative magnitude. It’s like with mask mandates during Covid: Do masks not work because the virus slips through the material. Or do they not work because people are too lazy to use them properly or at all. From the scientific POV two completely different answers. But mixed in the public arena. As the quality of publishing goes – I believe so far Germany in this area is still a safehaven if you work with one of the Classic publishers and not some online outfit or self-publishing (which I would assume lacks the money). On the other hand I have encountered micro-trends where certain publishers fell for new trendy fonts which I found detestable. Thanks also for the Hudson link. US capitalism is full of surprises… my sister likes collecting printed books ‘in case something happens.’ and i agree it is nice to have paper books for power outages. but as a student, i am NOT about to purchase and lug around 5 massive textbooks all day. if you’re reading a book for fun, printed copies are nice. but for other reasons, they are not. or when it is wet. they are two technologies with different uses. sometimes you need a book but it’s expensive so all you have is a pirated pdf. also it’s easier to read in bed on your phone. instead of holding a flashlight under the sheets like i used to as a kid, i can simply read on the phone. I have to do log book entries for my work as an aircraft mechanic. Sometimes they are 500 to 1000 words. Filled with part numbers and manual references. I learned along time ago that I can’t proof read on the computer screen. I print it out and make corrections. Then print on sticky paper and paste in the book. re: Don’t Throw Away Your Printed Books Here is the link to the article, which at least on my screen, did not come through: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300101 ‘Donald J.

One whiff of that and you will be willing to bankrupt your entire country to give Zelensky all the billions that he wants. What do people think of the alleged manifesto by alleged American folk hero The Adjuster, Luigi Mangione? https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto “To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn’t working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.” But when he goes to trial, will the judge rule that inadmissible in court? Gotta watch those New York courts Why would it be inadmissible? Self-incrimination? But it was written before he was arrested. If it is admitted into court, then that brings the whole question of why he did what he did. Is that a can of worms that the courts want to open? The state of American healthcare? It would be safer to declare him insane and put him away and not go there. The big question is did Luigi actually write this. Commenters on Twitter are saying that it doesn’t read like his other posts online, like his GoodReads reviews. Also, I just can’t get my head around why someone who went to such lengths not to get caught and managed to escape NYC would then allow himself to get caught. At least turn yourself in to make the political statement. So much that seems unaccountable. Why did he stay ten whole days in New York? And in a hostel that requires in-person check-in and in which you’d be sharing a room with other guests? As for the final sentence, “I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty…” a kind of invitation to other adjustors? Mind you, no way on earth I would take up that invitation even if I can’t begrudge anyone who does. Sounds less Marxist than German Red Army Faction. But the gist is the same. The last couple of years made it difficult for people to further promote and believe in the idea of constructive grass-roots movements changing matters down to top. For some time now left groups had mostly abandonded force, violence, murder. Wonder how long that remains. Might we see more of this? I haven’t followed this closely as I usually don’t like murder stories. (However the sane political rationale makes it more interesting of course.) I wouldn’t be surprised if this event was instrumentalized as another pro-Dems story confirming the fears of violence under a Trump administration. Simply by Trump being there. Even without any proven affiliation. As of “the billionaire”-class won etc. re: “ Why did he stay ten whole days in New York?” He had theatre tickets? wanted to see the tree at Rockefeller Center? Skating in Central Park? The “Sienna” exhibit at the Met Museum (It’s very good)? “Frau Ohne Schatten” with Nina Stemme at the Met Opera ? (Also good). why does anybody stay in NYC for 10 days? Amazing that he had the time to gun anybody down. 😂 would make for a great comedy: “The man who wanted to be assassin.

He learned the hard way that the US is not agreement-capable. He should have been reading alt-media … next time call crime stoppers, and let the perp walk! About that ” don’t throw away your printed books” article . . . I wonder whether people who learned to do their high-level reading on printed text are able to comprehend text on screens just as well as if it were printed. The reason I don’t throw away my printed books is so that I will still have something printed if/when the entire Internet and the entire digisphere goes dark and stays dark for good. Interesting. But then we did once have to learn how to read paper books and for some of us that happened very early. So I think the point is that it’s really about what’s in the books and the technology is a sidebar. Personally I did have trouble adjusting to reading ebooks and found that making the screen presentation–sharpness, serif text, a preferred two page per screen format–as much like a real book was the way to go. For this reason the old e-ink Kindle was a pain. There are Bezos’ good ideas and–so many–Bezos’ bad ideas. Meanwhile computer displays are now very sharp indeed and the contrast is unbeatable. Now I have trouble reading paper books. Of course paper copies of books should be kept somewhere and we once thought and perhaps still think this is the public library’s job. But it seems they aren’t into being archivists Most libraries nowadays are actively landfilling books so they can build studios to teach the kids how to Tiktok. Because that is what the kids need to know. Too bad we don’t have a Carnegie to donate the money and dictate that the libraries should do something other than what the Propaganda Broadcasting System (PBS) tells them is relevant. “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” Of course where Dachau is located would make a great site for rural-residential living in a new gated community and conveniently situated near Munich. Why yes, there will be guards but they will be for keeping people out, not like the previous ones that had the job of keeping people in. The MSM has been talking about how people need to switch to “secure” communications on their cell phones becasue of Chinese hacking, but apparently, it’s MUCH more serious than that. The “secure” communications apps used by the US government have been penetrated.

Looks like a back door left in the telcom software for the FBI/DOJ was used to gain access. This sounds like good news to me. I don’t care if the Chinese want to listen to my conversations with my wife, but if they can get some information that helps them to prevent either of our demented presidents from starting WW3 then I am all for it. > Chinese Hack Means Beijing Reading and Hearing All US Military and Intelligence Classified Phone Communications Good..

Wow: Scott Horton in an interview about Ukraine with German daily BERLINER ZEITUNG?! What is going on? German language: https://archive.is/nmsYX I might post a translation later if it’s worth it… Horton: I’m afraid the situation in Ukraine is so difficult that Trump will have a hard time making a deal. The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a resounding defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But the Ukrainians and Americans should be reminded that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelenskyi not to negotiate with Russia, but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. Agreed. But Trump will need to cut Ukraine loose quickly. Otherwise it becomes his tar baby. Koreans get creative in protest methods amid martial law fallout https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/12/113_388213.html At 11 a.m. Wednesday, a group of citizens in their 20s and 30s staged a funeral ceremony for the ruling party in front of its headquarters in Yeouido, Seoul. The group sentenced the party as “politically dead,” demanding its dismantlement. This is a very long post. But I can’t provide a link only since an archived article cannot be auto-translated. At least I wouldn´t know how. – Scott Horton Interview BERLINER ZEITUNG – “The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost” – Scott Horton in an interview The representatives of an aggressive US foreign policy bear a large share of the responsibility for the war in Ukraine, says the American author Scott Horton in an interview. The war in Ukraine is currently reaching a turning point. The Ukrainian army seems to have little left to oppose the Russian army. President Volodymyr Selenskyj has admitted that he will have to come to terms with ceding territory to Russia. Will there be peace negotiations under US President Donald Trump? The American radio presenter and publicist Scott Horton has examined the history of the war in his new book “Provoked. How Washington started the New Cold War with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine”. The Berliner Zeitung spoke to him about the long-term goals of the USA, the role of Angela Merkel and possible peace scenarios. Mr. Horton, the war in Ukraine has been raging for almost three years now. The USA is Kiev’s most important ally. What are the long-term goals of the American government in Ukraine? It’s complicated. Essentially, they want to integrate Ukraine into the so-called American security umbrella and install a government that is friendly to them. Russia has been pressured with NATO’s constant eastward expansion. Of course, Russia’s neighbors wanted American protection. But the problem is that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to a country like Ukraine, which is of paramount importance to Russia. When the US declared that Ukraine should become a member of the Western security architecture, a threshold was crossed. The US has been playing out NATO membership for Ukraine since the 1990s. But the smartest members of the American leadership have always warned against it. Ukraine’s history and Russia’s history are deeply intertwined. Russia has a significant strategic interest in the Sevastopol naval base in Crimea. The American strategy of integrating Ukraine out of Russia’s sphere of interest and into the Western sphere of influence became a direct threat to Russia, provoking a reaction. Would you say that the American government underestimated Russia? The part of the American establishment that was counting on further western integration of Ukraine did not think that Russia would invade Ukraine. I recall the words of Senator Chris Murphy, who praised the US role in overthrowing the government on television after the so-called Maidan revolution of 2014. Murphy said: “We did a great job.” The moderator then asked whether this might not provoke a conflict with Russia. Murphy replied: “That would be crazy.” He assumed that Russia would not intervene. A few weeks later, Ukraine lost Crimea and the east of the country was at war. In her biography, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest. What effect did Merkel’s decision have at the time? Well, the so-called hawks, who stand for an aggressive American foreign policy, argue that if Ukraine had been given far-reaching military commitments at the time, the war would not have started in the first place, because Putin would not have attacked any NATO member. I think the more plausible answer is that Russia would have immediately launched an invasion of Ukraine, even before the NATO treaties were signed. The then US President George W. Bush was warned. The American ambassador to Russia, William Burns, wrote a memorandum in February 2008, published by Wikileaks, entitled “Njet means Njet. Russia’s Nato Enlargement Redlines”. In it, Burns warned his boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, against bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. It was not just about Putin. For the entire Russian security apparatus, this would have crossed a line. In his memoirs, Burns later reported an email to Rice in which he explained to her what a sensitive point the issue was for Russia. Merkel and French President François Hollande did everything they could to stop Bush. But Bush was determined. They agreed to a compromise not to guarantee Ukraine a NATO membership process, but only that Kiev would one day be given the prospect of a NATO membership process. Merkel’s stance against Bush was in line with the leadership of the American security services and the US State Department. So was it a far-sighted decision by the then German Chancellor? Merkel was deeply concerned about provoking Russia. She did not think about what economic costs Germany would face in the event of a military conflict. The only question was, why should she provoke Putin if Germany could not gain any benefits from it. While President Joe Biden has always been a strong military supporter of Ukraine, his successor Donald Trump has announced that he will stop military aid to Ukraine. Why do the Democrats in the US have a stronger interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I am not sure if that is the case. The political right accuses the Democrats of money laundering and shady dealings in Ukraine. I do not know anything specific about that. I think the scandal surrounding Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who is said to have received bribes from Ukraine is not decisive. It starts earlier: Hunter Biden was installed at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings to protect the company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevskyj. Zlochevskyj was closely linked to the government of the fugitive President Viktor Yanukovych. That is why he sought protection from the Americans. Burisma hired Hunter Biden, as well as the former CIA officer Cofer Black and the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. To return to your question: Do the Democrats have a greater strategic interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I would put it this way: the bipartisan consensus in US foreign policy is absolutely in agreement with Joe Biden. The new right that supports Trump is against an interventionist US foreign policy. The Republican establishment, such as the Republican minority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, is fully in line with the aggressive US foreign policy of George W. Bush, John McCain and Joe Biden. Their main concern now is damage limitation. The USA suffered a devastating defeat in Ukraine. It is just like in Afghanistan and Vietnam. The USA financed the war for years and millions of people died. In the end, the Reds were in Saigon, and today the Taliban are back in power in Kabul. The USA has plunged Ukraine into terrible chaos. In order to effectively push Russia back, the USA would have to station its own soldiers in Ukraine. But the price of a nuclear escalation would be too high for that. The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost. The willingness of the American public to continue supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia is declining. Why do the majority of Americans no longer support the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky? Because it is obvious that we have been lied to. They said we will support Ukraine against Russia for as long as it takes. But it was supposed to take a year or two. The media often tell the joke: “Russia has the second strongest army in the world. But it looks more like they only have the second strongest army in Ukraine.” But now the war has been going on for three years, and the leading newspapers in the USA agree, and Zelensky is also aware, that Ukraine will have to give up territory. The American public is not so interested in what is happening in Donetsk Oblast. They are much more concerned about the fact that bridges are eroding in their own country and that their own government is abandoning them in the event of serious natural disasters. When Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina in September, the U.S. Army could have provided assistance. There are several locations in the state. Where were the Blackhawk helicopters to rescue Americans from the floods? They were in Europe supporting NATO and on their way to the Middle East. As people in North Carolina were fighting for survival, President Biden announced that another billion-dollar package for Ukraine would be approved. This is a major point why the Democrats lost the presidential election. The war in Ukraine pushed the German economy into recession. Since then, Germany no longer imports cheap gas from Russia, but expensive LNG from the USA. Is this just a combination of unfortunate circumstances? The Germans are the collateral damage in America’s economic war against Russia. The aim was to prevent as many Russian gas exports to the West as possible and to drive Russia into national bankruptcy. But that is not working. Russia is now exporting its gas to the East. American geostrategists, such as George Friedmann from the think tank Stratfor, discuss it surprisingly openly that the absolute priority for the USA is to separate Russia from Germany. The function of NATO is to keep America in, Germany down and the Russians out, as the first NATO Secretary General Lord Ismay described it in 1949. An alliance between Germany, the industrial superpower, and Russia, the resource superpower, would dominate Eastern Europe and destroy the influence of the Americans and British in the region. It is no coincidence that Senator Ted Cruz from my home state of Texas was a staunch opponent of the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline during the Trump and Biden years. Texas produces much of the American LNG that the US profitably supplies to Germany. Victoria Nuland, the former European representative at the US State Department, said to Cruz: “Well, Senator, what you always wanted has happened: Nord Stream 2 is a lump of metal on the seabed.” The Ukrainian president is increasingly losing support among the population. Do you think he will be able to hold on if Ukraine continues to go on the defensive? Zelenskyy has strengthened his power by suspending the presidential election and imposing martial law. It will depend on whether there will be powerful challengers who can offer an alternative. It also depends on which part of the population you ask. The further west you go, the more often you get the answer that the fight against Russia should continue. If you go to the east of the country, you are told to rely on negotiations. A serious problem is that neo-Nazis are gaining strong influence in Ukraine. Dmytro Yarosh and Andrei Biletsky have threatened Zelensky and his predecessor Petro Poroshenko with death. New York Times journalist Andrew Kramer has reported in detail on the danger posed by these people. They are actual descendants of Hitler’s collaborators in Ukraine who fought in World War II. They do not want to accept a ceasefire. For them, it would be a betrayal of the many soldiers who died in the war. They do not want to give up until they have won. If Zelensky starts peace negotiations, he will be in serious danger in the country. So, how will things turn out in Ukraine: Will we see peace in the next few weeks? I fear that the situation in Ukraine is so difficult that Trump will have a hard time making a deal. The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a crushing defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But it is worth reminding Ukrainians and Americans that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelensky not to negotiate with Russia but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. But there are still some doubts as to whether Trump is even seeking peace with Russia. After all, he has chosen many hawks for his government team. And he is in no position to make any demands on Moscow. Given the current military situation, Putin can draw the border pretty much wherever he wants. The question is whether he will expand to Kharkiv and Odessa, or whether he will just annex the oblasts he already controls. The optimistic scenario would be an agreement that freezes the conflict and draws the border where it currently is. Your email address will not be published.

But on Tuesday, after he presented a proposal at Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting, the shareholders said no. In October, Microsoft told investors that the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, intended to submit a shareholder proposal recommending that the software company's board look at diversifying its balance sheet with bitcoin. Saylor, now MicroStrategy's executive chairman, has seen his company's stock price soar almost 500% this year as it buys billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. "Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave, and bitcoin is that wave," Saylor said in a video presentation, which he released on X last week. The post has more than 3 million views. In his three-minute presentation, Saylor displayed a chart showing that bitcoin generated annual returns of 62% between August 2020 and November 2024, compared with 18% for Microsoft and 14% for the S&P 500. Bonds as an asset class have lost 5%, the presentation says. "You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into bitcoin," Saylor said. "If you do that, you'll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price." The virtual appearance Tuesday wasn't the first time Saylor has made the pitch to Microsoft, which was sitting on $78.4 billion worth of cash, equivalents and short-term investments, as of the end of September. Microsoft said in its proxy filing in October that its treasury and investment services team previously evaluated bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund the company's operations and reduce economic risk, and "continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making." A day later, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X. "Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me," Saylor wrote. The proposal failed to garner support from a majority of voting shareholders, after Microsoft recommended they reject it, with just 0.55% of votes in favor, according to a Wednesday filing. Proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both suggested a no vote, too. Microsoft started accepting cryptocurrency for customer payments in 2014, Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said in response to a shareholder question during Tuesday's meeting. "We continue to think about the evolution of crypto," she said. Microsoft shares have gained about 19% so far this year, far underperforming MicroStrategy. But Saylor has tied his company, now valued at about $83 billion, directly to the fortunes of bitcoin. In mid-2020, the company, which had been a middling software business, announced its plan to invest in bitcoin, disclosing in an earnings call that it would commit $250 million over the next 12 months to "one or more alternative assets," which could include digital currencies such as bitcoin. At the time, MicroStrategy's market cap was about $1.1 billion. As of Dec. 8, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries owned a total of about 423,650 bitcoins, acquired at an aggregate price of roughly $26.5 billion. With bitcoin trading at $95,000, those holdings are worth over $41.3 billion. MicroStrategy has been selling stock and raising debt to help fund its bitcoin purchases. The company said on Nov. 21 that it had completed a $3 billion convertible debt sale "to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes." Saylor's net worth has ballooned to $9.1 billion, according to Forbes, primarily due to his MicroStrategy ownership. WATCH: Michael Saylor on MicroStrategy and bitcoin Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Pixtral 12B is now available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/pixtral-12b-is-now-available-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T18:21:22Z
Full Content:
Today, we are excited to announce that Pixtral 12B (pixtral-12b-2409), a state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) from Mistral AI that excels in both text-only and multimodal tasks, is available for customers through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. You can try this model with SageMaker JumpStart, a machine learning (ML) hub that provides access to algorithms and models that can be deployed with one click for running inference. In this post, we walk through how to discover, deploy, and use the Pixtral 12B model for a variety of real-world vision use cases. Pixtral 12B represents Mistral’s first VLM and demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming other open models and matching larger models, according to Mistral. Pixtral is trained to understand both images and documents, and shows strong abilities in vision tasks such as chart and figure understanding, document question answering, multimodal reasoning, and instruction following, some of which we demonstrate later in this post with examples. Pixtral 12B is able to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike other open source models, Pixtral doesn’t compromise on text benchmark performance, such as instruction following, coding, and math, to excel in multimodal tasks. Mistral designed a novel architecture for Pixtral 12B to optimize for both speed and performance. The model has two components: a 400-million-parameter vision encoder, which tokenizes images, and a 12-billion-parameter multimodal transformer decoder, which predicts the next text token given a sequence of text and images. The vision encoder was newly trained that natively supports variable image sizes, which allows Pixtral to be used to accurately understand complex diagrams, charts, and documents in high resolution, and provides fast inference speeds on small images like icons, clipart, and equations. This architecture allows Pixtral to process any number of images with arbitrary sizes in its large context window of 128,000 tokens. License agreements are a critical decision factor when using open-weights models. Similar to other Mistral models, such as Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Mixtral 8x22B and Mistral Nemo 12B, Pixtral 12B is released under the commercially permissive Apache 2.0, providing enterprise and startup customers with a high-performing VLM option to build complex multimodal applications. SageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch. With SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. The models can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia powered instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune the model, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability.With SageMaker, you can streamline the entire model deployment process. Note that fine-tuning on Pixtral 12B is not yet available (at the time of writing) on SageMaker JumpStart. To try out Pixtral 12B in SageMaker JumpStart, you need the following prerequisites: You can access Pixtral 12B through SageMaker JumpStart in the SageMaker Studio UI and the SageMaker Python SDK. In this section, we go over how to discover the models in SageMaker Studio. SageMaker Studio is an IDE that provides a single web-based visual interface where you can access purpose-built tools to perform ML development steps, from preparing data to building, training, and deploying your ML models. For more details on how to get started and set up SageMaker Studio, refer to Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic. Deployment starts when you choose Deploy. When deployment is complete, an endpoint is created. You can test the endpoint by passing a sample inference request payload or by selecting the testing option using the SDK. When you use the SDK, you will see example code that you can use in the notebook editor of your choice in SageMaker Studio. To deploy using the SDK, we start by selecting the Mistral Nemo Base model, specified by the model_id with the value huggingface-vlm-mistral-pixtral-12b-2409. You can deploy your choice of any of the selected models on SageMaker with the following code: This deploys the model on SageMaker with default configurations, including the default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. The end-user license agreement (EULA) value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA. Also, make sure that you have the account-level service limit for using ml.p4d.24xlarge or ml.pde.24xlarge for endpoint usage as one or more instances. To request a service quota increase, refer to AWS service quotas. After you deploy the model, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. In this section, we provide examples of inference on Pixtral 12B with example prompts. We use the following image as input for OCR. We use the following prompt: For chart understanding and analysis, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: We get the following output: For an image-to-code example, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: After you are done, delete the SageMaker endpoints using the following code to avoid incurring unnecessary costs: In this post, we showed you how to get started with Mistral’s newest multi-modal model, Pixtral 12B, in SageMaker JumpStart and deploy the model for inference. We also explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including other Mistral AI models, such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x22B. For more information about SageMaker JumpStart, refer to Train, deploy, and evaluate pretrained models with SageMaker JumpStart and Getting started with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to get started.

The stock's worst day of 2024 had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 69% for the year, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999. After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate. Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle's cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue. "A bit of a stumble here for a stock that's created some lofty expectations for itself," wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said "we still like oracle heading into 2025." For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57. Oracle's biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers. The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement. Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 "based on continued cloud momentum." They cited Oracle's cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

Title: Tech Workers Are Flocking To Financial Services
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/12/10/tech-workers-are-flocking-to-financial-services/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:26:09Z
Full Content:
As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language ... [+] processing and large language models is growing. As artificial intelligence increasingly serves as a key driving force in business strategies across all sectors, this shift is altering the labor market, allowing technology workers to explore opportunities beyond their traditional industry. The tech job market, while more tempered compared to recent years, remains robust in the financial sector. Major banks are actively pursuing talent, attracting a significant influx of skilled professionals to their ranks. While tech firms continue to be the primary employers of recent tech graduates, the financial services industry is gaining ground. At Cornell University, the proportion of computer science graduates entering the financial services sector increased from 16% in 2022 to 22% in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College saw a rise in the percentage of master of information systems management graduates choosing careers in financial services, from 16% between 2018 and 2021 to 19% between 2020 and 2023. This sustained demand for tech expertise in banking reflects the industry's ongoing digital transformation, which provides technologists with opportunities to develop patentable innovations. Generative AI has the potential to create substantial value across the banking sector, including wholesale and retail segments. The fast-emerging technology is projected to contribute an additional $200 billion to $340 billion in value to the industry, according to McKinsey research. In addition to AI, financial institutions are also investing heavily in areas such as blockchain and cybersecurity, necessitating a continuous pipeline of specialized talent. In 2024, the tech industry faced a challenging landscape, with more than 525 companies cutting approximately 150,000 positions, according to Layoffs.fyi. This widespread reduction in headcount is further exacerbated by the growing risk of conventional tech roles becoming outdated or diminished due to the advancement of AI. The Bay Area, which is the leading tech hub for major corporations and startups, experienced a significant wave of job cuts in its technology sector during the second quarter of this year, due to changing market conditions and economic pressures. Tech companies disclosed intentions to cut over 7,000 positions in the region, as reported by Mercury News. The 7,062 job losses marked the most substantial quarterly reduction since the first quarter of 2023, when the industry eliminated more than 10,000 roles in what was previously thought to be the height of tech layoffs. The latest national employment data shows limited movement in the tech workforce. According to the November jobs report from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the tech unemployment rate slightly decreased to 2.5%, matching the lowest level recorded in 2024. However, employment in the tech sector remained largely unchanged, with a marginal decline of 1,636 jobs during the month, an analysis by CompTIA, an organization specializing in IT certification and training, revealed. In stark contrast, emerging professionals view the financial sector as the most promising career path in the current economic landscape. A 2024 Global Graduate Outlook Survey by CFA Institute, a not-for-profit organization that provides finance education, found that 30% of respondents identified financial services as the sector they have the most confidence in, marking a six percentage point increase from 2023 and maintaining its top ranking for the second consecutive year. As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language processing and large language models is growing. Consequently, employers are placing a greater emphasis on AI skills in their recruitment strategies. Recent EY research indicated a surge in corporate AI investments, with widespread adoption across surveyed companies, as 95% of senior leaders report ongoing AI investments. Notably, there's a substantial increase in high-value AI commitments, with the percentage of companies planning to invest $10 million or more in AI expected to nearly double from 16% to 30% in the coming year. Goldman Sachs projects that global AI investments will approach $200 billion by 2025. Capital One and Bank of America secured positions among the top 15 companies obtaining AI-related utility patents, joining prominent technology firms such as Toyota, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and IBM, according to patent consulting firm Harrity & Harrity. Moreover, Citigroup expanded its workforce by adding 8,000 technologists between 2022 and 2023. The bank had previously announced its intention to aggressively hire around 2,500 tech professionals in 2020, including coders, engineers and data analysts, to enhance its trading and investment banking divisions. Additionally, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Well Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are deploying AI and machine learning within its businesses. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Microsoft Shareholders Vote Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal

Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:04:10Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT) doesn't appear to be adding its name anytime soon to the list of corporate entities holding bitcoin (BTC) after its shareholders voted against a proposal that would have directed the board of directors to study such a move. Titled "Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin," the proposal was put forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research. The think tank group suggested that Microsoft should consider diversifying 1% of its total assets into bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. According to the latest data by Bloomberg, Microsoft holds $78.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The board last month had urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. The preliminary vote result was announced minutes ago at the company's annual meeting. Shares of MSFT were trading for $446 in the minutes after the decision was announced, roughly flat for the day. Already under pressure on Tuesday, bitcoin prices fell a bit more following the news, now lower by 4% over the past 24 hours to $95,700. A 3-minute presentation by Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has seen its stock price surge as much as 2,500% since adding bitcoin to the company’s treasury strategy more than four years ago, was meant to convince shareholders otherwise. Saylor argued that Microsoft had surrendered $200 billion in capital over the past five years by issuing dividends and stock buybacks instead of purchasing bitcoin. From the beginning, though, Microsoft's board had concerns over bitcoin due to the inherent volatility of the asset. The company, according to the board, prioritizes stable and predictable investments to mitigate as much risk as possible.

Title: Sonos Arc Ultra review: don’t call it a comeback (yet)
URL: https://www.theverge.com/24315195/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-more-bass
Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:01:29Z

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Sonos really needed a great product right now. 2024 will be remembered as the year that Sonos nearly torpedoed its brand with the haphazard, premature rollout of an overhauled mobile app. This led to an unprecedented outcry from loyal customers who faced myriad bugs, diminished system performance, and other issues. Many called for CEO Patrick Spence to step down. That didn’t happen, but Sonos has spent the majority of this year on the back foot with apologies, turnaround plans, and assurances that a setback of this magnitude will never happen again. It’s under these undesirable circumstances that Sonos has released the briefly delayed Arc Ultra soundbar. The $999 Ultra is designed to improve on what was already a very capable Dolby Atmos soundbar. After many hours testing the Ultra, I can say it resoundingly succeeds. Software missteps aside, Sonos can still deliver on hardware. The Ultra is a notable improvement in basically every regard, and a worthwhile upgrade — if you’re ready to trust Sonos again. The original Arc arrived during a high point for the company that its executives must desperately miss, back when demand for its products was soaring amid the covid-19 pandemic. The Arc was a strong performer that delivered an impressive level of immersion from a single soundbar, though some customers experienced a loud popping sound caused by a bug that took the company far too long to fix. The Arc had other weaknesses, with bass response at the top of that list. Unless you paired the Arc with a Sub (or the Sub Mini that came later), the soundbar didn’t have enough low-end bite to make you feel the booms and reverberating explosions in Hollywood blockbusters. It’s a downside shared by many soundbars and an inevitable tradeoff that comes with the form factor. In 2022, Sonos spent $100 million to try and overcome that by acquiring a small company called Mayht Holding, which had developed a “revolutionary approach to audio transducers” that allowed them to be smaller and lighter without compromising on sound. The Arc Ultra is the first time we’re seeing that technology in an actual product. It’s being used for a new “SoundMotion” woofer built into the soundbar that produces twice as much bass as the original Arc. It’s a cool-looking thing, and here’s a TL;DR on how it works from Sonos’ press kit: - Distributed lightweight motors displace more air for added bass. - Aerospace-grade aluminium ribs connect the motors for combined power, allowing a smaller enclosure. - Four pairs of opposing magnets power four voice coils for bigger sound in a smaller enclosure. - Reinforced force-cancelling cones minimize vibration for clearer sound. This compact, relatively flat woofer design freed up enough space for Sonos to cram even more drivers (14 in total) inside the Arc Ultra. The original Arc had 11. Such an arsenal of speakers is good enough for the Ultra to deliver a 9.1.4 surround experience. That’s what Sonos’ marketing claims, at least. Don’t get hung up on the numbers; several of those are virtualized phantom channels, and this is still a soundbar at the end of the day. What’s objectively true is that the Arc Ultra produces a soundstage that’s noticeably wider and more dynamic than its predecessor. And it does so in a cylindrical enclosure that’s similar in size and overall design to the original, though this one’s a bit shorter — nice if your TV is on a stand like mine — and slightly longer. The touch controls have been relocated to an upward-facing panel at the rear of the soundbar, with the Arc Ultra now sharing the same button layout as the Era 100 / 300 and Move 2. Hands-free voice commands also remain, though Google Assistant is no longer available. You can use Amazon Alexa, Sonos Voice Control, or both simultaneously. One welcome upgrade is a Trueplay feature called Quick Tune. Like other recent Sonos speakers, the Ultra can use its built-in microphones to tune itself for your environment — without requiring the manual Trueplay process of moving around the room while waving your iPhone around. This means Android users can finally take advantage of Trueplay, or at least this faster version of it, which wasn’t possible on the first Arc. iPhone owners still have the option of doing a more thorough tuning like before. I didn’t notice a meaningful difference between the two, but you might, depending on your room layout. Bluetooth audio playback is also supported on the Ultra after being MIA on the original Arc. There’s a pairing button at the back of the soundbar beside the ethernet jack and microphone mute switch. AirPlay 2 is still on board, and the Ultra makes the jump to Wi-Fi 6 for more dependable wireless performance. Something Sonos hasn’t addressed is the lack of HDMI passthrough. Other premium soundbars let you plug in a game console or disc player without sacrificing another HDMI port on your TV, but Sonos clearly favors simplicity here. I tested the Arc Ultra in three different setups: first by itself; then with the also-new Sub 4 ($799); and lastly with the Sub 4 and a pair of Era 300 speakers as rear surrounds. Even on its own, the improvements over the original Arc are obvious and plentiful. The Sound Motion woofer delivers on its promise, giving the soundbar more oomph and a thicker low end that will likely be more than enough if you’ve got a small to medium-sized living room or are living in an apartment with people below you. Putting bass aside, the Ultra simply has greater clarity, dimensionality, and depth than the Arc. The height effects are more convincing, and everything sounds more expansive without getting thin or too dispersed. I was as captivated by The Wild Robot at home as I was seeing it at an Alamo theater. The Ultra beats out the Arc for music, too. Whether it’s Atmos tracks like Kacey Musgraves’ “Sway” or regular stereo, Sonos’ Sound Motion tech and the added drivers make a difference. I still do most of my music listening elsewhere given the choice, but for relaxing on the couch, this does the trick. Dialogue clarity is also fantastic and the other major reason to consider upgrading from the Arc. Even without enabling the speech enhancement feature, which now has three levels to choose between, the center channel is more impactful. I could clearly hear Christian Bale’s voice over the roar of engines in Ford v Ferrari. Guy Ritchie’s Snatch is an old favorite (and good test for dialogue intelligibility), and it posed no problems for the Arc Ultra. Bringing in the Sub 4 levels up the bass from good to stellar. This configuration also allows the soundbar to concentrate on treble and midrange frequencies, while the dedicated subwoofer takes care of rumbling bass. And yes, if you throw in the pair of Era 300 speakers, you get the full Sonos Dolby Atmos experience. It’s blissful and can be downright mesmerizing, which is what I’d hope for from a bundle that costs over $2,500. If you’re interested in digging into frequency response charts, check out Andrew Robinson’s great YouTube review. Whether used solo or as a package, Sonos has a winner on its hands that can outshine the best from Samsung and other brands. But none of that matters if you can’t rely on the software that controls everything. So, what about the beleaguered new app? My experience during this review was surprisingly headache-free. None of my speakers randomly vanished from the system, and controlling the Arc Ultra was responsive and worked as intended. Adding the Sub and surrounds went off without a hitch. It was all very encouraging, but I fully understand that some people are still having a frustrating time with the app. And new problems continue to arise: early on, there was a Trueplay bug with the Arc Ultra that nerfed bass response. That’s since been resolved, but Sonos needs to keep the performance enhancements and bug fixes coming into the new year and well beyond. Just recently, I’ve seen numerous complaints about a bug that’s badly hampering the Era 300’s surround sound performance — and this affects owners of the original Arc, too. Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the Sonos Arc Ultra, you must agree to: Using Amazon’s Alexa assistant also means agreeing to Amazon’s Alexa terms of use. Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one or more optional agreements. The Arc Ultra is an excellent product and a crucial step in the right direction. It’s a significant improvement over the original and easily in contention for the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy. But this is only one step, and whatever comes next will be the true indication of just where Sonos is headed. If the rumors of a video streaming box are true, Patrick Spence and Co. better have a compelling justification for moving beyond Sonos’ core audio business. The damage from the app episode will be lasting, and it has already led to layoffs and rendered the Ace headphones all but forgotten in less than a year. After going through this ordeal, I wouldn’t blame anyone for holding off on the Arc Ultra until Sonos proves it’s capable of making good decisions again. The company isn’t out of the woods yet. Not even close. But it still knows how to make a damn good speaker, so there’s hope.

Title: The Omnicom-IPG megamerger signals a new era for the ad industry

Hello. Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate, has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday and initially faced local gun and forgery charges. Our team has been covering this developing story — keep up with our coverage here. In today's newsletter, the $13 billion Omnicom-IPG megamerger reflects a new era as Big Tech and AI upend the ad industry. What's on deck: But first, a new ad-venture. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's already been a big week for the ad industry. Omnicom Group said it had reached an agreement to acquire Interpublic Group, a merger worth more than $30 billion that would create the world's largest ad conglomerate. Across the pond at Paris-based Publicis Groupe, the party hats might be staying in the drawer. Just last week, Publicis recruited Snoop Dogg for a video to help celebrate the firm usurping London's WPP to become the world's largest ad holding company. But it's not just about being No. 1. For ad industry insiders, the proposed takeover reflects an ad sector under threat from Big Tech and AI, writes Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. By creating a larger company, Omnicom-IPG will have a bigger base to deploy data and technology, which could give it leverage to secure beneficial and exclusive deals with partners such as cloud providers. Keep in mind, however, that in the short term mergers can be highly disruptive. Concerned clients. Bruised egos. Job cuts. Integrating two companies with 100,000 people combined, dozens of different agency brands, and hundreds of offices across the globe will not be a simple task. There will likely be synergies — including job cuts. "It will be harder to climb the career ladder. Superstar creators and creatives will also be in demand, as well as good strategists, in all disciplines. But, lots of other roles will become diminished," Simon Francis, who leads the marketing consultancy Flock Associates, told BI. However, as Lara highlights, that could create opportunities for smaller agencies, especially as the merged company works its way through the disruption caused by integration, egos being knocked out of joint (it wouldn't be the first time), and potential client conflicts where the new entity suddenly works with two or more fierce rivals in the same sector. "From an M&A perspective, it's only going to add fuel to the fire." That's according to William Ritchie, founding and managing director of advisor firm WY Partners. "I'd expect there is going to be more competition for the best assets and more focus on building a streamlined data and tech-first offering which can compete," he told BI. Private equity has been circling the ad industry, too. Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone have shown interest in media and entertainment. Industry insiders have speculated for months that WPP could be taken private — or at least some parts of it could be. The Insider Today team: Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire co-founder, had his net worth cut by $15 billion Tuesday as the company’s stock paced its worst loss in nearly a year, after a recent earnings report that fell short of estimates, though analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm. Analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm despite a recent earnings report. Oracle’s shares fell by more than 7% to below $177 as of around 11:40 a.m. EST, the biggest plunge for the stock since Dec. 12, 2023. The value of Ellison’s roughly 42% stake in Oracle—totaling more than 1.1 billion shares—decreased from $218.2 billion at Monday’s close to $203 billion Tuesday. On Monday, Oracle reported $14.06 billion in second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47, both of which fell just below analyst projections of $14.1 billion and $1.48 per share, respectively, according to FactSet. Despite missing estimates, analysts indicated Oracle’s cloud business will likely fuel its growth: Of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet, none lowered their stock price target for Oracle and 14 raised their projections, including some that have the stock returning close to its record intraday high of $198 set on Monday. Revenue from Oracle’s cloud services rose 12% year-over-year to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue, the company said. Investment firm D.A. Davidson said in a note Tuesday that Oracles’ cloud infrastructure “remains heightened” as demand for AI-based computing continues to grow.

Ellison is the world’s third-richest person with an estimated net worth of $220 billion, which decreased by about 6% on Tuesday. Oracle’s chairman ranks behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, currently the second-wealthiest in the world, though the two have traded ranks multiple times in recent months. Bezos’ fortune increased by nearly 1% ($2.4 billion) to $242.3 billion Tuesday as Amazon shares rose slightly. 83%. That’s how much Oracle’s shares increased this year as of Monday’s share price of $190.45. Oracle, a database software firm co-founded by Ellison, has succeeded this year alongside a rising demand for AI-based technology. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank analysts said Oracle achieved a “triple crown” after reaching partnerships with cloud computing giants Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Oracle also recently signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media firm to use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure to help with projects related to Meta’s Llama language models. Oracle raised its guidance for its 2026 fiscal year in September, saying the company expects to generate about $66 billion in revenue shortly after announcing the company would take orders for “computing clusters” built with Nvidia’s GPUS. The product was touted by Oracle as the “largest AI supercomputer in the cloud.” One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Dan Niles on Nvidia (NVDA): People Just Want to Believe ‘Santa Claus Rally’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks this Week. Paul Hickey, Bespoke Investment Group co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that despite the market gains still concentrated in a few names, he’s bullish short and long term because of AI. “The longer term play is the AI trade. This is an AI bull market. Every bull market has a theme, and ChatGPT was to AI what Netscape and AOL were to the internet.” Hickey also mentioned the possible scenario where market gains would start to broaden out. “ChatGPT didn’t invent AI; it made it tangible for consumers and businesses, just like Netscape with the internet. It caused, you know, made it a lot more practical on the part of businesses and the consumer. So I think in that respect, there’s a lot more investment to go, and we’ve seen the infrastructure stocks in AI benefit. But even just last week, some of these software names—and we’re going to slowly start to see that broaden out to the rest of the economy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Commenting on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) results last month, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that when Nvidia said in its call that the demand would surpass supplies for the next “several quarters,” it set the bar lower for those who “believe the dreams.” “They just reset the bar lower. Things are going to accelerate as you go into next year, and so, depending, you’re in a really great seasonal time of year for stocks. People just want to believe in the Santa Claus rally.” Niles then made his case for the expected slowdown and reality check for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the future: “You’re going to, at some point next year, run into an issue where you’ll need to see a return on investment for the money you’re putting in. Think about Microsoft—they cut estimates after the June quarter report and again after the September quarter report. At their Ignite conference, they even mentioned hitting a wall, potentially with scaling loss. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia’s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers — which account for 50% of its revenue — are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia’s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins. Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA’s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA’s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA’s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company’s revenue, which presents added risk.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks this Week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY?

The logo of e-commerce company Ebay is pictured at an exhibition booth for vehicle parts at the ... [+] Essen Motor Show in Essen, western Germany on December 4, 2024. (Photo by Ina FASSBENDER / AFP) (Photo by INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images) We believe that the internet retail company eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is currently a better pick over the apparel retail company, Lululemon stock. Although these companies are from different industries, they belong to the consumer cyclical sector and share a similar revenue base of around $10 billion. EBAY stock trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus 5.0x for LULU. We think this gap in valuation will narrow in favor of EBAY in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think EBAY will outperform LULU in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. Separately, check out What’s Behind The 80% Rise In META Stock? EBAY stock has seen gains of 45% from levels of $45 in early January 2021 to around $65 now, vs. an increase of about 15% for LULU stock from $350 to $405. This compares with 60% gains for the broader S&P 500 index over this four-year period. However, the increase in these stocks has been far from consistent. Returns for EBAY stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 49% so far in 2024, while that for LULU stock were 12%, -18%, 60%, and -22%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 28% so far this year — indicating that EBAY underperformed the S&P in 2022 and 2023, and LULU underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2024. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including PG, and AMZN, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 the last 3 years over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. eBay has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 5% from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.3 billion now. On the other hand, Lululemon’s average revenue growth rate of 30% from $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 (fiscal ends in January) to $10.2 billion now has been comparatively much faster. eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher gross merchandise volume and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Lululemon’s revenue growth lately has been driven by strong growth in China and international markets. For perspective, China sales were up a whopping 67% y-o-y in 2023, and another 39% so far this year. China now accounts for 13% of the company’s total sales, versus 8% in 2021. However, the company’s largest market – the Americas region – is seeing tepid growth lately, up just 2% for the nine-month period ending October 2024. This can be attributed to a change in consumer spending trends and rising competition. Looking forward, we expect Lululemon to see a high-single-digit average growth rate in the coming years, led by continued growth in China, versus a low single-digit rate for eBay. eBay’s operating margin fell from 29.6% in 2020 to 19.2% in 2023, while Lululemon’s operating margin expanded from 19.3% in fiscal 2021 to 22.9% in fiscal 2024. If we look at the last twelve-month period, Lululemon’s operating margin of 23.3% fares better than 21.3% for eBay. Lululemon’s profitability is superior compared to some of its peers, including Nike, with operating profit margin of 11.8% and 9.2% for On Holding. For eBay, the decline in profitability lately can be attributed to increased spending on R&D to improve its product experience. From a financial risk perspective, eBay seems to have an edge over Lululemon. Its 25% debt as a percentage of equity is slightly lower than 26% for Lululemon, while its 45% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 17% for the latter. This implies that eBay has a better debt position and has more cash cushion. We see that LULU has seen better revenue growth and is more profitable. On the other hand, eBay has a better financial position. Now, looking at valuation, we think EBAY is the better choice of the two. EBAY, at its current levels of $65 trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 2.8x over the last three years. In comparison, LULU stock trades at 5.ox trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 6.7x over the last three years. However, for LULU, a decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the slowing sales growth from around 30% average rate in the last three years to a high single-digit expected growth rate in the next three years. The company also faced a backlash after the launch of Breezethrough leggings, with a V-shaped back seam, earlier this year. The product received negative reviews at large, and the company decided to pull the product from the market. Lululemon also faces increased competition in the athleisure market. Overall, we think LULU stock is overpriced at levels of around $400, while EBAY may offer some room for growth in the coming years, as it focuses on improving the GMV using generative AI capabilities. While EBAY may outperform LULU in the next three years, it is helpful to see how eBay’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: What’s Behind The 80% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/

GERMANY - 2024/12/01: In this photo illustration, a Meta Platforms Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] monitor. (Photo Illustration by Valera Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) is up 5% in a month, with investor optimism around the TikTok ban. A federal appeals court recently upheld a law requiring TikTok’s owner ByteDance to find a new owner for its U.S. operations, outside of China, by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. If TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., it would have been a positive for Meta, with less competition in the social media space. See how two other tech stocks compare in Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock. Even if we were to look at a slightly longer term, META stock has outperformed, with 83% returns since early 2022 — rising from levels of $335 then to around $620 now — vs. an increase of 28% for the broader S&P 500 index over this period. This 83% growth can be attributed to: Let’s dive deeper into these factors. Separately, check out our take on EBAY – Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY? Meta Platforms is the world’s most popular social network that helps people connect with family and friends. The company makes money primarily through advertising, which it provides to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on information posted by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue has risen 32.5% from $118 billion in 2021 to $156 billion for the last twelve month period. This can be attributed to rising ad impressions as well as an increase in the average price per ad. Also, Meta’s family daily active people have risen 17% from 2.82 billion in 2021 to 3.29 billion now. Most of the company’s revenue comes from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only has the company’s sales risen in the last three years, its net income margin has expanded from 33.4% in 2021 to 35.6% now. Meta’s shares outstanding also declined by 8% over this period, thanks to the $122 billion the company spent on share repurchases. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion and fewer shares resulted in the company’s bottom line of $21.17 now, up 54% from $13.77 in 2021. Investors have rewarded Meta stock lately, as the rise in both ad impressions and average price per ad bodes well for the company’s sales. Furthermore, the company’s AI push is expected to help it generate higher advertising revenues, with an increase in user engagement and more effective targeting. Furthermore, what may go well for Meta is the TikTok ban in the U.S. But, ByteDance has recently filed an emergency motion with an appeals court seeking a temporary block on the ban from taking effect. [1] Meta stock declined nearly 2% after the news report of TikTok filing an emergency motion emerged. At its current levels of $615, META stock is up a solid 74% this year. However, the increase in META stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think META is fully valued now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, slightly below the current market price. META stock is now trading at 29x trailing earnings of $21.17 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. Although a slight rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately, investors should take into account the risks. It’s still unclear how significant a boost AI can be for the company’s earnings growth, which makes the continued aggressive investments in AI a slight risk. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta Platform’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: This mid-range gaming laptop feels like the forgotten middle child, and isn't difficult to understand why
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/lenovo/lenovo-legion-5i-gen-9-review
Time Published: 2024-12-10T15:00:00Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) feels extremely familiar to other mid-range Legion laptops of the last few years in that it's unapologetically 'chonky,' but still delivers reliably excellent gaming performance in a reassuringly sturdy chassis. It certainly doesn't wow outside of being a gaming laptop, but more odd is how forgotten this laptop feels in the current Legion lineup (and how surprisingly difficult it was to track down where you can buy one). Sturdy, practical design with healthy port selection Excellent gaming performance and thermal management Comfortable and responsive keyboard Attractive pricing, especially with frequent sales Feels oddly placed between the Legion Slim 5i and Legion Pro 5i laptops Definitely not suited for anything outside gaming and graphically intensive work Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The Lenovo Legion line of gaming hardware and accessories has continually expanded over the years to the point where Lenovo even created the new LOQ brand specifically for its budget gaming devices. • Pricing & specs• Design & build quality• Display quality• Performance & thermals• Battery experience• Keyboard & everything else• Competition• Score card & final thoughts That's been great for giving customers choices, and Lenovo has become a very reliable recommendation for those seeking a straightforward, dependable gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5 line dominates the mid-range category, and the Legion 5i (Gen 9) I've been testing sits in the middle of that family. It's a familiar experience with a practical and hefty design, excellent gaming performance, and reasonable pricing. It'd be an easy recommendation, except it awkwardly sits between the longer-lasting Legion Slim 5i and the more powerful Legion Pro 5i like the neglected middle child — and if you do some shopping, you'll notice that Lenovo and retailers alike are far more likely to recommend the Slim and Pro variants to you than this one — even if I'd sooner suggest this laptop before its Pro big sibling. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. • Price: ~$1,609.99-$1,949.99 at Lenovo• Display: 16-inch IPS LCD, 16:10 aspect ratio, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600) resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 350nits max brightness, anti-glare coating, non-touch, Dolby Vision HDR support, NVIDIA G-SYNC support• CPU: Intel Core i9-14900HX (24 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.8GHz)• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8GB DDR6)• NPU: None (Lenovo LA1 chip for Lenovo AI Engine+ support)• RAM: 32GB DDR5 @ 5,600MHz (2x 16GB, SODIMM)• Storage: 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD• Battery: 80Whr, Rapid Charge Pro support w/ 230W adapter• Dimensions: 359.7 x 262.3 x 19.7-25.2mm (14.16 x 10.33 x 0.78-0.99in)• Weight: 2.36kg (5.2lbs) Pricing and availability for the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) are odd, to say the least. Most retailers you'd first go to for all your laptop buying needs aren't likely to offer this laptop at all (Best Buy selling both the Slim and Pro variants is a great example of this), and even Lenovo sells few pre-configured models and somewhat limits your choices in its custom configurator. The only shop I could find my exact review configuration was Costco, of all places. That's alright, though, because the Intel Core i9 inside my unit seems a little overkill when paired with the rest of the internals. The most affordable Legion 5i (Gen 9) straight from the source is $1,120.99 at Lenovo (at least at the time of writing), which gets you a Core i7-14650HX, RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD in a well-specced, balanced mid-range gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5i custom configurator starts from $1,239.99 at Lenovo at the time of writing, giving you more options but costing you a little more across the board. Either way, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) consistently costs less than the Legion Pro 5i, with the only differences being a gently more compact design, barely different port selection, and slightly worse overall performance. In the box, you'll find the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9), a proprietary 230W DC charger and adapter, a 3-month subscription for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a replaceable rear vent plate with a blue accent color (versus the default flat grey). Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) — Buy now at Lenovo ($1,120.99 at time of writing) This variant of the Lenovo Legion 5i is powered by an Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. At the time of this review Lenovo lists this with a ridiculous retail price of $1,789.99, but the discounted $1,120.99 is an excellent price for this laptop. 👉See at: Lenovo.com If you've seen one Lenovo Legion laptop in the last few years, you've essentially seen them all. Sure, there have been refinements and improvements made over the years, but Legion devices have remained remarkably consistent over time. The Legion 5i is like the Legion Pro 5i and Legion Slim 5i — it makes no attempt at being the thinnest or lightest gaming laptop. This is just a really practical design that feels incredibly durable and reliable. The Legion 5i is actually thinner (~25.2 vs. ~26.8mm) and lighter (2.36 vs. 2.5kg) than the Legion Pro 5i and puts all of its vents on the rear and bottom. This means your ports are more spread out, but overall, it's a very similar configuration. You get one USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with 140W Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a second USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort 1.4, three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports (one is always on), and HDMI 2.1 port that supports up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz, an RJ45 Ethernet port, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. For comparison, the Legion Pro 5i loses the microSD card reader but gains a fourth USB Type-A port. Finally, there's the familiar 230W DC charging port, which supports up to 300W for more powerful configurations. The Lenovo Legion 5i feels familiar once again when you look at its display. It's the same panel across the entire Legion 5 lineup, actually (with the exception of an optional 240Hz configuration), meaning you're looking at 16 inches of QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600), 165Hz IPS LCD goodness. This display isn't likely to wow you at any point, but it's solid across the board and offers reliable, smooth performance when gaming. 99% of the sRGB and 78% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts means you shouldn't rely on this display for any creative work, but this display is consistent. It gets decently bright, its contrast ratios are good for an IPS LCD panel, and its white balance, while warm, is level across all brightness levels. Dolby Vision HDR support is also technically here, but this isn't a screen I'd rely on to consume high-quality HDR content. When gaming, this display is smooth and responsive, with NVIDIA G-SYNC support putting a halt to potential screen tearing. Performance is where you'll most wonder if you really need to spring for the more expensive Lenovo Legion Pro 5i, as the Legion 5i (Gen 9) boasts many of the same configuration options and is able to perform admirably with that hardware. Its only real flaw is that these fans are extremely loud, enough that the speakers aren't quite enough to drown them out. You'll want a headset for gaming. With the same CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, and display options, it's hard at first glance to see the difference between the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) and its more expensive Pro sibling. Really, it comes down to the Pro 5i having more thermal headroom due to its beefier chassis and being able to put a little more wattage into its components. On paper, this means the Legion Pro 5i is the more powerful laptop, and this is reflected in benchmarks. That doesn't make the Legion 5i slow, though. This laptop kept up with more expensive machines well, and in real-world performance and gaming, you're not liable to see much of a difference between the Legion 5i and the thicker, heavier Legion Pro 5i, including in gaming. Achieving stable 60 frames-per-second in most PC games at high settings is very reasonable with the Legion Pro 5i, and if you lower the resolution to 1080p (which will still look great on a 16-inch display), you can take better advantage of that 165Hz refresh rate. I also stress tested the Legion 5i's thermal management with 25 consecutive loops of 3DMark's Time Spy benchmark, and a 99.6% framerate stability proves this laptop's capable cooling system. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) carries the same 80Whr battery cell as the Legion Pro 5i and Slim 5i, and its endurance sits in between the two. Lower wattage likely contributes to the Legion 5i outlasting its Pro sibling, but it can't compete with the efficiency of the AMD-powered Slim 5i, which is one of the longest-lasting Legion laptops. In Procyon's One Hour Battery Consumption tests, the Legion 5i drained 22% while simulating a standard Microsoft Office workload and 24% when looping an HD video at 50% volume. Around 3-4 hours of regular usage isn't unreasonable with the Legion 5i, but this is still far from a battery champion and not a laptop I'd recommend for mobile work. Once again, the Legion 5i is a familiar tale here. Wholly focused on its role as a gaming laptop, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) simply isn't exciting or interesting in a lot of ways. The front-facing camera, microphones, and touchpad are all secondary on a gaming laptop, so they clearly didn't get much investment. The dual stereo speakers are also reminiscent of the "average" Windows laptop of a few years ago in that they're fine for YouTube videos or video calls, but you won't want to do much else with them. One feature a gaming laptop can't neglect is the keyboard, though, and Lenovo rarely misses here. The Legion 5i shares a keyboard with its siblings, this time with four-zone RGB lighting and a condensed tenkey number pad. It's a very solid keyboard with a comfortable and responsive action, excellent layout, full-sized arrow keys, and intelligent shortcuts and functions. I really can't complain here. As usual, there's no Windows Hello biometric authentication, but I'm not really docking the Legion 5i points for that. This is a mid-range gaming laptop, I don't expect it. I do expect excellent wireless performance, though, and the Legion 5i fares just fine on this front with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you want a more stable connection, you can always use the Ethernet port. It shouldn't surprise you if you've read this review up until this point, but the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) that we've reviewed is arguably this laptop's biggest competitor. It's not because the Legion Pro 5i is necessarily better; it's more powerful, but it's also bigger, heavier, and more expensive. It's largely because the Legion Pro 5i is more available, and unless you can find a Legion 5i configuration in stock and on sale for less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, then the Legion Pro 5i may end up the easier choice. You can also consider the Lenovo Legion Slim 5i (Gen 9). We haven't reviewed this laptop, but it's very similar in size and weight to the Legion 5i but with a tweaked design and an AMD CPU that focuses more on efficiency than raw power. This is the Legion 5 to choose if you want a pure gaming laptop that can also fare okay away from the charger for a few hours. As far as this price range is concerned, though, Lenovo's Legion line is going to be one of the more attractive options, and for good reason. ✅You want a focused, no-fuss gaming laptop on a budget The Lenovo Legion 5i is designed for one thing and one thing only: to game. Sure, it's a full-blown Windows laptop and can do all the normal PC things, too, but it's clearly built for those who aren't too concerned about that (and want to save some money on a new rig). ✅You can find it on sale for less than the Legion Pro 5i The Legion 5i should cost less than the Legion Pro 5i, but its spotty availability and odd pricing don't guarantee it. If you can find the Legion 5i in the configuration you want for a good bit less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, the Legion 5i will end up being the better laptop for most people. ❌You want a gaming laptop you can also take on the go Lenovo Legion laptops aren't known for being particularly portable or efficient, and the Legion 5i is no exception. This is a beefy laptop with a short-lived battery. Those who want a more mobile machine that can still game are better off looking at something like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus line (you'll be paying more, though). The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a bit of an odd laptop. To be frank, it would be the most obvious recommendation of Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop lineup between the Legion Slim 5i (which isn't really slim at all) and the Legion Pro 5i (which barely feels "pro"), if it weren't for it being oddly... Hard to find. • Indiana Jones for Xbox• Razer Freyja cushion• iBuyPower Slate desktop• Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Lenovo's habit of overpricing its devices at retail (only to frequently discount them soon after launch) returns here, but the Legion 5i also suffers from seemingly lower visibility and availability than the more expensive Legion Pro 5i. That laptop is just as good, and you're basically gaining more weight and size in exchange for slightly better performance and cooling, but it's also usually a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. If you can find the Lenovo Legion 5i at a discounted price that settles it below where you can find the equivalent Legion 5i Pro, I honestly suggest saving that money and getting this laptop instead. It's a gaming laptop through and through and won't win any awards outside of playing your favorite PC games, but the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a good gaming laptop at an attractive price, or around $1,120.99 at Lenovo for the configuration I'd recommend. The mid-range option in Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop family, the Legion 5i (Gen 9) goes toe-to-toe with the more expensive Legion Pro 5i more often than not, while also usually costing a fair deal less. The only problem? Lenovo and retailers are far more likely to show you the Legion Pro 5i instead.

Time Published: 2024-12-10T14:52:03Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted December 10, 2024 We’ve seen this show before… Just four short years ago, stocks and crypto were ripping to new highs at a rate that alarmed many conservative investors. Due to Covid’s warping of the space-time continuum, December 2020 feels like it was just yesterday and eons ago at the same time. In case you’ve memory-holed the second half of the year of lockdowns and Covid panic, I’ll set the stage… The weather was getting colder as winter approached in late 2020. Many areas of the country were heading back into lockdown mode as Covid cases spiked. The country had almost made it through the first year of the pandemic. But a new class of stock market speculators was starting to get anxious. Stuck at their white-collar work-from-home jobs, these young bucketeers started bidding up every crazy stock and crypto they could find. Message boards, including the now-infamous “Wall Street Bets” on Reddit, attracted mainstream attention. And social media personalities like Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy live-streamed the opening bell as they bid up random tickers, hoping to land the next 10-bagger. Of course, stock market seasonality helped fuel the flames. It was the perfect time for a year-end melt up, everyone was stuck inside, and they had cash to burn. Stocks soared and the early 2021 NFT bubble began to inflate, as well as the options-fueled squeezes in meme stocks like GME. Does any of this sound familiar? The pandemic might be over. But we’re seeing history rhyme this month as a holiday market boom rivaling 2020’s Covid bubble begins to unfold. Crypto has taken center stage early with Bitcoin pushing toward a $100K breakout extension. Alt-coins are flourishing. Heck, I even joined the ranks by grabbing some DOGE as it rallied 300% off its lows to set up for what could be an even bigger breakout “Meme stocks” might not be the biggest beneficiaries of the speculation this time around – but many forgotten stocks and sectors are catching a bid and running in the current market environment. The smaller, the better! Just look at the evolution of AI mania as the year has progressed… NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) led the artificial intelligence charge during the first six months of 2024, breaking out in early January and bolting higher by more than 175% into late June. NVDA slowed down in the summer after hogging the spotlight (and most of the gains). But the big semis started to slow down in the summer. And while NVDA and the semis have picked up the pace, they aren’t the only game in town. The risk-takers have moved down the cap scale to the smaller, more speculative artificial intelligence names. These are the stocks that are ripping higher in this environment! C3.ai (AI) has jumped nearly 65% since mid-November. BBAI has gained as much as 150% over that same timeframe. And SoundHound AI Inc. (SOUN) has exploded 190% off its early November lows. AI speculations soar into melt-up season To be clear, these stocks didn’t suddenly firm up and start to run because of any fundamental changes or a surprise news event. We’re simply seeing traders rotating into the smaller, more speculative names in the industry. I don’t know what will happen with these stocks once the music stops. That goes for these AI names — or any other small, reenergized stock that’s posting a huge rally right now. But I do know how markets work — and parabolic rallies like these rarely lead to clean, sideways consolidation. There will be downside action when the rally ebbs. Some of these stocks will reset to logical new support levels and then build bases at those prices before continuing higher. Others will retrace the entire melt-up move and slowly die on the vine. There is no other way! This doesn’t mean you have to completely avoid the melt-up darlings. But you do have to adjust your expectations… One of the biggest hurdles new traders need to clear is learning how to deal with different market environments. When you first begin to develop your unique trading strategy, you will naturally want to use it consistently to book regular gains. The problem is that consistently is often replaced with constantly. Newer traders regularly force trades in less-than-ideal environments because they can’t tear themselves away from the action. They’re chasing breakouts when breakouts aren’t working, or they’re buying stocks and sectors that are out of favor for one reason or another. It’s not that they’re taking too much risk – they’re taking the wrong kind of risk. This misunderstanding can even work against traders who, on the surface, believe they are acting conservatively. If you’re a swing trader attempting to play a small move in mega-cap semiconductor plays when the smaller AI names are working, you’re taking the wrong kind of risk. And it’s costing you! As I explained last week when I detailed my uncharacteristic meme coin trade, I’m more concerned about the trades I’m not involved with right now. In melt-up conditions, the biggest risk for traders is ignoring these impressive rallies. I routinely review my trading performance, going back over the previous six to twelve months to see how I’ve fared. During this process, I’m not very interested in counting my winners. Instead, I want to review where my losses came from, what mistakes I made, and where I can improve. Again, this process isn’t about win rates or victory laps. It’s about pinpointing where I could have made different decisions, especially as it relates to emotional blind spots I might have had at the time of the trade. Next week, I’ll dig into some of the lessons learned during my 2020 Covid trading campaign. I’ll show you how a great trade doesn’t always yield ideal results, and reveal what you can do to maximize your melt-up gains. Stay tuned…

Title: Lisa Su

Lisa Su apologizes if she seems tired. It’s the day after the U.S. presidential election, and like much of the nation she was awake until the early hours, transfixed as the results came in, only tearing herself away once it became clear that Donald Trump had won. “I wanted to know,” Su explains as she takes her place at the head of a conference table in the Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “It’s relevant information.” The identity of the next President is pertinent news to most of America’s CEOs, but few more so than the leader of a top semiconductor company. Semiconductors, or chips, are the engines of our computers, phones, cars, internet services, and—increasingly—our artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The relentless rise of the chip over the past seven decades has grown economies, transformed lives, and helped cement the U.S., where most chips get their start, as the globe’s postwar hegemon. AMD is one of the world’s leading designers of the CPU chips that power both personal computers and data centers, the vast warehouses of servers that make possible the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. It’s also a top designer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the specialized chips used to create and run AI programs like ChatGPT. When you send an email, stream a movie, buy something online, or chat with an AI assistant, chances are an AMD chip is providing some of the computing power needed to make that happen. In November, a supercomputer that runs on AMD chips displaced another AMD-based machine to become the world’s most powerful. Which is thanks in large part to Su’s leadership. When she became CEO a decade ago, AMD stock was languishing around $3, its share of the data-center chip market had fallen so far that executives rounded it down to zero, and the question on everybody’s lips was how long the company had left. An engineer by training, Su spearheaded a bottom-up redesign of AMD’s products, ­repaired ­relationships with customers, and rode the AI boom to new heights. In 2022 the company’s overall value surpassed its historical rival ­Intel’s for the first time. AMD stock now trades at around $140, a nearly 50-fold increase since Su took over. This fall, Harvard Business School began teaching Su’s stewardship of AMD as a case study. “It really is one of the great turnaround stories of modern American business history,” says Chris Miller, a historian of the semiconductor industry and the author of Chip War. Purchase prints of this issue's covers here in the TIME Cover Store and click here to buy your copy of the Person of the Year issue For all its progress, AMD remains the semiconductor industry’s distant No. 2. As Su’s team was speeding past Intel, both companies were lapped by Nvidia, run by Su’s cousin Jensen Huang, which in two years has risen from industry also-ran to become the most valuable company in the world. Nvidia got a jump on its rivals by realizing that its chips, initially made for rendering graphics, happened to be perfectly suited for training neural networks, the programs that underpin modern AI. Of the $32 billion worth of AI data-center GPUs sold in the third quarter of 2024, ­Nvidia’s accounted for some 95%. In November, AMD announced that it would lay off 4% of its global workforce in what it framed as a restructuring to focus on the opportunities from AI. Meanwhile, big tech customers, like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, are now designing their own specialized chips for AI workloads, which could reduce their reliance on AMD products. And AMD’s continued growth relies on a host of factors outside its control: continued progress in AI; the security of Taiwan, where the vast majority of its top chips are manufactured; and the actions of a notoriously unpredictable U.S. President. Trump’s return to the White House will bring new turbulence to an industry that has barely caught its breath from a half-­decade of geopolitical showdowns, shortages, and an AI-fueled market boom. A lot rides on Su’s ability to steer the company through these obstacles. People who know her describe Su as a shrewd strategist who invests in talented people and jettisons those who aren’t pulling their weight. “I don’t believe leaders are born. I believe leaders are trained,” she tells TIME, ahead of a strategy meeting where she delivers blunt feedback to her executives and urges them to move faster and delegate more. Su, 55, holds meetings on weekends and is known among her executives for wanting to talk on morning calls about the finer points of long documents that were circulated after midnight. When prototype chips get delivered from the factory, she often personally goes down to the lab to help scrutinize them. It’s a hard-­charging style that isn’t for everyone and makes it difficult for people who don’t meet their commitments to survive at the company, according to Patrick Moorhead, a tech-industry analyst and a former AMD ­executive who left before she joined. The potential for artificial intelligence to transform science, health care, and the world of work hinges on access to a diverse supply of chips. In the brewing cold war between the U.S. and China, semiconductors are among the most vital battlegrounds. And America’s economic success—as measured by its stock market, at least—depends now more than ever on the continued growth of companies that design, produce, and utilize chips. Allies say Su is up to the task. “We couldn’t have a person better qualified for this job,” says Jerry Sanders, the company’s 88-year-old founder and its first CEO. Does she have what it takes to beat Nvidia one day? “Not a question in my mind,” he says. In October 2014, Forrest Norrod was sitting in his car at a McDonald’s drive-­through when he got a phone call from Su. Norrod had just quit his job as an executive at Dell, intending to take some time off. Su wanted to pitch him on joining AMD, where she had just been appointed CEO. While Norrod waited for his Quarter Pounder with cheese, he listened to her vision for the struggling company. By the next day, he was at AMD’s Austin headquarters, weighing the opportunity to lead its server business. Norrod had seen how the pace of innovation in the cloud-­chip industry had dropped off once AMD had allowed Intel to dominate the market, and believed that customers were paying the price. He got a sense that Su was a leader with a rare combination of traits: a technical background, business acumen, and people skills. He accepted the job. Su was born in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. at age 3, when the family immigrated so her father could attend graduate school. She grew up in New York City and discovered a love of STEM subjects at an early age, growing fascinated by the ability to write rudimentary programs on her Commodore 64 computer. She fondly recalls creating, at the science-­focused high school she attended in the Bronx, a project in which she simulated a hurricane inside a box, complete with boiling water and windows through which to watch the maelstrom. She chose to major in electrical engineering at MIT after determining that it was the most difficult option—and eventually earned her Ph.D. in the subject. It was at MIT that Su first experienced a semiconductor lab, where she was taken by the idea that such a tiny piece of hardware could carry so much mathematical firepower. She spent the first years of her career at Texas Instruments and IBM, two first-wave tech titans, which taught her about how to run a business and manage teams. “I was really lucky early in my career,” she says. “Every two years, I did a different thing.” She accepted a VP job at AMD in 2012, and by 2014 had ­ascended to CEO. “I felt like I was in training for the opportunity to do something meaningful in the semiconductor industry,” she says. “And AMD was my shot.” Su took over an indebted firm that had fired 25% of its staff, sold and leased back its Austin office, and spun off its expensive chip factories. It was a moment of change for the tech industry writ large. Smartphones and tablets were ascendant. Consumer PCs, AMD’s main market, were in decline. “It didn’t look at the time that Lisa was ­really set up for success,” says Stacy Rasgon, a chip-­industry analyst. “She was handed a tough situation.” Su’s turnaround plan had three steps: build great products, focus on customer relationships, and simplify the business. Some AMD board members wanted to pivot toward making low-power processors for phones. Su rejected that approach. “We needed to bet on what we were good at,” she says. What AMD was good at was building ­powerful processors. Su set a goal for her engineers: to build a new CPU chip that was 40% faster than the previous generation’s. And she started a team on an even more ambitious project: to explore how to develop a chip for the world’s first exascale super­computer, a machine capable of carrying out 1 quintillion operations per second. The decisions revealed a core tenet of Su’s leadership philosophy. “People are really motivated by ambitious goals,” she says. “The previous strategy of, hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there—that’s actually less motivational.” The problem was that Su’s plans would take years to come to fruition. In the meantime, AMD was still on the ropes. “My job as a CEO was to give the engineers time to do the work,” Su says. She inked deals with console manufacturers that won AMD the revenue it needed to keep afloat. In 2016, she signed another with a consortium of ­Chinese companies, licensing some of AMD’s ­designs so they could make processors for the Chinese market. That deal brought in $293 million, though it would later come back to haunt AMD. By 2017, the company was on stronger financial footing and the new flagship chip was finally ready. Engineers had redesigned the CPU from the ground up, making use of a new architecture, which the company called “chiplets.” Until then, the chip industry had mainly etched the different parts of a processor onto one piece of silicon. AMD’s innovation was to put different circuits onto individual pieces of silicon and then fuse them all together, which made manufacturing more reliable and scalable. Engineers suggested to Su that they call the new chip “Zen,” because it was designed with a balance in mind between energy efficiency and high performance. The name stuck. Meanwhile, Intel, AMD’s main competitor, was beginning to flounder. Its new cloud processors were beset by delays. When AMD’s chips hit the market, they were the best on the block. With each new generation of Zen, AMD’s share of the cloud-­CPU market grew. Today, its share of that market is 34%. When AMD’s overall valuation surpassed Intel’s in 2022, “it felt fantastic,” Norrod says. “It’s something that I don’t think anybody in the industry would have believed was possible just a few years ago.” One recent afternoon at AMD’s Santa Clara headquarters, Su was sitting with several senior executives in the CEO’s favorite corner conference room, where the offices of both Nvidia and Intel are visible through the glass. In the meeting, Su pressed her colleagues to meet engineering milestones for the specialized chips that AMD sells for use in AI data centers. “We cannot miss a beat,” Su told them. “We have negative slack. Whatever we do organizationally, we cannot slow down.” AMD is grappling with geopolitical challenges that could reshape the semiconductor industry. Today’s chips have billions of transistors, tiny gates for managing electric current. To manufacture them requires colossal machines with hundreds of thousands of specialized parts, which fire lasers at tiny droplets of molten tin to create extreme ultra­violet light that bounces through a series of multilayered mirrors and, ultimately, etches designs onto thin wafers of silicon with atomic-level accuracy. A stray particle in the machine, a half-degree fluctuation in temperature, or a nanometer-­scale vibration could each threaten a batch of chips worth millions of dollars. The process is so complex, fragile, and expensive that only one company is currently able to manufacture at scale the most cutting-edge chips designed by the likes of AMD and Nvidia: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The industry’s most advanced chips may be conceived in Silicon Valley, but their fabrication is almost entirely outsourced to just a handful of factories on the west coast of Taiwan. Some 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait lies China, which claims the self-­governing island as its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, according to U.S. intelligence assessments made public last year. And Xi has set China on a path to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. by producing powerful chips of its own. Without Taiwanese manufacturing, the semiconductor industry would be upended and the world’s supply of advanced chips would plummet. And if Beijing's effort to become a world-leading semiconductor producer is successful, it would set up China's military and AI industry to match or outpace America’s, which many in Washington view as a national-­security threat. In this light, Su’s 2016 decision to go into business with Chinese state-backed companies looks like a misstep. Pentagon officials tried and failed to block the deal at the time, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited worries that AMD had transferred crucial know-how that could aid China’s military and domestic semiconductor ambitions. AMD denied suggestions that it had sought to evade regulatory scrutiny on the deal, saying that it had correctly briefed the Pentagon and other agencies and had received no objections, and that the Journal’s story contained “several factual errors and omissions.” At the time, there were few laws against technology transfer to China, and deeper economic integration between the two powers was viewed by many as natural. “It was a very different era,” Su says. But the music would quickly change. In 2019, the Trump Administration placed AMD’s Chinese joint venture on the “entity list” that restricts exports of critical ­technologies to foreign ­adversaries because of perceived ­security risks. In 2022, the Biden Administration passed broader export controls that made it illegal for companies like AMD and Nvidia to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese companies. Demand for specialized AI chips is so high, and their supply so constrained, that these export controls have so far had little effect on chipmakers’ bottom lines. But Trump is expected to further expand tariffs and sanctions on China, which could quickly become painful for chip companies. Some 15% of AMD’s revenue in 2023—$3.4 billion—came from the legal sale of less powerful chips to China and Hong Kong. AMD warned investors in October that its business could be adversely affected by tariffs, as well as any retaliatory measures imposed by foreign governments. If it’s any consolation for AMD’s market position, its rivals are even more exposed: in 2023, China and Hong Kong accounted for 17% of Nvidia’s revenue, and China represented 27% of Intel’s. “We want to service the entire world with our chips,” Su says. “[But] I’m certainly a believer in: we want to be the most advanced semiconductor country.” Still, AMD is incentivized to lobby against the widening of chip export controls, even if officials determine that more sanctions would be in the interests of national security. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group of U.S. chip companies including AMD, argues against export controls, and has spent more than $4.5 million since 2022 lobbying lawmakers in Washington, according to the watchdog OpenSecrets. “You have to run faster,” Su says of her view of the U.S.’s competition with China. She says her main goal with any lobbying is to help lawmakers make sure “that any desired policy has the desired effect,” adding, “We certainly want to be a good corporate citizen.” Inside a high-security laboratory beyond the dry hills at Silicon Valley’s ­eastern edge, a team of government scientists celebrated a major milestone in November. The machine under their care, housed in a room longer than a football field, had just achieved the official title of most powerful supercomputer in the world. If every single person on earth were to make one calculation per second, it would take them over 480 years to calculate what this supercomputer could in one minute. The machine is called El Capitan, after the massive granite rock formation in Yosemite National Park. At its heart are more than 44,000 AMD chips called accelerated processing units (APUs), which combine elements of CPUs and GPUs in the same chip. When Su heard the news that El Capitan had officially become the most powerful supercomputer in the world, she was ecstatic. “These are the days I live for,” she says. The achievement meant that the two most powerful supercomputers in the world are now powered by AMD chips. For Su, the win was about more than just bragging rights. “I personally visited the labs several times,” she says. Fulfilling her pledge to create best-in-class technology became almost an obsession, just as delivering Zen chips on time to waiting customers had been years earlier. “She’s so, so customer-centric,” says Vamsi Boppana, AMD’s senior vice president for AI. “She absolutely wants to delight, and that has served the company so well.” Su views supercomputing as the wellspring from which further AI profits will flow. The chips in El Capitan are “without a doubt, the most complex thing we’ve ever built,” she says. But they were not a single-purpose ­investment. The designs that AMD engineers used for El Capitan are already trickling down into the specialized AI chips supplied to clients like Meta and Micro­soft. The most advanced AMD chip currently on sale in the AI market, called the Instinct MI300X, is the “first cousin” of the chips inside El Capitan, says Mark ­Papermaster, AMD’s chief technology officer. That’s thanks to their chiplet-based designs, which make it relatively simple to switch in and out different components. “There is so much synergy between traditional high-­performance supercomputing and AI,” Su says. AMD always had a business in building GPUs for gaming, but after the release of ­ChatGPT in 2022, the company quickly spun up a more powerful line aimed at the data-center market. And in the past year, AMD’s projected revenue from specialized AI chip sales has leaped from essentially $0 to $5 billion, which would account for roughly 5% of that market. (Nvidia maintains a hammerlock on most of the rest.) This line of chips is now a popular choice for what’s known in the industry as AI “inference,” or the running of an already-formed AI system. For years, the easiest way to increase AI performance was by simply training bigger models on more GPU chips. But as some computer scientists report diminishing returns from that practice, companies are now turning to a different strategy: increasing the time AIs spend running ­instead—in the inference phase, rather than the training phase. That could be good news for AMD, whose inference chips are approaching parity with Nvidia’s in terms of not only speed but also energy efficiency, which matters even more when you’re running an AI over a longer period. “We do see inference as a growing piece of the market,” says Boppana. AMD is still struggling to break into the training phase of the market. That’s largely because Nvidia controls the world’s leading software for optimizing GPUs for that ­purpose—and it only works with Nvidia chips. The huge number of developers who already use it gives Nvidia an ongoing advantage. AMD is building its own competing software, but it is “absolutely behind Nvidia’s,” says Moorhead, the former AMD executive. Su says AMD is catching up. That’s partly thanks to an informal alliance with tech companies, including Meta, that want to avoid handing Nvidia an outright monopoly. Meta is buying AMD chips, contributing to AMD’s code base, and using its software in its data centers. “It’s a very good symbiotic relationship,” says Moorhead. “Without AMD, Nvidia can double their prices.” Says Su: “Nobody wants to be locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Really our strategy is: let’s invest in an open ecosystem. And then may the best chip win.” Yet in their bid to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, major AI companies have also begun to design some of their own chips in-house. That could threaten AMD in the long term. But Su doesn’t see it that way. “I actually see it as an opportunity,” she says. No company wants to replicate the $6 billion AMD pours into R&D annually, she argues. She sees instead a future where big tech companies continue to spend on AMD’s chips, while also relying on their own chips for certain workloads. “There’s no one-size-fits-all in computing,” she says. “The broader the ecosystem, the bigger the party.” If Su is right, the size of the party is going to keep on growing. She predicts the specialized AI chip market alone will grow to be worth $500 billion by 2028—more than the size of the entire semiconductor industry a decade ago. To be the No. 2 company in that market would still make AMD a behemoth. Sure, AMD won’t be overtaking Nvidia anytime soon. But Su measures her plans in decades. “When you invest in a new area, it is a five- to 10-year arc to really build out all of the various pieces,” she says. “The thing about our business is, everything takes time.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: What will the year 2025 bring for Linux PCs?
URL: https://www.pcworld.com/article/2545251/what-will-the-year-2025-bring-for-linux.html

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%. GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an "underperform" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday. Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations. European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, a signal that demand for AI-focused chips remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. The company reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion), down 12% from October's figures, while revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) turned more bullish on some bitcoin (BTC) mining stocks in its coverage following third quarter results and recent gains in bitcoin price and the network hashrate, the bank said in a report on Tuesday. The bank upgraded Cipher Mining (CIFR) and CleanSpark (CLSK) to overweight from neutral. JPMorgan also introduced a new price $8 price target for Cipher, and raised its CleanSpark price target to $17 from $10.50. MARA Holdings (MARA) was also upgraded to neutral from underweight and raised its price target on the stock to $23 from $12. The U.S. bank downgraded IREN (IREN) to neutral from overweight while increasing its price target on the shares to $15 from $9.50. It raised its Riot Platforms (RIOT) price target to $16 from $9.50, while maintaining its overweight rating on the company. The bank said it was introducing a new sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation framework for the miners, which took into account company's mining operations, their respective land and power portfolios, and their hodl balance to reflect any bitcoin that the firms may hold on their balance sheet. Cipher rose over 4% in early trading Tuesday, CleanSpark gained around 3.5%, MARA climbed over 2%, RIOT was almost 2% higher, and IREN was 0.4% better.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Banks Favor King Dollar as BTC Tug-of-War Rages

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's bull-bear tug-of-war continues to rage, with prices recovering to over $97,000 from Monday's dip to $94,200. The slide was prompted by concern Google's new quantum-computing chip, Willow, could compromise BTC's security — a worry quickly dismissed by analysts. That leaves directional traders with little to do other than wait for the dust to settle before picking a side, as prices remain locked in Thursday's indecisive trading range. But there’s a silver lining! The turbulence has crowded out those undisciplined, overleveraged altcoin traders, as is evident from perpetual funding rates. Altcoin rates have receded closer to the center of Velo Data's heat map, which oscillates between -200% and 200%, indicating more balanced conditions than the bullish extremes of last week. Tokens like Stacks' STX even sport negative funding rates, a perfect entry point for bulls, according to pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General. "If these rates continue to decline, it could signal the unwinding of excessive long leverage, potentially leading to a more balanced market," analysts at Bitfinex said, adding that $100,000 is no longer the key support/resistance level and a new equilibrium is probably forming in spot markets. That said, as we look toward the end of 2024, there’s a developing story: Banks are getting bullish on the dollar, which doesn’t usually bode well for assets denominated in the U.S. currency, like BTC and risk assets. "The combination of cyclical, fiscal, and U.S. political forces is making the USD stronger again," HSBC said recently. "We update our USD bullish view further; the USD bubble is re-inflating, which spells trouble ahead for many other currencies." Citibank sees the dollar index (DXY) rallying to 115, an 8% increase. Keep an eye on the Far East too. A renewed rally in Chinese stocks following Beijing's promise of more stimulus could suck capital from other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid all this, there's talk President-elect Trump may struggle to deliver his crypto promises. Peter Tschir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, put it best: "Trump does have loyalty to those who helped fund his campaign, but I don't see this as a lasting relationship, especially as he will likely get a lot of pressure from the National Security element of D.C. to be cautious on helping crypto too much." After all, it's one thing to promise big from Mar-a-Lago and a different ball game when delivering from the White House. Stay Alert! By Shaurya MalwaEverything with "quantum" in the name is pumping! Various tokens themed after, or claiming to use, quantum computing within their technology stack jumped more than 100% in the past 24 hours after internet giant Google unveiled Willow, a quantum-computing chip that took 5 minutes to solve tasks during its testing period that would have taken 10 septillion years for current supercomputers to finish. Crypto markets took a hit after the announcement on concerns the development was long-term bearish for bitcoin and other blockchains, whose security features can, in theory, be exploited by quantum computers.But while the entire market dropped, tokens such as Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Quantum Network, Quantum Swap, among others, zoomed higher.Quantum-resistant or post-quantum tokens aim to use cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against quantum computing attacks. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks using Shor’s algorithm, which is particularly effective against current public-key cryptosystems. Tokens labeled with "quantum" might be perceived as being at the forefront of technology, even if their actual utility or relation to quantum computing is minimal. This perception can drive investment — and a chance to speculate on the short-term trading narrative.

Time Published: 2024-12-10T11:55:00Z
Full Content:
December 10, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the following ETF: YieldMax™ MARA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: MARO) MARO seeks to generate current income by pursuing options-based strategies on MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA). MARO is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. MARO does not invest directly in MARA. MARO is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, MARO will be a Group B ETF and its first distribution is expected to be announced on January 2, 2025. Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: CRSH, FIAT, DIPS and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. Distributions are not guaranteed. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Prospectuses Click here. Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Best Places to Work in IT 2025

What makes a company a great place to work for IT professionals? Top salaries and benefits certainly help, but those are just table stakes. Tech workers are looking for challenging projects, growth opportunities, and continuous learning in a supportive workplace. For the 31st year, Computerworld publisher Foundry surveyed large, midsize, and small organizations to find the top IT employers. Read our special report to see which companies made our list and what makes them such desirable places to work. To read the Best Places to Work in IT 2025 report in PDF format, download it below (no registration required). The ongoing quest for technical talent in an uncertain economic environment has caused many organizations to turn their attention inward, taking steps to keep their existing IT workforce engaged and invested in the overall business charter. The goal: build a collaborative IT culture defined by continuous learning, meaningful work, and positive contributions to the business. Companies participating in Computerworld’s 31st annual “Best Places to Work in IT” survey show a strong commitment to in-house IT talent, even as they cast a wider net for IT candidates to build a more diverse workforce that fosters creativity and innovation. A heightened emphasis on training is designed to enrich technical skills — especially in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and the cloud — as well as soft skill sets that align with broader business objectives. “We are steadfast in our technology investments and continue to modernize our skill sets, technologies, and processes at the same speed as ever — or even faster,” says Deepa Soni, chief information and operations officer at The Hartford, ranked No. 2 overall and No. 4 in the career development/training category among large companies in this year’s survey. “We think about three things to make IT the best destination for internal and external folks: Leveraging cutting-edge technology and solutions, creating business impact, and building a culture that fosters creativity while being inclusive and diverse.” Our survey found that the relentless pace of new hiring over the past two years remains robust. Among the surveyed companies, 79% have increased the total number of IT employees over the last three years, on average by 36%. This is down from a high of 86% in the 2024 survey but surpasses the 72% of companies reporting three-year IT workforce gains in 2023. But although IT hiring is picking up steam again after a brief lull, survey respondents indicated that another cooling-off period may lie ahead. Just half of this year’s respondents plan to increase the number of IT hires over the next fiscal year, down significantly from the previous two years (71% and 72%, respectively). Nearly half of the organizations (46%) expect the size of their IT workforce to remain the same, with larger firms more likely to face hiring slowdowns. Conversely, 70% of smaller companies plan to add IT talent, with an average increase of 10%. VyStar Credit Union, ranked third overall among midsize company respondents, is being very intentional about its IT hiring strategy while it moves to fill key openings. The plan is to slowly augment its 271-person IT staff with several critical positions, including a high-level AI thought leader and champion, several data architects, and engineers versed in software development life cycle skills such as DevOps automation. “We are focused on how to make the best use of AI for our organization and are on a relentless journey to automate and streamline processes,” says Lisa Cochran, CIO of VyStar. “We are a heavily regulated organization, so we must have consistent ways of documenting changes. If we can capture and create artifacts without a human, then developers can spend less time on documentation.” Like VyStar, many other companies are mapping the smaller number of external hires to highly coveted emerging skills categories — many of which are in short supply in the general marketplace. Among this year’s respondents, most new open IT-related positions fall into critical skills groups such as AI/machine learning (86%), data science/analytics (78%), cloud/multicloud (76%), and IT/cybersecurity (67%). In each of these competency areas, companies have dialed up hiring over last year’s, most significantly in the AI/machine learning (ML) area, which saw a 12-point year-over-year hike. To address the need for more traditional IT skills, companies are relying more heavily on contract workers. In this year’s survey, the number of temporary or contract workers increased 10% on average across all respondents, compared with an average 7% decrease in contract workers hired over the prior 12 months. While casting an eye toward external talent, organizations continue to promote from within to hold onto existing talent. This year’s survey found that 13% of IT employees across all companies advanced to new positions in the last fiscal year, much as in the last two years (15% in the 2024 survey and 14% in 2023). Similarly, salary bumps remain in line with last year’s findings, with 90% of IT employees the beneficiaries of a raise. Salary cuts or wage freezes don’t appear to be on the table — the vast majority (96%) of this year’s respondents said no such plans were in the works, now or in the foreseeable future. This year’s survey indicates that IT professionals have plenty of opportunities to take advantage of internal programs to boost their career. Respondent companies are upleveling training programs with new curriculum that burnishes both technical and business skills, going deeper on high-demand technologies such as AI and cloud engineering while also providing education on soft skills such as change management and communications, to accommodate the increasing influence of digital technologies across the business. As part of the emphasis on internal employee development, companies are putting structures in place to help IT professionals actively chart a career course. New mentorship, apprenticeship, and job rotation programs deliver exposure to emerging technology domains as well as full immersion in the business. Defined learning paths and formalized skills assessments help IT workers be more intentional about identifying and addressing critical skills gaps when mapping out their next career move. These efforts continue to move the needle on internal mobility: Approximately 35% of IT vacancies are now being filled through company insiders, equal to last year’s percentage and down slightly from the 38% reported in the 2023 survey. At Amerisure Mutual Insurance, which ranked fourth overall among small companies and sixth for career development and training, communities of practice meet monthly or quarterly, providing cross-functional IT groups and business professionals with demonstrations, tutorials, and training to build expertise in areas such as agile, DevOps, and product architecture. In addition, all IT staffers now participate in a proprietary skills assessment that spells out current skills and targets key areas for improvement. “Development plans can be too broad and not actionable,” notes Amjed Al-Zoubi, Amerisure’s CIO. “This isn’t a checklist but, rather, a very clear conversation and development plan highlighting the skills they need to grow into specific jobs.” Amerisure also bolsters internal IT development practices by increasing the emphasis on business outcomes. Historically, Amerisure assigned people to projects from a central IT talent pool, reassigning them when work was complete. Today, IT teams are aligned with eight different business groups. “There were inefficiencies in our old process, and IT was limited in their ability to learn the business,” Al-Zoubi explains. “Now the IT underwriting team is aligned with the business underwriting team, and they work together to solve underwriting problems. We bring our best, and they bring their best, and it results in higher-performing teams.” Training courses offered by survey respondents run the gamut and are available to all IT employees, regardless of where they work. Technical training, technical certifications, and management training are the most prevalent forms of instruction, but there is also a heavy emphasis on professional career development, building business and soft skills, and even health and wellness. The Hartford is continuing to uplevel its skills development programs to stay abreast of the latest technology trends and leadership skills. For example, the firm has doubled training hours available for cloud, agile development, data science, and cybersecurity. The company’s HartCode Academy Bootcamp provides an avenue for non-IT people to learn software engineering and business data analysis skills, and there are numerous executive-level programs devoted to cultivating leadership skills. “We are helping IT leaders get really comfortable with change and how they lead teams,” Soni says. “We are training folks to be the CIOs of the future.” Given the emphasis on continuous learning, training budgets remain flush, with 39% of this year’s respondents increasing their training budget from the previous year and 59% reporting no change to their allocations. The number of companies increasing their training budget has fallen over the past two years, down from 62% in 2023 and 49% last year. Most companies don’t set caps on training: 77% give employees the latitude to participate in as many programs as they desire. Those that do restrict employees limit them to seven days, on average, of in-person or remote training annually. To spark engagement, companies are courting employees with a variety of tactics, including hosting employee appreciation events (98%), doling out bonuses or other high-value items to reward high performers (92%), and building clear career paths with attainable milestones (88%). Free career development services are also offered by 82% of the respondents. Mentoring programs remain a consistent and widely prevalent vehicle for upskilling existing IT workers, offered by 76% of the responding companies, which is similar to last year. Companies continue to dedicate time and money to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, confident that greater workforce diversity is an important element of company culture as well as a factor in upleveling innovation and diversity of thought. Overall DEI efforts have made an impact, but they’ve been slower to reshape the makeup of the traditional IT workforce, particularly when it comes to women, who made up 27% of the IT workforce among respondents this year, down slightly from 29% in 2024 and 28% in 2023. On the other hand, minority hires are on the rise. Among this year’s respondents, the number of people in IT identifying as part of a minority group jumped to 36%, compared to 33% in the 2024 survey. Minority groups accounted for 29% of the IT managers and 37% of the nonmanagers. The percentage of companies with a formal DEI strategy fell this year to 88%, down six points from 2024. Large firms were more likely to have a formal strategy, at 94%. Companies were also less likely to have a dedicated role in place to promote DEI (54% this year, compared to 62% in 2024), although most respondents (92%) maintain either a person or a team in place to champion DEI policies and awareness. The Hartford has been steadfast in its commitment to diversity, to the point where DEI is infused into company culture instead of serving as a stand-alone program, says Soni. “DEI is baked into the fabric of how we do business quite uniquely,” she says. “We view it as a business necessity — we have to represent the society that we live in in the workplaces we have.” To encourage greater understanding of DEI and its potential impacts, organizations such as The Hartford are serving up a smorgasbord of DEI training, including curriculum focused on preventing discrimination and harassment (96%) and creating an inclusive workspace (92%). Much of the DEI activity is consistent with last year’s survey, with one notable exception: providing targeted internships for women and minorities, at 50% this year, compared to 60% in the 2024 survey. The most popular steps for promoting DEI include celebration of employee differences (96%), recruitment strategies aimed at attracting diverse employees (94%), and diversity and inclusion training (93%). Creating corporate enterprise resource groups (ERGs) based on common goals, interests, and identity affiliations is another way organizations are fostering and empowering like-minded communities. Respondents are forming ERGs to support women, people of color, and LGBTQ populations as well as those aimed at niche areas such as caregivers, veterans, and even video gamers. One of The Hartford’s unique DEI efforts is its reverse mentoring program, where an employee with a diverse background is paired with a senior executive to help that person learn what it’s like to work in the firm as a diverse hire. “It’s about putting our executives in their shoes,” Soni says. The program, which started as an experiment, has been well received by executives as well as mentees, she says. Organizations are shoring up DEI efforts in part through leader accountability. Among the respondents, 33% evaluate IT leaders based on their progress on meeting specific DEI goals, up slightly from last year, 31%. At the same time, DEI progress and outcomes are having an impact on IT leader compensation: 22% this year, compared to 19% in 2024. OCLC, ranked second overall for midsize companies and first in the DEI category, has deployed many of these initiatives and is enjoying success in cultivating a more diverse IT workforce. The company, a nonprofit organization providing technology and services to the library community, has expanded recruiting efforts into diverse talent pools, including technology boot camps aimed at underrepresented communities, while forging partnerships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Another lever for change: creating new job classes that remove the requirement for a four-year technical degree in tandem with instituting a local outreach coding program. “This produces staff with some level of familiarity with development, but not a degree,” says Bart Murphy, chief technology and information officer of OCLC. “We do a checkpoint every month to ensure the staffer is progressing and getting what they need to move up into an engineering role here or another organization. It’s helped build a diverse pipeline.” The DEI efforts are having an impact. OCLC has shown steady increases in BIPOC and female representation for the last 15 years. Currently the IT department boasts 29.5% female representation, better than the industry average, Murphy says. Well past the height of the pandemic, hybrid work models continue to be the norm, including in IT departments. Much like last year, most respondents (92%) to this year’s survey have established a formal policy on flexible work, although there is no one-size-fits-all model. The breakdown of employee work patterns has remained consistent with last year’s: On average, 13% of IT employees are reporting to the office on a daily basis; 31% are fully remote; and 56% work in some sort of hybrid model, splitting time in and out of the office. Most companies (71%) give employees a moderate level of autonomy to choose where they work, but often the arrangement needs to be approved by the company or meet certain parameters. That’s a notable change from last year, when 62% enjoyed moderate levels of autonomy and 35% could choose where they wanted to work on any given day. Midsize companies are more likely to leave the decision of where to work to employees, at 34%. Companies now have well-established policies to ensure hybrid work success, including provisioning a full slate of technology equipment, formalizing use of collaboration platforms, and training employees and managers on tools and communications best practices. VyStar’s flexible work program lets employees choose the days they work in-office or remotely. Individuals select eight days a month to be in the office, and managers and leaders choose 12 days. All employees can work remotely in July, a perk the company touts as creating better flexibility and work/life balance. “Remote July was created for people who want their kids to visit with grandparents or to see another country,” Cochran says, adding that once a request is made, the IT department provisions the proper secure technology to support the arrangements. “It’s a great benefit, and we get a lot of positive feedback.” Whether they’re recruiting new talent or developing the skills of their in-house teams, the leaders in this year’s “Best Places to Work in IT” study offer a variety of benefits to promote satisfaction and loyalty among the IT workforce. Programs range from comprehensive wellness plans and spot bonuses to financial wellness coaching and even pet insurance. Perhaps the most consequential factor influencing how IT professionals feel about their job is carving out opportunities for meaningful work and continuous professional development. At Tokio Marine North America Services, ranked second overall among small companies and first in both career development/training and DEI, this mindset translates into a culture that emphasizes leading-edge technologies in the context of driving business goals while providing individual advancement opportunities along the way. “Flexible work arrangements and fair compensation make it easier to get people in the door,” says Bob Pick, the company’s executive vice president and CIO. “To keep them here, we train the daylights out of everyone and ensure diagonal and horizontal career mobility. We retain great institutional knowledge, and people get a new career path. It’s a win-win.”— Beth Stackpole See the top workplaces for tech pros at large, midsize, and small organizations. 5,000 or more employees 1,001–4,999 employees 1,000 or fewer employees Computerworld publisher Foundry conducted its 31st annual survey to identify the best places for IT professionals to work. In April 2024, Computerworld started accepting nominations from organizations that had a minimum of 100 total employees and five IT employees. Participants were asked to provide contact information for a person at their organization who is familiar with or has access to employment statistics and financial data as well as benefits policies and programs for the IT department and the entire organization. Beginning in mid-April 2024, contacts at the nominated organizations received a 58-question company survey across six categories: In addition to receiving scores based on answers to closed-ended questions, the survey entries (including numerous open-ended responses) were reviewed and evaluated by a panel of industry experts. The nomination and company surveys were conducted online. Responses to the company survey were collected and tabulated by a third-party research vendor. The research was closed in July 2024. Our top 10 lists show the best of the best — the organizations that excel in each of the six categories covered. To determine each list, we considered the following factors: For scoring the responses from the company surveys, results were weighted against averages and benchmarks calculated within each company size group.

Title: AI regulation will slow innovation to speed it up, DataStax CEO says

As artificial intelligence continues to barrel forward with increasingly capable models and applications, DataStax chief executive Chet Kapoor thinks governments will be more involved in the rollout of the technology — and that won’t necessarily be a bad thing. While Kapoor said he’s generally not in favor of government intervention because it risks stifling innovation, he’s all for it when it comes to AI. “Governments will have to be a little bit more involved,” the CEO said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video interview series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite (NDAQ). “We will need to think about governance from a country perspective, from an industry perspective, from a company perspective.” “In doing all of that, we may slow down things a little bit,” said Kapoor, whose company is a data platform providing stacks used by enterprises to build generative AI applications. “But we’ll be slowing it down to speed it up.” AI raises a number of red flags that regulators around the world will be forced to contend with, including data privacy, cybersecurity, and algorithmic biases. Although there are no federal rules explicitly aimed at AI in the U.S., the Biden administration has released an executive order on the safe use and development of AI, as well as a blueprint for a so-called “AI Bill of Rights.” Both documents aim to mitigate some of the risks associated with AI and lay the groundwork for further legislation. But President-elect Donald Trump has taken an deregulatory stance on most industries, particularly the financial services and housing sectors. When it comes to AI, he reportedly plans to repeal the Biden-era executive order and could instruct federal agencies to take a more hands-off approach to AI. Given that any number of guardrails could slow the progress on AI, albeit temporarily, Kapoor isn’t worried about AI outpacing what his company can provide. He’s excited about the opportunities AI is creating for companies — both AI native and non-native alike — to bolster their technological capabilities. “The AI natives get AI intuitively, they’re building their companies, their apps and things like that on it. They know exactly how to bring the different pieces together,” Kapoor said. “And I’m not talking about OpenAI and Google (GOOGL), I’m talking about the people starting companies in garages and the new Salesforces.” “The real fun, the real opportunity is not just those companies,” he added. “The real opportunity is how do you make sure that 30 million developers who are developing technology all over the world can actually use tools to build gen AI apps?” In October, DataStax announced its DataStax AI Platform, built using Nvidia (NVDA) AI. The platform, which integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise software, reduces AI development time by 60%, the company said. Kapoor said DataStax’s partnership with Nvidia has allowed the company to offer a tool that helps make developers more agile, and makes developing genAI apps more cost effective and scalable. “At the end of the day, we care about two things. Just two things,” he said. “We care about building products that developers love, that change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for. Nvidia helps us with both.” Watch the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor above. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Given its better valuation, we believe that Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) is currently a better pick over its peer, Oracle stock. CRM stock trades at 9.5x trailing revenues, versus 9.8x for ORCL. Although Oracle is more profitable, Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think CRM will outperform ORCL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. ORCL stock has seen strong gains of 225% from levels of $60 in early January 2021 to around $195 now, vs. an increase of about 65% for CRM stock from $220 to $360. This compares with roughly 60% gains for the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Admirably, ORCL stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 85% so far in 2024. CRM stock hasn’t been that consistent, with returns of 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 38% this year – indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including META, COMM, and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Salesforce has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 18.1% from $21.3 billion in 2021 to $34.9 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in January). On the other hand, Oracle’s average revenue growth rate of 9.5% from $40.5 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in May) over this period has been comparatively slower. Salesforce’s revenue growth lately has been driven by an increase in subscription and support sales, amid increased demand for its cloud-based offerings, including – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. Salesforce aims to grow its revenues by leveraging the technological revolution that includes the demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company is benefiting from its AI system – Agentforce. The company continues to introduce AI capabilities across its offerings, which is resulting in increased adoption. Oracle’s revenue growth is also being driven by increased consumption of its cloud offerings. Oracle is benefiting from its success with generative AI workloads. In fact, it expects its revenue to double in five years, as more on-site database customers move to the cloud. As an aside, check out Sell LULU Stock, Buy eBay? Looking forward, both Salesforce and Oracle are expected to benefit from the rising demand for cloud and AI. Oracle is investing in AI infrastructure and has partnered with key players, including AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect both companies to see their sales rise at a low double-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. Looking at profitability, Oracle’s adjusted net income margin has declined from 34.9% in 2021 to 29.7% in 2024, while that for Salesforce has risen from 21.6% to 23.2% over this period. Now, Oracle’s 30.3% adjusted net income margin for the last twelve-month period fares much better than 25.5% for Salesforce. From a financial risk perspective, Salesforce seems to have an edge over Oracle. Its 3% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 16% for Oracle, while its 14% cash a percentage of assets is higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that Salesforce has a better debt position and more cash cushion. We see that Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. On the other hand, Oracle is more profitable. Now, looking at prospects, we believe CRM is the better choice of the two. At its current levels of $360, CRM stock is trading at 37x its trailing adjusted earnings of $9.70 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 43x over the last four years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $190, ORCL stock trades at 32x its trailing adjusted earnings of $5.77 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. We think that an upward revision in valuation multiple for both stocks is warranted, given the rising AI-based cloud demand. ORCL stock, trading at a valuation multiple much higher than its historical average, while CRM stock trading at a multiple lower than historical average, doesn’t make sense in our view. We think this gap will narrow in favor of CRM. While both stocks may offer robust gains in the long term, if one has to pick, we believe CRM is a better choice. While CRM may outperform ORCL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Salesforce’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

(Bloomberg) -- Baillie Gifford & Co., known for investing in hyper-growth tech stocks, now likes “boring” US infrastructure companies as it sees a building boom after many years of under-investment. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Ambitions NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit “We think there’s going to be a massive building boom certainly in the US, the UK and in some other places,” Stuart Dunbar, a partner at the Edinburgh-based firm, told Bloomberg in Tokyo. Baillie Gifford still likes some US big tech stocks but is underweight on many of them now because of high valuations, he said. “In parts of Europe and in the US, the infrastructure is just falling apart. It’s been under-invested for 50 years and it’s getting to the point where it can’t be ignored any longer, with bridges falling down literally,” Dunbar said. “It’s quite an unexpected source of growth, like building aggregates suppliers, drainage systems providers,” he said, mentioning companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and Stella-Jones Inc. as among its favorites. Baillie Gifford has been known for its big bets in large tech firms such as Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But it’s now underweight most such US stocks — an unusual stance for the firm — despite its positive long-term view on them, Dunbar said. Investment in suppliers of water pipes and utility poles is by no means a departure from its growth stock strategy, though. “We will look wherever we need to look to try to find the companies that we think have got the ability not only to grow quickly, but to do so profitably,” Dunbar said. For tech stocks, Nvidia Corp.’s high valuation depends on continued growth, according to the investment manager. Nvidia, which makes chips used for AI data centers, trades at 34 times expected earnings, well above 23 times for the S&P 500 index. “That growth isn’t likely sustainable in the long term unless we start to see meaningful value coming through from applications of AI, so we’ve been top-slicing it,” Dunbar said, adding that Baillie Gifford still holds Nvidia and doesn’t have a negative view. Baillie Gifford is more cautious on Google parent Alphabet Inc., fretting that “AI could be a Google killer,” Dunbar said. On the other hand, it’s still a fan of Amazon because strong research and development spending allows it keep a solid competitive position. Meta also has a strong data set on which the firm can build AI capabilities, while Tesla has “incredible robotics and energy businesses” even though its rival BYD Co. “makes better cars at half the price,” he added. BYD is among China tech shares that Baillie Gifford sees coming back, despite headwinds from threats of tariffs from the US, and Europe in the case of EV makers. Elsewhere, the investment manager thinks digital banking is an important trend, betting on fintech firms such as Nu Holdings Ltd. in Brazil and Adyen NV in the Netherlands.

Title: Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG could usher in a new, inevitable M&A wave

Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 That’s one hell of a way for the agency holding companies to end the year. Just as everyone was looking to slow down and take a holiday-induced break before what will be a turbulent 2025, along comes Omnicom with a proposed stock-driven acquisition of Interpublic Group. The two CEOs — Omnicom’s John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky — shared on their conference call Monday morning to announce the deal that they have been discussing this combination for the better part of a year. Suffice it to say that, should the deal clear regulatory and shareholder approvals — (those CEOs are hoping it will clear in the second half of 2025) — the combined $30 billion revenue will give the industry the equivalent of a megalodon shark in a sea of great whites and hammerheads. Lest we forget, megalodon went extinct because it was simply too big. So before panic sets in too significantly for the likes of WPP, Publicis and Dentsu, and the myriad independent agencies that have made a living feeding off the fish that the sharks don’t eat, this kind of bigger isn’t always seen as better. But to hear Wren and Krakowsky tell it, this merger makes more sense today than ever. They have their eyes on the Googles and Metas of the world. So much that Krakowsky referred the combined company as a platform rather than a holdco. “Being a part of what is now a platform, essentially a company with exceptional talent and reach and capabilities, and knowing that you can bring those to bear for your client, or that they’re going to give you an opportunity, as John [Wren] says, to build a more interesting career — there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it inside our organization,” he told analysts and reporters on a Monday morning conference call with Wren and both companies’ CFOs. The combined entity would become by far the largest holding company in the communications world, with an expected cash flow of more than $3 billion, according to the information provided by the companies. The principals also cite the complementary resources and geographies. A few examples: But the truth is, both companies needed to do this. Of the six sources reached for this story, all noted that IPG has not had a good stretch the last few years, having lost Amazon, General Motors and several other large and small clients that outweighed its gains. Two sources even said they see Omnicom’s acquisition as a bit of a bailout. “I think this is a very welcome distraction from what has been a disastrous year for IPG,” said one executive outside both companies, who declined to speak for attribution. Added David Jones, CEO of Brandtech Group, a rival to both holdcos: The acquisition “makes huge sense in the short term — both have been having their lunch eaten by Publicis, and IPG declined last year in organic growth. This gives both of them a story for their shareholders. It gives the merged company the ability to carry out financial re-engineering and restatements that will help the numbers look better in the short term.” Ouch. Meantime, the union doesn’t come cheaply. In the Monday conference call, Wren cited $450 million in “one-time cash cost” to close the deal and achieve $750 million in “cost synergies” — which includes layoffs among the 100,000 employees of both holdcos. Oddly, Wren did add, and employees of both companies should take note: “Any employee listening to this, if you’re associated with any revenue stream at all, you’re gold, don’t worry about it.” Observers of the deal don’t think things will end up quite so magnanimously for staffers, particularly those in back-office roles. “This deal will no doubt create a lot of uncertainty for staff and clients on both sides,” said Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “Notwithstanding the cost synergies (and implications this will bring), clients will be considering how their requirements will be met during an extreme period of transition and transformation.” How is the rest of the agency world affected? For one, it will most likely set off a chain reaction of M&A, because no other holding company can stay put as they are. “I expect to see more M&A activity on the back of this deal,” said Kangisser. “It’s easy to forget there are a number of very well funded, and highly acquisitive challenger groups who will look to fill this vacuum and provide clients with greater optionality.” “Start looking at all these other combinations,” said another high-level agency executive who declined to speak on the record. “The other guys are going to have to do something. I think this is the starting gun for major, major consolidation.” Every source reached for this story had their own scenario that could unfold. WPP, which has just been leapfrogged in size and scale, has long been the subject of breakup rumors. Havas just got spun out by parent company Vivendi, making it easier to pick by the likes of, say, Accenture or Dentsu. And Publicis, which analysts see as neck and neck with Omnicom in its success in the marketplace, isn’t likely to be left in the dust, despite already having acquired Influential and Mars United Commerce earlier this year. Nor should Omnicom itself be precluded from other purchases. Wren said the the $3 billion in cash flow would allow the company to continue to be acquisitive. For independents who have staked their claim to being the antidote to the holdco system and process, Christmas seemingly has come early. The deal “provides the independents the room to be able to articulate their propositions,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester. “Their counterpoint is skill, and this just helps frame their proposition of being able to balance the buying scale that they’re accumulating with the performance scale that they’ve developed.” And how will clients feel about this? Amazon just left IPG and gave some of its media business to Omnicom. Will this stir up unhappiness? Wren and Krakowsky poo-poo’d any notion that clients will have a problem with the acquisition. Jay Wilson, an analyst at Gartner, noted that the size of client will impact how much they’re affected. “It’s unlikely any single client will see an immediate impact on its relationship with existing IPG or Omnicom agencies, and those with large relationships at a holding company level will probably see the slowest transition — for example to a new hold-co wide data spine like IPG’s Acxiom,” said Wilson. “Clients of single agencies within these networks may be the first affected, if and when the new organization decides to merge individual agencies, as many hold co’s have been doing in recent years.” There’s been a lot of speculation about the value of Acxiom to Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG, but an ongoing court case over the data warehouse adds another layer. How Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of IPG keeps marketers guessing. The acquisition is expected to yield $750 million in annual cost synergies within two years.

Oracle fell nearly 8% in extended trading after it reported quarterly earnings that slightly missed estimates and the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance. The software provider reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase. It reported $4.21 billion in profit, or $1.47 per share, for the three months that ended in late November. Oracle's cloud services business, which has customers including OpenAI, xAI, and Nvidia, grew 12% from last year and made up 77% of the company's total quarterly revenue. Oracle said it expects revenue growth between 7% and 9% for the current quarter. This would bring revenue expectations to about $14.3 billion, below analyst estimates of $14.65 billion. The company's business is booming due to sky-high demand for computing from artificial intelligence companies seeking to train their models. Oracle's stock has surged 80% this year, boosting its market value from below $165 billion in late 2022 to north of $500 billion. The enterprise-computing giant's stock decline on Monday resulted from high expectations going into the results. Fiscal second-quarter expectations are elevated coming out of a bullish September analyst day and long-term revenue targets that imply a multi-year growth acceleration, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note last week. At the analyst day in September, Oracle forecast annual revenue to rise to at least $104 billion in fiscal year 2029, a sign of its continued growth in cloud infrastructure. Investors are likely also reacting to mixed results. Key metrics include capital expenditure, which was above consensus; growth of infrastructure-as-a-service, which was in line with consensus; and growth of backlog, an Oracle product, which missed estimates. Oracle competes with Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business. "Our cloud is faster and is less expensive than other clouds," Oracle's CEO Safra Catz said on an earnings call on Monday. "We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads." On Monday, the company also announced a deal with Meta to use Oracle's AI cloud infrastructure to develop the social media giant's Llama AI models. Oracle's soaring stock price this year has boosted the net worth of Larry Ellison, who cofounded the company and is chief technology officer. His Oracle stock — he holds more than 40% of the company's shares — puts him third on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, worth $234.8 billion as of Monday. Jump to

They also awaited new U.S. inflation data set for release this week. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% to end at 6,034.91, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25% to 19,687.24. Both indexes booked back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, sliding 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to 44,247.83. Oracle shares slumped 6.7% after the database software company posted fiscal second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates. The stock has jumped around 68% this year. "[The market] has been narrowing over the past week," CFRA Research's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said to CNBC. "Investors are waiting to see if that simply is your traditional seasonal softness in mid-December, and I think [they] are expecting the participation to broaden out once again as the market does indeed go through an end-of-year pop." Alphabet was a breakout winner of the session, advancing 5.6%, on the back of Google making a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of its new chip. That puts its year-to-date gains at more than 32%. This comes after the major averages fell on Monday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.6%, dropping from recent records as shares of Nvidia declined. Shares of the chip giant were more than 2% lower Tuesday, extending losses seen in the previous session after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the company for possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. By contrast, Meta Platforms, which also saw losses on Monday, was up 1% Tuesday. Investors are now waiting on the U.S. consumer price index report, which is due Wednesday and could influence how the Federal Reserve proceeds on interest rates at its Dec. 17-18 meeting. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast that headline inflation rose 0.3% in November and 2.7% over the prior 12 months. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to finish at 44,247.83 on Tuesday. The broad market S&P 500 also fell 0.3% to settle at 6,034.91, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% to finish at 19,687.24. — Sean Conlon U.S. Steel shares plunged late Tuesday afternoon on a report that President Joe Biden plans to block the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel later this month. U.S. Steel stock was briefly halted due to volatility. The company's shares were down more than 9% after trading resumed. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Biden will block the $14.1 billion sale once the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States submits its review to him by Dec. 22 or Dec. 23. — Spencer Kimball Kroger and Albertsons shares moved in opposite directions after a U.S. judge nixed the grocers' planned $25 billion merger. Kroger shares surged 4%, while Albertsons shares tumbled more than 3% and hit a 52-week low. The Biden administration had fought against the deal, arguing the combination would reduce competition and lead to higher prices at the supermarket. However, Kroger pushed back against this argument. Management claimed becoming a larger entity would result in cost savings that could then be passed on to their customers. Kroger shares have outperformed the market this year, with a 32% gain, while Albertsons shares have fallen 22%. — Christina Cheddar Berk President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans may not go into effect for some time, according to Wolfe Research's Stephanie Roth. "We don't expect sweeping tariffs to go into effect until late 2025 — Republicans are reportedly discussing how to potentially leverage tariff revenue in a broader fiscal package, which increases the odds tariffs happen late in 2025 rather than early," the firm's chief economist wrote. If a 10% universal baseline tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. were to be implemented, Roth estimates the U.S. economy will be hit up to 1.2% in gross domestic product, and inflation will see a boost of 1.1%. — Sean Conlon The market may likely see more upside over the coming weeks, according to Barclays. "Momentum seems so strong that a continued rally seems the path of least resistance for the rest of 2024," analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a note this week. Rajadhyaksha also said bond markets are expected to be "range-bound," given that investors are awaiting more details on President-elect Donald Trump's policies. — Sean Conlon The S&P 500 has had more declining than advancing stocks in each of the last six completed trading days, according to BTIG data. Despite that, it has been a winning period for the broad index in an unusual twist. The S&P 500 is up around 0.3% during that timeframe. There has never been a six-day run with both negative daily breadth and a positive overall return in the past two decades, according to BTIG. — Alex Harring While stocks may be due for more gains in 2025, Citi believes investors should also brace for more volatility given an uncertain policy outlook and raised valuations. "We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025," the firm's U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote. "Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promise, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle." The strategist has a year-end 2025 base case target for the S&P 500 of 6,500, allowing for gains in the mid-single digits next year. However, his bull case of 6,900 and bear case of 5,100 allow for a broad range of outcomes. "Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year," Chronert continued. — Sean Conlon Oracle shares shed about 8% and are on pace for their worst day since Dec.12, 2023. The decline came on the heels of a disappointing fiscal second-quarter earnings report that fell short of Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Oracle also issued a weak current-quarter outlook. The drop in shares comes as Oracle heads for its best year since 1999 as investors snatch up shares of cloud infrastructure players assisting companies with the demand storage needs for artificial intelligence models. — Samantha Subin During Tuesday's trading session, eight stocks in the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, just three stocks were trading at their 52-week lows: Baxter, Centene and Teleflex. — Lisa Kailai Han, Christopher Hayes Semiconductor stocks dropped on Tuesday, putting downward pressure on the market. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) each slid more than 2%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was near flat and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2%. Among the worst-performing semi stocks was Broadcom, which slid about 4%. Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor also each dropped more than 3%. Notably, artificial intelligence darling Nvidia shed nearly 2%. — Alex Harring Shares of Alphabet rose more than 5% in afternoon trading following Google's breakthrough in quantum computing. The company said its new chip, known as Willow, is able to decrease errors "exponentially" as the amount of qubits, which are considered the units of information in quantum computing, are increased. This "cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years," Google also said. The stock's move brings its year-to-date gains to more than 32%. Shares have also risen more than 24% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon The dollar index rose 0.4% Tuesday to 106.58. Against the euro, the dollar gained 0.5%. The euro last traded at 1.05 against the greenback. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened 0.6% to 152.13 yen, and climbed 0.4% against the won to 1,434.23. In December, the greenback has gained 1.6% and 2.8% against the won and the yen, respectively. — Hakyung Kim Walgreens Boots Alliance shares popped 18% in midday trading, after briefly halting for volatility, following a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar, that said the pharmacy chain is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The deal could be completed as soon as early next year if talks don't fall apart, the report said. Sycamore Partners declined CNBC's request for comment. The move would take Walgreens off the public market after it was booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year. The stock is down 57% in 2024. — Sarah Min Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: For the full list, read here. — Pia Singh There were just 209 advancers in the S&P 500, with the index itself little changed as investors awaited this week's consumer prices data. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors, up 2% and 0.8%, respectively. By contrast, real estate stocks slid 1%. Boeing was the No. 1 stock in the broader index, gaining more than 5% after Reuters, citing people familiar, said the company restarted production of its 737 Max jetliner. On the other hand, Super Micro Computer and Oracle were lower by 8% and 7%, respectively. — Sarah Min The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) dipped 0.5% on Tuesday, putting the fund on track for its fourth straight losing session and sixth in the past seven, according to FactSet data. The declines have also come during the session. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out in a post on social media site X, the RSP has seen intraday declines in six straight sessions. It would need to rally and close above $184.46 to snap that streak on Tuesday. The struggles for the RSP are notable because the equal weight fund can be a proxy for market breadth. While the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech names over the past year, the behavior of the RSP is more indicative of the broader large cap stock universe. — Jesse Pound China-focused exchange-traded funds relinquished some gains on Tuesday, a day after the country promised "more proactive" fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) and iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) each slid just over 4.5% in late morning trading. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) also dropped more than 4.5%. Despite those slides, all three funds are still higher compared with where they started the week. That underscores the strength of Monday's rally. — Alex Harring The Trump Trade is already running out of steam, according to Wolfe Research. "Uncertainty in the first half of 2025 should put a damper on the 'Trump Trade,'" the firm's chief investment strategist Chris Senyek wrote Tuesday. "So in the meantime we'd continue to own the Mag 7!" The Trump Trade will have three parts, Senyek wrote, with the first part unwinding in the immediate aftermath of the election. Senyek expects the second part of the trade will likely come in the first 100 days of the president-elect's term. The third, he said, will come in the second half of 2025, as incoming data indicates whether Trump's policy agenda is a positive or negative for economic growth. For now, as the first part of the Trump Trade finishes its course, Senyek said he would stick to the "Magnificent Seven" that are not in the "crosshairs of policy risk" through the first half of 2025. — Sarah Min Shares of Sirius XM slid more than 8% on Tuesday after the radio operator appointed a new chief operating officer and announced cost-cutting initiatives. The firm said it will target an initial incremental $200 million of annualized savings as it exits 2025, citing "marketplace headwinds." The company said it will also move its marketing and other resources away from "high-cost, high-churn audiences in streaming." — Yun Li Stocks were relatively unchanged Tuesday morning. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose almost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.2%. — Sean Conlon Shares of Alaska Air Group rose nearly 11% in premarket trading on the heels of the carrier raising its fourth-quarter earnings forecast and authorizing a $1 billion stock buyback. The company now expects earnings to come in between 40 cents and 50 cents per share, up from its prior guidance of 20 cents to 40 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share for the period. Alaska Air also announced it is going to launch new nonstop flights to Japan and Korea in 2025 as part of its plan to deliver $1 billion in profit by 2027. The stock has outperformed the broader market this year, jumping more than 38% year to date. Shares have also gained around 36% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon, Leslie Josephs Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas appears to be cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the auto industry heading in 2025. "The US election result has extended the 'ICE is Nice' trade for a bit longer but keep on the lookout for hidden value in the EV ecosystem into the 2H. We recommend investors stay nimble and selective given the volatility of policy outcomes," Jonas said in a note to clients on Tuesday. "ICE" stands for internal combustion engine, the traditional alternative to electric vehicles. Morgan Stanley made two changes to its ratings of auto stocks: an upgrade of General Motors to equal weight from underweight, and hiking the price target on Tesla to $400 per share from $310. The new price target is just 2.5% above where Tesla closed on Monday, but the stock is still Jonas' top pick in the industry. Tesla could be a beneficiary from the new Trump administration if change leads to regulatory changes that usher along an autonomous driving future. "If the Trump Administration looks to clear the path for a Federal framework on autonomous vehicles, we believe investors will eventually appreciate that the discussion of AVs is also a discussion about EVs. Among a range of policy tools, we see tariffs as a lever to help accelerate onshoring of enabling technology underpinned by more de-risked supply chain," Jonas said. — Jesse Pound These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han Small businesses sentiment popped to its highest level in nearly three and a half years following November's presidential election, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index hit 101.7 for November, an increase of 8 points and the best reading since June 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had forecast a reading of 94.8. "The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners," said Bill Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist. "Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations." Along with the higher reading for the headline index, the share of business owners expecting a better economy ahead jumped 41 points from October to a net 36%, the highest since June 2020. — Jeff Cox Fears surrounding aluminum packaging company Ball are overstated, according to Mizuho, which believes investors should buy the recent pullback in shares. The firm upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and maintained its $67 price target, which is 16% above where shares closed on Monday. "Despite recent misplaced concerns about pricing and volume, we don't believe earnings are at risk, or that fundamentals have changed. We believe the recent pullback in the shares represents a good buying opportunity and an attractive entry point," analyst Edlain Rodriguez wrote in a Tuesday note. The company shut down around 15% of its manufacturing capacity to account for lower consumer demand post-pandemic. "That capacity closure has better positioned Ball for the medium-term as demand gradually normalizes," Rodriguez said. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares were down slightly a day after the chipmaker pulled back on China launching an investigation into the company possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. The stock was last down 0.3% in the premarket. On Monday, it fell 2.6%, leading to Nvidia's longest losing streak since September. — Fred Imbert Citi believes Broadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter results will top expectations ahead of the company's earnings release on Thursday. Analyst Christopher Danely raised his price target on shares to $205 from $175, implying 14.6% upside potential from Monday's close. Danely also reiterated his buy rating on the stock. Danely estimates Broadcom could report up to $15 billion in sales, or a 7% rise from the previous quarter. The company's non-AI semiconductor business will likely drive its better-than-consensus results, he added. Current-quarter guidance could be held back on a slowdown in orders from Google, a leading AI customer, Danely said. "We do expect business to ramp from Meta throughout C25 and pick up the slack," Danely wrote in a Tuesday note. — Hakyung Kim South Korean markets led gains in Asia on Tuesday, with the country's blue-chip Kospi surging 2.43% and seeing its best day in almost three months, while the small-cap Kosdaq spiked 5.52%. That comes as the country continues to grapple with the fallout of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. Other markets in Asia also climbed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.53% and mainland China's CSI 300 rising by 0.73%. — Lim Hui Jie European stocks opened lower on Tuesday, as investors reacted to Chinese import and export figures that came in below expectations in November. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was 0.25% lower shortly after the opening bell, with all major bourses trading in negative territory. Read the latest here. — Chloe Taylor Check out some of the companies making headlines in extended trading: Read the full list here. — Brian Evans Stock futures were little changed on Monday, after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite pulled back from their respective highs. S&P 500 futures ticked down 0.03%, while Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.01%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline. — Brian Evans Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Is NextEra Energy (NEE) the Best Wind Power and Solar Stock to Invest in Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-nee-best-wind-215341237.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Wind Power and Solar Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best wind power and stocks to invest in now. According to a report by the World Economic Forum published on November 8, the US election result is expected to have a significant impact on the transition to renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy stocks fell sharply following the election, as Donald Trump's victory is anticipated to have a negative short-term impact on current climate policies. The president-elect has proposed policies that include increasing natural gas pipelines, ending offshore wind energy projects, and boosting fossil fuel production by easing restrictions on drilling on federal lands. He has also expressed intentions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and to support nuclear energy production. Despite these challenges, analysts predict that the boom in renewable energy in the US is unlikely to be dramatically slowed. The Inflation Reduction Act passed during the outgoing administration, is expected to inject $1 trillion of spending into green energy, with estimates that 85% of the money has gone to districts that elected Republicans. This financial support, along with existing opposition to the curtailment of renewable energy, suggests that the long-term trajectory of the energy transition remains uncertain but potentially resilient. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 13, Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, discussed the potential implications of a Trump presidency on renewable energy such as wind and solar. Rhind noted that the playbook on energy policy was already seen in the previous Trump administration. The Trump administration has historically been more supportive of fossil fuels and less focused on renewable energy. Therefore, stocks and sectors favored by the Biden administration, such as solar and wind, might see a downturn. Rhind suggested that the overall narrative may seem like it's shifting back toward traditional energy sources. However, Elon Musk seems to be playing an integral role in the Trump administration, and he has been a proponent of climate policies, with his electric vehicle (EV) industry and other businesses, which suggests that energy transition policies may not be as impactful as some might expect today. While the outcome of the US election and the anticipated policies of the new administration pose short-term challenges to renewable energy, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic. To compile our list of the 10 best wind power and solar stocks to invest in now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 wind and solar energy stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in wind and solar power generation. The company operates through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is recognized for its massive investments in clean energy infrastructure and commitment to a sustainable future. NextEra Energy Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) experience in developing and operating large-scale renewable energy projects makes it a leader in the industry. The company is investing heavily in the development of new solar and wind projects. The company's wind repowering program has expanded to approximately 1.6 gigawatts of wind projects owned by NextEra Energy Partners through 2026. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is also investing in the development of new solar projects, with a focus on low-cost solar and battery storage. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is capitalizing on the growing demand for renewable energy by expanding its solar and wind offerings. The company added approximately 3 gigawatts to its backlog in Q3, bringing its total backlog to approximately 11 gigawatts. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has also announced incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts till 2030. Overall, NEE ranks 3rd on our list of best wind power and stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Ways To Invest In Tesla Beyond Buying TSLA Stock

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most closely followed and debated stocks. That’s what happens when you create a new industry (electric vehicles) and trade in a price range from $100 to $400, and back to $100 again, all within a few years time. And let’s not forget the emergence of Tesla founder Elon Musk on the political front. All this may lead investors to wonder how best to get exposure to Tesla stock, other than buying it directly. That’s where exchange-traded funds can represent a wide range of “access points” for different types of objectives. Popular indexes like the S&P 500 have ETFs that allow investors to profit from its declines, to earn extra income from it via option positions, and to add leverage. More recently, allowing investors to put those types of enhancements around individual stocks has been a priority for some ETF product creators. But in the case of Tesla, we might just have the widest array of choices for how to “drive” your profits forward. Here are seven I picked out, and how I’d potentially use them. Note that these are my own observations and research. They are not recommendations, simply a way to expand the range of what is possible for investors who don’t drill down on this as I have been doing for decades.

AMZN is 22% and Home Depot (HD) checks in at 8%. So nearly half of XLY is in these three stocks. XLY has $24.3 billion in assets under management and a low expense ratio of 0.09%. I want to own Tesla but with some diversification around it. This is one way in which my approach to ETF investing is likely very different from most. I like concentrated funds, since it allows me to zero in on a smaller basket of names that at times are really all I want from that market segment. I don't need a piece of 93 stocks in a single sector! This is for investors who prefer to reduce the risk of any single stock. The focus of this ETF is long-term growth of capital achieved by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products and technologies, such as autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, adaptive robotics, neural networks, reusable rockets and advanced batteries. Tesla is ARKQ’s top holding (17% of assets). ARKQ has total assets of $968 million and an expense ratio of 0.75%. Complements TSLA exposure with allocations to defense, cybersecurity and space exploration. Volatility. Made a big “round trip” in price the past three years, losing 50% and then gaining 100% to net out to a break-even over that period. I want to own TSLA and other autonomous tech stocks, but not Amazon. This is also a diversification move around Tesla stock, though using a thematic group of stocks instead of just those in the same consumer discretionary sector. This is TSLA times 2, though it is not always that simple. As with all ETFs that, like this one, employ leverage, the concept of making 2x the gain or loss of TSLA should be assumed to only be good on a daily basis.Still when TSLA goes on one of those manic upside runs, 2x is an attractive consideration to me. TSLL has an expense ratio of 0.96%. “All bulled up” on Tesla, with potential to make twice as much as owning the regular common stock. What Tesla giveth twice as much, it also taketh away twice as much. Since I'm a chartist at the core, I can decide to buy a good TSLA chart or buy a good TSLL chart with half the assets at risk. This ETF might appeal to those who are comfortable with leverage, pursuing twice the gain with twice the risk. Leveraged ETFs are a relatively new creation. Single inverse ETFs have been around since 2006. And that means I've been using them liberally for 18 years. The ones that move opposite major market indexes have been a "go-to" for me as an offense-defense investor since prior to the global financial crisis. Newer on the scene are single stock inverse ETFs, such as the ones offered by Direxion, T-Rex and other fund firms. Again, the daily objective means that longer time periods often will not be the mirror image of the underlying "long" stock performance. TSLS has an expense ratio of 1.07%. Efficient way to essentially “short” TSLA, on a 1:1 daily basis. Investors tend to undereducate themselves on the “math of investment loss.” In other words, if TSLA goes up 20% as it has done in short time periods many times, this would drop approximately 20%. But that means you need to make 25% just to get back to even, not 20%. When I think TSLA is overpriced short-to-intermediate term, and want to try to profit from a potential decline of some magnitude. TSLS could appeal to those who wish to try to profit from a decline in TSLA. Note that big “round trip” move I noted at the start of this article.

That would not have worked well if held throughout 2024. But don't be fooled by that full-year summary. During the course of this, its first full year of existence, TSLZ has had 1-month up moves of 80%, 50% and 30%. These are tactical vehicles, period. Potentially a “cleaner” way to try to capitalize on declines in Tesla stock than using put options. That’s because TSLA is so volatile, buying options can be very expensive. I own TSLA but am concerned about its near-term price picture, so I can consider this to hedge some of that, and try to avoid the full downside risk. Or, I can use this to try to profit from the next major dip in TSLA. For those who don’t just think the stock will fall, but do so quickly, this ETF, like other inverse funds, aims to be held for short time periods. This is another in the series from YieldMax ETFs that I've written about here recently. TSLY aims to deliver a very high income return and a total return of about 80% of the ups and downs of TSLA stock. TSLY has total assets of $1.0 billion and an expense ratio of 1.0% Big income payout, aims to capture about 80% of up moves in TSLA on a total return basis. Tends to track about 80% of the downside in the stock. Bullish on TSLA but prefer to earn more of my total return as income, with some upside potential beyond that. This relatively new ETF might appeal to those who want to ride along with Tesla, but exchange some potential capital appreciation for current income. Finally, another one from YieldMax, but a departure from their core product line. This fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.99%, started trading in May, so I'll use this directly from the fund management firm: YieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a synthetic covered put strategy on TSLA, while providing indirect short exposure to the share price of TSLA. CRSH seeks to benefit when the TSLA share price decreases, however CRSH’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the TSLA share price is limited. CRSH seeks to manage potential losses (i.e., cap losses if the TSLA share price experiences significant gains) by purchasing OTM call options. Big income payout. This brand new ETF is only for the very bold, and who are bearish on Tesla stock. It produces a high income level, but declined more than 40% of its price during its first six months in existence. The good news on TSLA: it has more than doubled since last spring. The bad news on TSLA: that giant move brought it back to where it traded about three years ago. I'm no fan of "dead money” (old Wall Street term) especially when it comes in the form of a political football, which was halfway to a meme stock even before the founder ended up in a potentially influential quasi-government position. There's a lot to consider here, and this story is much more complex than a lot of places I can decide to put my money. Knowing that these ETFs exist is step one. Understanding them is step two. Determining how to use them, when to use them and how to avoid getting burned from anything related to Tesla's volatile underlying stock price movement is all part of the "next level" of learning how to design portfolios for modern markets.

Title: AMD downgraded after BI report on weak demand for its AI chips among AWS customers

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:20:51Z

Bank of America downgraded AMD after a Business Insider report raised concerns about demand for the tech company's AI chips. Analysts at BofA cut AMD shares to a "neutral," citing "higher competitive risk" in the AI market, according to an analyst note published on Monday. BofA analysts also lowered their AMD GPU sales forecast for next year to $8 billion, from $8.9 billion, implying a roughly 4% market share. AMD's stock dropped roughly 5.6% on Monday, after falling about 2% on Friday. Its shares are down about 5% so far this year. The declines follow BI's report on Friday that said Amazon Web Services was "not yet" seeing strong enough customer demand to deploy AMD's AI chips through its cloud platform. Bank of America cited this AWS customer-demand issue, alongside Nvidia's dominance and the growing preference for custom chips from Marvell and Broadcom, as factors limiting AMD's growth potential. "Recently largest cloud customer Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD," the Bank of America note said, referring to AWS's in-house AI chip Trainium and its close partnerships with Marvell and Nvidia. Spokespeople from Amazon and AMD declined to comment on the story last week. After publication of both articles, the companies got back in touch with BI and shared comments. In an email to BI, AMD's spokesperson said it has a "great relationship" with AWS. "We are actively engaged with AWS and end customers on AI opportunities," the spokesperson said. AWS's spokesperson said in an email to BI, "AWS and AMD work together closely, as we continue to make AWS the best place to run AMD silicon. Based on the success of AMD CPUs on AWS, we are actively looking at offering AMD's AI chips." AMD recently increased its GPU sales forecast, just a year after launching its line of AI chips. But its GPU market share is still far behind Nvidia's. Bank of America said AMD could still succeed in the AI chip market, in part due to Nvidia's supply constraints and premium pricing, making it a strong alternative, especially for internal cloud workloads. It also said AMD is well positioned in the server chip market, as rival Intel continues to struggle. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: China Probes Nvidia Amid Escalating A.I. Chip Tensions With US: What to Know

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:12:44Z

Just two weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang lauded China’s contributions to A.I. research in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company amid escalating geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and uncertainties around the incoming Trump administration.

You can opt out anytime. China’s State Administration of Market Regulation is looking into Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli company that makes computer networking equipment, Chinese media reported today (Dec. 9). China approved Nvidia’s $6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox under the condition that the Israeli company would provide samples of new products to rivals within 90 days of making them available to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg, which noted that China’s approval was needed due to the size of its economy and semiconductor market. The deal also received merger control approval from authorities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico and the European Union. In a statement to Observer, Nvidia said it is happy to answer any questions regulators have about its business. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” said the chipmaker. “We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business.” The investigation is the latest jab in an escalating semiconductor battle between the U.S. and China, which was described by China’s Commerce Ministry as an “abuse of control measures” and a “typical act of economic coercion.” Earlier this month, the Biden administration enacted another round of chip export controls in the country, following previous efforts to curb China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. The country retaliated by banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony and other superhard materials to the U.S. These materials have various high-tech and military applications. Previous measures from the U.S. have limited Nvidia from selling advanced GPUs to China since 2022. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to maintain these measures and the Biden administration’s tough-on-China stance. Nvidia shares fell more than 3 percent today in response to the news. The past year has been lucrative for the chipmaker, which has seen its stock surging by nearly 200 percent to claim a market cap of $3.38 trillion, making it the world’s second most valuable company behind Apple (AAPL) and boosting the wealth of its founder and CEO to an estimated $120.5 billion. Surging demand for the GPUs underpinning A.I. applications has propelled Nvidia to become the industry leader in A.I. chips, with a 70 percent to 95 percent share of the market, according to Mizuho Securities. The chipmaker, which reported a 94 percent jump in revenue year-over-year to $35 billion during the last quarter, counts tech giants like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) among its largest clients. In China, however, Nvidia has lost ground amid tough export controls. Its sales in the country made up 15 percent of its total sales in the quarter ended September, a dip from 26 percent a year ago. Huang himself has urged for a positive relationship between the U.S. and China when it comes to technological advances, lauding China’s contributions to A.I. research. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” the CEO said while receiving an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology last month.

Nvidia's stock dipped by 2% as news broke this morning. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As the trade wars escalate between the US and China, Nvidia has found itself in the crossfire following accusations of possible anti-trust violations by the Chinese Government – per local media. The spotlight is on Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox – a conditional approval of which was granted, provided Nvidia would follow strict anti-monopoly guidelines. Following similar inquiries by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) a few months back, Nvidia is now taking flak from both sides. The probe scrutinizes Team Green’s purchase of the Israeli-American networking firm Mellanox in 2020. Mellanox is the backbone of Nvidia's AI servers, allowing multiple GPUs within a DGX system to be connected via InfiniBand and Ethernet switches. The $7 billion acquisition was approved by Chinese authorities, stipulating that Nvidia will not use this partnership to discriminate against domestic firms. Likewise, Nvidia was obligated to notify rivals about upcoming products within 90 days. Coming hot on the heels of another wave of sanctions on 140 Chinese companies—now prohibited from importing High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) among other chip-making tools—a retaliatory response was expected. This appears to be part of China’s strategy to fight back against US sanctions, with recent reports suggesting a 20% price cut on domestic goods to counteract Trump’s tariffs. When asked to comment on the matter by PCMag, Nvidia said, "Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." Since the news broke, Nvidia's stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted by 2% in pre-market trading early in the morning. These regulations are not mere formalities, as evidenced by their impacts on many multi-trillion dollar corporations. Google, for example, is under serious pressure from the DoJ and could be forced to sell off Google Chrome for $20 billion over complaints of monopolistic practices. Nonetheless, it could take months or even years before a conclusion is reached, giving Nvidia some breathing space. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: Nvidia stock falls almost 3% as it faces an antitrust probe in China

Time Published: 2024-12-09T17:48:18Z

Nvidia’s (NVDA-2.72%) shares fell by almost 3% during mid-day trading on Monday after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker. Fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.53%) and Marvell (MRVL+8.18%) also saw their shares fall by 4.4% and 5.2%, respectively. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday it has launched an investigation into the U.S.-based chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws with its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, according to China Central Television. Nvidia bought the chip designer for $6.9 billion in 2020 and was given conditional approval by Chinese authorities that included a requirement to not bundle or tie together its products with Mellanox. The two chip companies were also required to continue supplying on fair terms and to make sure technology was compatible with chips manufactured by Chinese firms. Other measures were designed to address tightening U.S. export controls targeting China’s chip firms. In September, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%) were accused by Texas-based startup Xockets of monopolistic practices, patent infringement, and violating federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that Nvidia has infringed on Xockets’ patents since its acquisition of Mellanox, which had adopted the startup’s technology in 2016 without its knowledge or permission. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia and Microsoft of infringing on Xockets’ patent for advanced data processing units, or DPUs, “that enable accelerated computing and artificial intelligence” in data centers. Meanwhile, the Biden administration recently announced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said. Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were also added to the U.S. trade blacklist.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say

Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.71%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+2.57%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.67%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.10%) and Block (SQ-0.47%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK-0.12%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Nvidia stock slides as China opens antitrust probe against AI chip heavyweight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped 2.5% on Monday after China opened an antitrust investigation into the chip giant amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over artificial intelligence dominance. The probe is aimed at Nvidia's practices regarding possible anti-monopoly violations. It is also set to examine its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, a purchase that was approved by China's State Administration for Market Regulation under the condition that the chipmaker avoid discriminating against Chinese companies. According to a Chinese media report, the government believes Nvidia’s $7 billion purchase of the Israeli computer networking equipment maker may have violated Beijing's anti-monopoly rules. In a statement released on Monday morning, an Nvidia spokesperson wrote, "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The probe comes about a week after the Biden administration implemented another round of semiconductor export restrictions aimed at limiting China's access to advanced chips. The latest US measures include curbing high-bandwidth memory chips shipped to China, crucial components for AI training. “As China continues to struggle to keep up with the most leading-edge AI chips, they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down," Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning (video above). The Chinese probe against the most important US chipmaker also comes ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Trump has threatened increased tariffs as part of his policy. "This isn’t just a regulatory issue; it’s a calculated geopolitical manoeuvre," Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, wrote on Monday. "China is sending a strong message that it won’t hesitate to push back, and Nvidia’s targeting is a harbinger of more aggressive measures to come." Nvidia shares have not participated in the overall Trump post-election rally over the past month. The stock is up slightly more than 1% since Trump's win. Nvidia stock is up almost 190% so far this year. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks struggled for a foothold on Monday as Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped amid a Chinese antitrust probe while investors looked ahead at this week's expected inflation data that will set the stage for the Federal Reserve's final interest-rate decision of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose slightly, coming off a losing week for the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2%, in the wake of fresh records for both. The next test for Wall Street stocks comes in a consumer inflation report, seen as influential to the Federal Reserve's looming policy decision. The November Consumer Price Index on Wednesday will stress-test widespread expectation for a quarter-point rate cut on Dec. 18, after the latest monthly jobs report failed to shake that conviction. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares slipped after China opened a probe into the chipmaker for potential breaches of its anti-monopoly laws. The company's lead in AI chips has put it in the middle of the US-China wrangles over tech. But US-listed Chinese stocks popped after Beijing made its first move toward loosening monetary policy in over a decade, signaling more and bolder stimulus is on the way. Shares in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) and XPeng (XPEV, 9868.HK) were among the premarket gainers, after stocks in Hong Kong jumped. Markets appear to be taking the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria in stride, with haven asset gold (GC=F) rising modestly. Optimism for China's economy is seen as eclipsing any worries around geopolitical stresses in Syria, South Korea, France, and elsewhere.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) opened slightly higher while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) wavered around the flatline. Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2% with Nvidia shares declining more than 2% after a Chinese media report said Beijing was looking into the AI chip maker as the chip war between China and the US escala Investors await this week's consumer inflation report, seen as a critical data point for the Federal Reserve when policy makers meeting on December 18.

Title: AMD Tumbles 2% Pre-Market After BofA Downgrade and AI Market Warnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just got a reality check from Bank of America. The firm downgraded the chipmaker from Buy to Neutral, slashed the price target from $180 to $155, and trimmed its 2025 earnings forecast by up to 8%. Why? Two words: fierce competition. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI accelerator market with an 80%+ share, while AMD scrambles to hold onto a meager 4%. Even Amazon, one of AMDs biggest cloud customers, is cozying up to NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell. Add a potential slowdown in PC demand next year, and AMDs near-term outlook looks dicey. But its not all doom and gloom. AMD has been making some serious power moves, like acquiring Silo AI and ZT Systems to solidify its AI strategy. In Q3, its Data Center segment revenue soared 122%, fueled by deals with heavyweights like Microsoft and Meta. AMDs low debt and $4.5 billion in cash give it a safety net, while its long-term plans to generate over $5 billion in GPU revenue in 2024 keep investors intrigued. And lets not forget: AMDs still the go-to for killer CPUs and GPUs, even if gaming and embedded segments had a rough quarter. The majority of Wall Street analysts are still screaming Strong Buy, with an average price target of $190thats a juicy 37% upside from here. But year-to-date, AMD is only up 3.3%, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQs (^IXIC) 34.5% rally. The takeaway? AMDs long-term AI potential is massive, but near-term risks are real. This is a stock for investors who like their opportunities bigand their risks bigger. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: From ChatGPT to Temu: ranking top Internet services in 2024

Subscribe to receive notifications of new posts: 2024-12-09 Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users' needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflareâs observations and a review of the yearâs DNS trends. Building on similar reports weâve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on: Generative AI Social Media Ecommerce Video Streaming News Messaging Metaverse & Gaming Financial Services Cryptocurrency Services As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesnât always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service â it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank. This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News. This year, weâre also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore. Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics. Since 2021, weâve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Googleâs top spot. Itâs important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains. Google Facebook Apple TikTok Amazon Web Services Microsoft Instagram YouTube Amazon WhatsApp Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year. Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube. Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot. Close to the Top 10 were Appleâs iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoftâs Outlook. In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year. In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on Xâs performance in the Social Media category below. Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023. ChatGPT (OpenAI) Character.AI Codeium QuillBot Claude (Anthropic) Perplexity GitHub Copilot Wordtune Poe Tabnine Significant changes occurred below ChatGPTâs first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool. Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6. This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year. Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October â in November, it ranked #6 on weekends. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends. Google Gemini, Googleâs AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September. Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAIâs announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API. Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include: ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends. Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT. Codeium entered the top 300 in July. It ranked higher on weekdays than weekends. According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention. Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall. Facebook TikTok Instagram X Snapchat LinkedIn Discord Kwai Pinterest Reddit In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October. LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Hereâs the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024: Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November. The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Hereâs a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category: Letâs move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident. As weâve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didnât break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends. Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220.Â Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. Itâs worth noting that Threads also uses Instagramâs cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasnât impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings). Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking: Instagramâs best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey. Xâs best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted Xâs ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics. X performed better on weekdays, while LinkedIn ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. Snapchat and Discord performed better on weekends. Reddit consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. Quora displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.Â Tinder, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160. Tumblr followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends. OnlyFans showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends. The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China. Amazon Taobao AliExpress Shopify Temu Alibaba eBay Shein Mercado Libre Wildberries (RU) Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russiaâs âAmazon,âÂ that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada. Looking at how e-commerce sites performed in our Overall ranking, we observed the following trends: Amazon fluctuated between #9 and #10 after October, returning to #9 on November 30 and December 1, during the Black Friday weekend. It often performed better on weekends. Shopifyâs best day of the year was Black Friday, November 29, when it reached #55. The global e-commerce platform performed better during weekdays. Temu, known for low-cost products, started 2024 outside the Top 100 but climbed into the Top 70 by year-end. It performed best in late October and early November, peaking at #63, with a Black Friday spike to #65. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, showed growth, nearing the Top 100 in early 2024 before dropping to the Top 140 between June and October. It rebounded in November, peaking at #83 on Black Friday. A similar trend was observed in 2023, when it ended the year around the Top 120. Hereâs the comparison between recent players Temu and Shein: eBay consistently ranked between #72 and #80, peaking at #62 on October 5-6 and again in late November, just before Black Friday. It often performed better on weekends. Mercado Libre, the Latin American marketplace, had its best day on Black Friday, November 29, reaching #100. Adidas entered the Top 250, ranking #232 on Black Friday, November 29. Target performed well in November, peaking at #133 on November 27, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, and at #127 on December 1. It often performed better on Sundays. Walmart improved its performance from September onward, with its best days on November 25-26, reaching #150. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, peaked at #247 on June 29. The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus. YouTube Netflix Twitch Roku Disney Plus Amazon Prime Video Vimeo Plex.TV Pluto TV Â Bigo Live Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gaming, kept the #3 spot, as it did in 2023 and 2022. Roku, a digital media player that also offers streaming services, ranked #4, maintaining its position from last year. Similarly, Disney Plus (#5) and Amazon Prime Video (#6) held their spots, while Hulu dropped out of the Top 10. The creative video platform Vimeo showed clear popularity growth since May, followed by recent players like Plex TV, a media platform with streaming that performed better starting in October, and Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service that also showed growth throughout the year. Bigo Live, a live-streaming social platform, entered the Top 10 rankings in May.Â Next, the Top 10 overtime perspective: Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023. Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found: Netflix consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays. Disney Plus ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along. Prime Video had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform. HBO/Max was consistently around the Top 100 until August. but dropped out after October. Peacock had an inconsistent presence in the Top 250 but reappeared in late July during the Paris 2024 Olympics, reaching #176 on July 28. That was one of the busiest days for Olympic events, as detailed in our blog post on the event. Paramount Plus was mostly outside the Top 250 this year but peaked at #216 on February 11, the day of the Super Bowl, which the platform streamed. News organizations are vital for keeping the public informed, especially during crises. With that in mind, this ranking of news services, some of which are well-established news outlets while others are news aggregators, also highlights a few newsworthy trends. Globo BBC NY Times CNN Fox News Google News Yahoo Finance Daily Mail RT NewsBreak This yearâs rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant â one of the largest in Latin America and globally â encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages.Â The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN. Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10.Â The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations. The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Hereâs the News ranking: Notable news trends we identified in our larger Overall ranking include: As weâve seen in the News category, the US elections on November 5, 2024, caused CNN, Fox News, and others to jump in our rankings. This trend was also evident in the Overall ranking for the following media outlets, listed by performance. November 6 was the best day of 2024 for each: CNN: #105 on November 5; #72 on November 6 Fox News: #153 on November 5; #92 on November 6 BBC: #115 on November 5, and #97 on November 6 NY Times: #149 on November 5; #98 on November 6 NBC News: #160 on November 6 Associated Press: #166 on November 6 Google News: #250 on November 5; #228 on November 6 Wall Street Journal: #241 on November 6 Washington Post: #245 on November 6 In the next chart we show rankings for CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and NY Times: Brazil made headlines in late February when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters protested to defend the former president against investigations. During this period, Globo moved up the rankings, reaching #60 on February 24-25, 2024. WP, the news aggregator from Poland, had its best day on July 26 (#188), coinciding with Polish lawmakers voting to allow security forces to use lethal weapons with âimpunityâ, particularly at the tense border with Belarus. WP peaked again on November 6 (#180), the day after the US elections, when the result of the election was mentioned in Polandâs parliament. Its third and final peak was on Black Friday, November 29, again at #180. Rambler, the Russian news aggregator, peaked at #218 on February 23, 2024, the day after the Moscow concert hall attack and the same day Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Appleâs iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis. With that in mind, WhatsApp retained its position as the top messaging service in 2024, consistent with 2023 and 2022. WhatsApp QQ Telegram Viber WeChat Signal LINE KakaoTalk eitaa.com Facebook Messenger Following WhatsApp at #2 is, for the second year in a row, the Chinese service QQ, also known as Tencent QQ, which includes games and mobile payments and is popular in Asia. Telegram, widely used in Eastern Europe and Asia, took the #3 spot from Viber in June. Viber remains popular in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. WeChat rose this year, securing #5 in October and surpassing Signal, which held that position for most of the year but dropped to #6 (the same position in which it ended 2023). LINE from Japan ranked #7, while new entries to the Top 10 included South Koreaâs KakaoTalk (#8) and Iranâs eitaa.com (#9), a messaging application, designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, that is popular in Iran and among the Farsi (Persian) language diaspora. Facebook Messenger rounded out the Top 10 at #10. Here are other messaging trends from our Overall ranking: WhatsApp, as noted, performed better this year, growing in popularity since late July, stabilizing at #9 by mid-October, and performing better during weekdays. Telegramâs best days were between July 16-18, during developments in the Ukraine war, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaving Crimea. Telegram is widely used by thousands of Russian âwar correspondents,â as recently reported. Eitaa, the Iranian cloud-based messaging app, peaked at #185 in our Overall ranking on April 14, 2024, the day of Iranian strikes against Israel, which we covered in a blog post on Internet trends. WeChat spiked in our Overall ranking (#116) on July 30, 2024, coinciding with Chinese leaders pledging to tilt stimulus efforts towards consumers. Gaming and metaverse both involve immersing players in other worlds. Leaving concepts aside, weâve grouped gaming and the metaverse into the same category since 2022. Roblox dominated this category again in 2024, retaining its top spot, followed by Microsoftâs Xbox at #2. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, ranked third. Roblox Xbox/Xbox Live Epic Games/Fortnite Steam PlayStation Electronic Arts Blizzard Riot Games/League of Legends Minecraft Garena Xbox/Xbox Live held #2 consistently, but Epic Games/Fortnite contested the position earlier in the year and again in November. Steam was a surprise this year, jumping to #4, ahead of PlayStation. It even rose to #2 in late March and early April, coinciding with the launch of a new demo. Other platforms on the rise included Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and Riot Games/League of Legends. Minecraft made the Top 10 at #9, performing best on July 5, 6, and 10, when it reached #7. Garena, the Singaporean game developer and publisher, entered the Top 10 for the first time. Oculus, Metaâs VR headset and metaverse service, dropped out of the Top 10 to #11, after ending 2023 at #5. It performed better earlier in the year (until April) and in late November. Hereâs the top chart across 2024: Here are other metaverse and gaming trends from our Overall ranking: Robloxâs best day in 2024 was January 21, when it reached #20. The platform performed better on weekends, especially Sundays, similar to other popular gaming platforms like Xbox/Xbox Live, Epic Games/Fortnite, Steam, and PlayStation. Epic Games/Fortniteâs best day was January 1, 2024. Xbox/Xbox Live (#37) and PlayStation (#43) had their best day on November 2, 2024, the day before the launch of the new version of the classic game Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge. Steamâs best day was August 24, 2024, during the week of Gamescom 2024 in Germany. Several new games were released that week, including Tactical Breach Wizards and Dustborn. Minecraft, celebrating its 15th anniversary in May 2024, had its best days on June 15 (#90), following the release of the Tricky Trials game update by Mojang Studios, and August 17 (#90), coinciding with the release of Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot 24w33a. Financial services cover everything from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies and tax tools. Stripe, the Irish-American payment platform, kept its #1 spot for the second year, after overtaking PayPal in this category in 2023. Stripe TradingView Alipay PayPal Nubank (BR) Binance Coinbase Banco do Brasil Bradesco Bank Itau PayPal spent only a few days at #2 and a few others at #3 this year, but ultimately dropped to #4. TradingView, a platform specializing in tools for traders and investors, climbed to #2, followed by AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, which secured #3. Nubank, the Brazilian neobank (only online) and considered to be the most valuable, one of the biggest Latin America financial groups and the world's biggest digital bank, entered the Top 10 at #5, while Binance rose to #6 (up from #8 last year). Binance also peaked at #3 on November 12-13, following the US elections, as Bitcoin reached new highs. In the crypto space, Coinbase joined the Top 10 for the first time. Brazilâs growth in online banking, digital banks, and payments in Latin America has driven traditional banks to expand their digital presence. In 2024, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and ItaÃº performed well and rose into the Top 10, moving more than ever to the online space including in partnership with each other (as detailed in these two (1), (2) articles in Portuguese). And hereâs the crypto perspective in this Financial services category: Next, we highlight other financial services trends from our Overall ranking: Stripeâs best days were just before Black Friday, on November 18-19 and November 25, reaching #81 during those days. Stripe performed better on weekends and maintained consistent rankings throughout the year. PayPal ranked higher around Black Friday week, peaking at #89 on November 21 and on Black Friday, November 29. Brazilian bank Nubank performed best a few days before Carnival in Brazil (February 10-14), reaching #87 on February 1 and 3 and #92 on February 10. It also ranked well on Black Friday, November 29, peaking at #90. In addition to our Financial Services category, we evaluated cryptocurrency-related services specifically. Despite a few crashes over recent years, the crypto sector continued to evolve in 2024, experiencing a late-year boom, as we explore below. Binance and Coinbase retained the top two spots, while OKX climbed to #3 this year. Binance Coinbase OKX 2miners.com CoinMarketCap Coingecko Bybit Exodus Tonkeeper NiceHash CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data platform, dropped to #6, making way for OKX in late August, while new entrant 2miners.com rose to #4. CoinMarketCap ranked #5, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10: Bybit (#7): A cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and derivatives trading. Exodus (#8): A user-friendly, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. Tonkeeper (#9): A secure wallet for managing Toncoin and related assets. NiceHash, a platform connecting cryptocurrency miners and buyers, performed better in 2023, but dropped from #5 to #10 this year. The US elections also had an apparent effect on the Overall ranking: Binance entered the Top 100 for the first time on September 26, when Bitcoin surged past $65,000, driven by positive US employment data and Chinaâs announcement of economic stimulus measures. It peaked at #97 on November 13, following the US elections and Donald Trumpâs victory, as Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time. Coinbaseâs best day was November 21, reaching #131, as Bitcoin approached $100,000 (which it surpassed on December 4, although our ranking only covers up to December 1). OKX peaked at #149 on November 22, and CoinMarketCap reached #176 on November 23. CoinGeckoâs best day was November 11, the week following the US elections, when it climbed to #137. Outside the categories we reviewed as part of the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (July 26âAugust 11, 2024) appeared in our Top 250 Overall ranking, with Olympics-related sites debuting on July 27 (#195), the first full day of events. The peak was on July 30 (#177), driven by LÃ©on Marchandâs swimming performances and the US womenâs artistic gymnastics medal, as detailed in our Olympics blog post. The final day in the Top 250 was August 11 (#217). Spotify ranked between #17 and #18 this year, performing best in October, spending most of the month at #17.

Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAIâs ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides. In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth. Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future. On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates. We welcome your feedback and suggestions for new categories to explore in the Year in Review. (Our data scientist, Sabina Zejnilovic, played a crucial role in gathering the Internet services data.)

Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users' needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflareâs observations and a review of the yearâs DNS trends. Building on similar reports weâve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on: Generative AI Social Media Ecommerce Video Streaming News Messaging Metaverse & Gaming Financial Services Cryptocurrency Services As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesnât always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service â it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank. This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News. This year, weâre also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore. Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics. Since 2021, weâve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Googleâs top spot. Itâs important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains. Google Facebook Apple TikTok Amazon Web Services Microsoft Instagram YouTube Amazon WhatsApp Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year. Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube. Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot. Close to the Top 10 were Appleâs iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoftâs Outlook. In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year. In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on Xâs performance in the Social Media category below. Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023. ChatGPT (OpenAI) Character.AI Codeium QuillBot Claude (Anthropic) Perplexity GitHub Copilot Wordtune Poe Tabnine Significant changes occurred below ChatGPTâs first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool. Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6. This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year. Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October â in November, it ranked #6 on weekends. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends. Google Gemini, Googleâs AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September. Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAIâs announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API. Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include: ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends. Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT. Codeium entered the top 300 in July. It ranked higher on weekdays than weekends. According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention. Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall. Facebook TikTok Instagram X Snapchat LinkedIn Discord Kwai Pinterest Reddit In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October. LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Hereâs the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024: Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November. The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Hereâs a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category: Letâs move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident. As weâve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didnât break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends. Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220.Â Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. Itâs worth noting that Threads also uses Instagramâs cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasnât impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings). Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking: Instagramâs best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey. Xâs best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted Xâs ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics. X performed better on weekdays, while LinkedIn ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. Snapchat and Discord performed better on weekends. Reddit consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. Quora displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.Â Tinder, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160. Tumblr followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends. OnlyFans showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends. The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China. Amazon Taobao AliExpress Shopify Temu Alibaba eBay Shein Mercado Libre Wildberries (RU) Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russiaâs âAmazon,âÂ that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada. Looking at how e-commerce sites performed in our Overall ranking, we observed the following trends: Amazon fluctuated between #9 and #10 after October, returning to #9 on November 30 and December 1, during the Black Friday weekend. It often performed better on weekends. Shopifyâs best day of the year was Black Friday, November 29, when it reached #55. The global e-commerce platform performed better during weekdays. Temu, known for low-cost products, started 2024 outside the Top 100 but climbed into the Top 70 by year-end. It performed best in late October and early November, peaking at #63, with a Black Friday spike to #65. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, showed growth, nearing the Top 100 in early 2024 before dropping to the Top 140 between June and October. It rebounded in November, peaking at #83 on Black Friday. A similar trend was observed in 2023, when it ended the year around the Top 120. Hereâs the comparison between recent players Temu and Shein: eBay consistently ranked between #72 and #80, peaking at #62 on October 5-6 and again in late November, just before Black Friday. It often performed better on weekends. Mercado Libre, the Latin American marketplace, had its best day on Black Friday, November 29, reaching #100. Adidas entered the Top 250, ranking #232 on Black Friday, November 29. Target performed well in November, peaking at #133 on November 27, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, and at #127 on December 1. It often performed better on Sundays. Walmart improved its performance from September onward, with its best days on November 25-26, reaching #150. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, peaked at #247 on June 29. The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus. YouTube Netflix Twitch Roku Disney Plus Amazon Prime Video Vimeo Plex.TV Pluto TV Â Bigo Live Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gaming, kept the #3 spot, as it did in 2023 and 2022. Roku, a digital media player that also offers streaming services, ranked #4, maintaining its position from last year. Similarly, Disney Plus (#5) and Amazon Prime Video (#6) held their spots, while Hulu dropped out of the Top 10. The creative video platform Vimeo showed clear popularity growth since May, followed by recent players like Plex TV, a media platform with streaming that performed better starting in October, and Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service that also showed growth throughout the year. Bigo Live, a live-streaming social platform, entered the Top 10 rankings in May.Â Next, the Top 10 overtime perspective: Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023. Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found: Netflix consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays. Disney Plus ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along. Prime Video had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform. HBO/Max was consistently around the Top 100 until August. but dropped out after October. Peacock had an inconsistent presence in the Top 250 but reappeared in late July during the Paris 2024 Olympics, reaching #176 on July 28. That was one of the busiest days for Olympic events, as detailed in our blog post on the event. Paramount Plus was mostly outside the Top 250 this year but peaked at #216 on February 11, the day of the Super Bowl, which the platform streamed. News organizations are vital for keeping the public informed, especially during crises. With that in mind, this ranking of news services, some of which are well-established news outlets while others are news aggregators, also highlights a few newsworthy trends. Globo BBC NY Times CNN Fox News Google News Yahoo Finance Daily Mail RT NewsBreak This yearâs rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant â one of the largest in Latin America and globally â encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages.Â The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN. Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10.Â The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations. The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Hereâs the News ranking: Notable news trends we identified in our larger Overall ranking include: As weâve seen in the News category, the US elections on November 5, 2024, caused CNN, Fox News, and others to jump in our rankings. This trend was also evident in the Overall ranking for the following media outlets, listed by performance. November 6 was the best day of 2024 for each: CNN: #105 on November 5; #72 on November 6 Fox News: #153 on November 5; #92 on November 6 BBC: #115 on November 5, and #97 on November 6 NY Times: #149 on November 5; #98 on November 6 NBC News: #160 on November 6 Associated Press: #166 on November 6 Google News: #250 on November 5; #228 on November 6 Wall Street Journal: #241 on November 6 Washington Post: #245 on November 6 In the next chart we show rankings for CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and NY Times: Brazil made headlines in late February when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters protested to defend the former president against investigations. During this period, Globo moved up the rankings, reaching #60 on February 24-25, 2024. WP, the news aggregator from Poland, had its best day on July 26 (#188), coinciding with Polish lawmakers voting to allow security forces to use lethal weapons with âimpunityâ, particularly at the tense border with Belarus. WP peaked again on November 6 (#180), the day after the US elections, when the result of the election was mentioned in Polandâs parliament. Its third and final peak was on Black Friday, November 29, again at #180. Rambler, the Russian news aggregator, peaked at #218 on February 23, 2024, the day after the Moscow concert hall attack and the same day Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Appleâs iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis. With that in mind, WhatsApp retained its position as the top messaging service in 2024, consistent with 2023 and 2022. WhatsApp QQ Telegram Viber WeChat Signal LINE KakaoTalk eitaa.com Facebook Messenger Following WhatsApp at #2 is, for the second year in a row, the Chinese service QQ, also known as Tencent QQ, which includes games and mobile payments and is popular in Asia. Telegram, widely used in Eastern Europe and Asia, took the #3 spot from Viber in June. Viber remains popular in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. WeChat rose this year, securing #5 in October and surpassing Signal, which held that position for most of the year but dropped to #6 (the same position in which it ended 2023). LINE from Japan ranked #7, while new entries to the Top 10 included South Koreaâs KakaoTalk (#8) and Iranâs eitaa.com (#9), a messaging application, designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, that is popular in Iran and among the Farsi (Persian) language diaspora. Facebook Messenger rounded out the Top 10 at #10. Here are other messaging trends from our Overall ranking: WhatsApp, as noted, performed better this year, growing in popularity since late July, stabilizing at #9 by mid-October, and performing better during weekdays. Telegramâs best days were between July 16-18, during developments in the Ukraine war, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaving Crimea. Telegram is widely used by thousands of Russian âwar correspondents,â as recently reported. Eitaa, the Iranian cloud-based messaging app, peaked at #185 in our Overall ranking on April 14, 2024, the day of Iranian strikes against Israel, which we covered in a blog post on Internet trends. WeChat spiked in our Overall ranking (#116) on July 30, 2024, coinciding with Chinese leaders pledging to tilt stimulus efforts towards consumers. Gaming and metaverse both involve immersing players in other worlds. Leaving concepts aside, weâve grouped gaming and the metaverse into the same category since 2022. Roblox dominated this category again in 2024, retaining its top spot, followed by Microsoftâs Xbox at #2. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, ranked third. Roblox Xbox/Xbox Live Epic Games/Fortnite Steam PlayStation Electronic Arts Blizzard Riot Games/League of Legends Minecraft Garena Xbox/Xbox Live held #2 consistently, but Epic Games/Fortnite contested the position earlier in the year and again in November. Steam was a surprise this year, jumping to #4, ahead of PlayStation. It even rose to #2 in late March and early April, coinciding with the launch of a new demo. Other platforms on the rise included Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and Riot Games/League of Legends. Minecraft made the Top 10 at #9, performing best on July 5, 6, and 10, when it reached #7. Garena, the Singaporean game developer and publisher, entered the Top 10 for the first time. Oculus, Metaâs VR headset and metaverse service, dropped out of the Top 10 to #11, after ending 2023 at #5. It performed better earlier in the year (until April) and in late November. Hereâs the top chart across 2024: Here are other metaverse and gaming trends from our Overall ranking: Robloxâs best day in 2024 was January 21, when it reached #20. The platform performed better on weekends, especially Sundays, similar to other popular gaming platforms like Xbox/Xbox Live, Epic Games/Fortnite, Steam, and PlayStation. Epic Games/Fortniteâs best day was January 1, 2024. Xbox/Xbox Live (#37) and PlayStation (#43) had their best day on November 2, 2024, the day before the launch of the new version of the classic game Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge. Steamâs best day was August 24, 2024, during the week of Gamescom 2024 in Germany. Several new games were released that week, including Tactical Breach Wizards and Dustborn. Minecraft, celebrating its 15th anniversary in May 2024, had its best days on June 15 (#90), following the release of the Tricky Trials game update by Mojang Studios, and August 17 (#90), coinciding with the release of Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot 24w33a. Financial services cover everything from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies and tax tools. Stripe, the Irish-American payment platform, kept its #1 spot for the second year, after overtaking PayPal in this category in 2023. Stripe TradingView Alipay PayPal Nubank (BR) Binance Coinbase Banco do Brasil Bradesco Bank Itau PayPal spent only a few days at #2 and a few others at #3 this year, but ultimately dropped to #4. TradingView, a platform specializing in tools for traders and investors, climbed to #2, followed by AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, which secured #3. Nubank, the Brazilian neobank (only online) and considered to be the most valuable, one of the biggest Latin America financial groups and the world's biggest digital bank, entered the Top 10 at #5, while Binance rose to #6 (up from #8 last year). Binance also peaked at #3 on November 12-13, following the US elections, as Bitcoin reached new highs. In the crypto space, Coinbase joined the Top 10 for the first time. Brazilâs growth in online banking, digital banks, and payments in Latin America has driven traditional banks to expand their digital presence. In 2024, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and ItaÃº performed well and rose into the Top 10, moving more than ever to the online space including in partnership with each other (as detailed in these two (1), (2) articles in Portuguese). And hereâs the crypto perspective in this Financial services category: Next, we highlight other financial services trends from our Overall ranking: Stripeâs best days were just before Black Friday, on November 18-19 and November 25, reaching #81 during those days. Stripe performed better on weekends and maintained consistent rankings throughout the year. PayPal ranked higher around Black Friday week, peaking at #89 on November 21 and on Black Friday, November 29. Brazilian bank Nubank performed best a few days before Carnival in Brazil (February 10-14), reaching #87 on February 1 and 3 and #92 on February 10. It also ranked well on Black Friday, November 29, peaking at #90. In addition to our Financial Services category, we evaluated cryptocurrency-related services specifically. Despite a few crashes over recent years, the crypto sector continued to evolve in 2024, experiencing a late-year boom, as we explore below. Binance and Coinbase retained the top two spots, while OKX climbed to #3 this year. Binance Coinbase OKX 2miners.com CoinMarketCap Coingecko Bybit Exodus Tonkeeper NiceHash CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data platform, dropped to #6, making way for OKX in late August, while new entrant 2miners.com rose to #4. CoinMarketCap ranked #5, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10: Bybit (#7): A cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and derivatives trading. Exodus (#8): A user-friendly, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. Tonkeeper (#9): A secure wallet for managing Toncoin and related assets. NiceHash, a platform connecting cryptocurrency miners and buyers, performed better in 2023, but dropped from #5 to #10 this year. The US elections also had an apparent effect on the Overall ranking: Binance entered the Top 100 for the first time on September 26, when Bitcoin surged past $65,000, driven by positive US employment data and Chinaâs announcement of economic stimulus measures. It peaked at #97 on November 13, following the US elections and Donald Trumpâs victory, as Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time. Coinbaseâs best day was November 21, reaching #131, as Bitcoin approached $100,000 (which it surpassed on December 4, although our ranking only covers up to December 1). OKX peaked at #149 on November 22, and CoinMarketCap reached #176 on November 23. CoinGeckoâs best day was November 11, the week following the US elections, when it climbed to #137. Outside the categories we reviewed as part of the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (July 26âAugust 11, 2024) appeared in our Top 250 Overall ranking, with Olympics-related sites debuting on July 27 (#195), the first full day of events. The peak was on July 30 (#177), driven by LÃ©on Marchandâs swimming performances and the US womenâs artistic gymnastics medal, as detailed in our Olympics blog post. The final day in the Top 250 was August 11 (#217). Spotify ranked between #17 and #18 this year, performing best in October, spending most of the month at #17. However, as our list ends on December 1, we are not tracking the impact of the recently launched Spotify Wrapped. Tesla entered the Top 250 after October. Its best day was October 12 (#245), following the Cybercab robotaxi reveal. It also ranked higher on November 17 (#246), after a post-US elections stock rally. GitHubâs best day was November 8 (#31), coinciding with its announcement of enhanced security protocols, including mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for organizations. NBA appeared in the Top 250 until early March, with its best day on February 4, during these games. Nike ranked only once, on March 26 (#236), during the annual Air Max Day celebration. Brazilâs official Judiciary site peaked at #105 on October 6, during the first round of municipal elections. Ticketmaster peaked at #169 on October 8, during a major service disruption, followed by October 9 (#170), the day Australian F1 tickets went on sale. Intuitâs best day was April 15 (#121), US Tax Day, consistent with previous years. Weather.com peaked at #61 between August 4â6, during Hurricane Debbyâs landfall in Florida. The best day for IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) was January 1 (#220). Example.com, a domain used for documentation purposes, ranked between #24 and #56. Regarding our newly country/region-specific Popular Internet Services overall lists (available on the Year in Review microsite), we observed that Google ranked #1 in nearly all countries. However, there are other notable highlights we feel are worth sharing: TikTok was ranked #1 in Iraq, Kosovo, and Libya, and #2 in over 30 countries/regions across different continents. Examples include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Belarus, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Palestine, Ukraine, Venezuela, and South Africa. Facebook was #1 in Myanmar and #2 in 69 other countries. Myanmar, where the government is known to block several websites, fell to the bottom of Freedom Houseâs Internet freedom ranking this year. Instagram performed well in several countries, ranking among the top five in 18 countries/regions. X showed strong performance in Japan, where it is widely known, ranking #3 in 2024. It also ranked within the top 10 in 23 countries/regions. Reddit did not make the Top 10 in any country but performed best in Iceland (#26) and the United States (#28). Kwai, the social media platform, performed best in Brazil, ranking #7 overall. Snapchat performed well in Iraq and Kosovo (#4) and in Libya, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia (#5). ChatGPT did not reach the Top 10 in any country but made it into the Top 50 in 47 countries. It performed best in Singapore (#35), Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka (#36), Switzerland, Taiwan (#37), Ethiopia (#38), Japan, Iceland, and Haiti (#40). YouTube ranked in the Top 10 in 113 countries/regions, and reached the Top 5 in countries like Bangladesh (#4), and Armenia, Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Peru, Qatar, Ukraine, and Uganda (#5). Netflix made the Top 10 in 17 countries/regions, performing best in Colombia and Ecuador (#8) and in Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Trinidad and Tobago (#9). WhatsApp made the Top 10 in 90 countries/regions and ranked in the Top 5 in over 35, reaching #4 in regions such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, including Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Indonesia, Laos, Peru, Pakistan, Paraguay, Uganda, and Venezuela. LINE, the messaging app by Naver, made the Top 10 in Thailand (#8). Viber, the messaging service, ranked in the Top 10 in Myanmar (#5), Ukraine (#9), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (#10). Zalo.me, the Vietnamese multi-platform messaging app, ranked #6 in Vietnam. Yandex, the Russian search engine and portal, ranked highest in Belarus and Russia (#3), as well as in Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Uzbekistan (#5). Yahoo appeared only in Japanâs Top 10. Temu, which showed notable growth in 2024, did not feature in the Top 10 in any country/region, but placed in the Top 30 in Oman (#18), Bahrain (#25), Kuwait (#26), the Dominican Republic, and Qatar (#27). Roblox appeared in the Top 10 in only three countries/regions: Philippines (#7), Kosovo (#8), and Trinidad and Tobago (#10). Wikipedia reached the #10 spot in Bangladesh and Ukraine. Microsoft Office 365 performed best in Europe, ranking #4 in Slovenia, #5 in Portugal, and #6 in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. Microsoft Outlook showed strong performance in Australia (#7), Denmark, New Zealand, and Slovenia (#8). Naver, the South Korean platform and search engine, ranked #4 in South Korea. The Internet continues to shape how we socialize, work, and stay informed. Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAIâs ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides. In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth. Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future. On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved lower Monday after China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it is investigating the chipmaking giant for potential violations of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The antitrust regulator said Monday that it is looking into Nvidia over the chipmaker's 2020 acquisition of Israeli-American networking hardware maker Mellanox Technologies. SAMR said it "is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law," according to a translation from CNBC. In a statement provided to Investopedia, a company spokesperson wrote, "NVIDIA wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The $6.9 billion deal was announced in March 2019 and completed in April 2020, days after the same Chinese regulators signed off on the deal along with regulators in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Approval for the deal came with the conditions from Chinese regulators that Nvidia wouldn't discriminate against its companies and that Mellanox informed competitors of new products within 90 days of providing them to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Shares of the chipmaker that have surged thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom were down about 2% Monday afternoon to $139.61, but still have risen more than 180% since the start of the year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with a statement from Nvidia, additional information, and the latest share price movements.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are America's best-managed companies right now, report says

Time Published: 2024-12-09T13:24:00Z
Full Content:
Apple (AAPL-0.59%) is the best-managed company in the U.S., according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal. Of 250 companies, Nvidia (NVDA-2.72%) came in second, followed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), Intel (INTC-1.92%), and Mastercard (MA-0.08%) to round out this year’s top five. The ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute, measures the effectiveness of corporate management using five areas: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength. This year, Apple and Nvidia knocked Microsoft out of the top spot — a position it has held for the last four years. Apple ranked highly for innovation and financial strength. Nvidia also ranked first for financial strength and second in employee engagement. The two companies have competed neck and neck to be the world’s most valuable company. Apple currently has a $3.67 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia is worth $3.49 trillion as of market close Friday. Shares of the chipmaker, which has seen a massive boost from artificial intelligence as demand for its AI chips booms, are up almost 200% this year. That’s compared with 30% for Apple. Microsoft has also seen healthy growth this year, adding almost 20% to its share value for a $3.30 trillion market cap. The company also ranked near the top in innovation and financial strength. Intel, on the other hand, has had a rocky year. Ranked as the fourth best-managed company in the country, Intel ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger last week after he failed to turn around the company’s performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA-0.77%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. Nonetheless, Intel ranked first across all 250 companies in social responsibility, and second in customer satisfaction.

Nvidia (NVDA-2.72%) is under investigation for allegedly violating anti-monopoly laws in China. The country’s State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a probe into whether Nvidia’s acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies violated anti-monopoly laws, according to a report from China Central Television on Monday. Shares of Nvidia fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading on Monday. The leading artificial intelligence chipmaker bought Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2020 after receiving conditional approval from Chinese authorities. Conditions included requirements that Nvidia and Mellanox not bundle or tie together products, continue to supply on fair terms, and ensure that chips from Chinese manufacturers worked with the technology. Other requirements were aimed at maintaining independence between the two firms, and lessening any potential impacts of export controls amid the trade war between the U.S. and China that began in 2018 under the first Trump administration. This comes as chip trade tensions between the two economic superpowers continue to escalate. Last week, the Department of Commerce introduced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said.d Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were added to the U.S. trade blacklist. According to the agency, the curbs are aimed at slowing China’s advanced AI developments that have “the potential to change the future of warfare” and “impairing” China’s development of its chip ecosystem. Last month, the U.S. reportedly asked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+3.80%), the world’s largest chipmaker, to stop sending its advanced AI chips to China. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: China is probing Nvidia in a major escalation of its chip wars with the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has opened an antitrust investigation into American chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power artificial intelligence, according to Chinese state media. The probe serves as the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance, which both the United States and China believe is crucial for national security. China Central Television in a report Monday said the Chinese government believes Nvidia’s purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox could violate the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though the report did not specify what the merger did to potentially break the law. China approved the acquisition in 2020. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell less than 2% in premarket trading Monday. The stock is among the hottest on the market, surging nearly 200% this year as the AI boom has fueled demand for the company’s chips. Its market value is more than $3 trillion, second only to Apple. The tit-for-tat China-US chip war has entered a new phase this month, after the Biden administration imposed another round of restrictions on high tech memory chip sales to China a week ago. The memory chips are different than the graphics processors Nvidia makes, but they are also crucial technology that helps power AI. The administration’s new export controls are the third such round of chip sales restrictions to China. The United States fears that China could use AI to gain a military advantage, and US Commerce Department officials said they believed the restrictions would slow China’s development of AI chips — and industry experts believe the US government’s plan will work. But China’s Commerce Ministry lambasted the United States’ restrictions, saying they pose “a significant threat” to the stability of global supply chains. China’s government retaliated last week by banning the sale of materials essential for manufacturing the chips, including germanium and gallium. A year ago, China had curbed the sale of those materials but created loopholes that allowed for some sales to continue. Those have now been closed. Senior US officials have also accused China of stealing American-made AI software, which Beijing denies. The Nvidia investigation ups the ante. The company is the face of the AI tech revolution and hurting Nvidia could harm the American company’s ambitions to continue to power AI around the world. Nvidia is also under antitrust scrutiny in the United States, according to Bloomberg. In addition to curbing materials and chips sales, both China and the United States are trying to bolster their own development and manufacturing of microprocessors at home. Through the CHIPS Act, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars into Intel and other companies to boost domestic production of chips and reduce America’s reliance on China and other foreign countries for the technology. Meanwhile, China in May announced plans to set up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund worth $47.5 billion, funded by investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end.

Title: China investigates Nvidia over suspected violation of antimonopoly law

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh BEIJING (Reuters) -China said on Monday it has launched an investigation into Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. The statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation announcing the probe did not elaborate on how the U.S. company, known for its artificial intelligence and gaming chips, might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. It said the U.S. chipmaker was also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, under terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. The announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running trade war between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological superiority. Last week, four of China's top industry associations issued a rare and coordinated response saying that Chinese companies should be wary of buying U.S. chips as they were "no longer safe" and should buy locally instead. Nvidia's shares closed 2.5% lower on Monday. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company worked hard to "provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," adding that "we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business". TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Reuters that the probe is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidia’s most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Shortly after Washington's announcement, Beijing banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. Nvidia is one of many companies caught up in U.S.-China friction. U.S. sanctions in 2022 banned shipments of A100 and H100 AI chips to China, leading Nvidia to develop modified versions. These China-specific variants were later restricted under tightened U.S. controls in October 2023, prompting Nvidia to release another set of modified chips for the Chinese market. "It's clear that the Chinese government is trying to react against recent restrictions from the U.S., but their ability to impact the U.S. semiconductor industry continues to decrease over time," O'Donnell said. Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with a more than 90% share before those curbs. However, it faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. China accounted for around 17% of Nvidia's revenue in the year to the end of January, sliding from 26% two years earlier. In 2020, the company won a key approval from China for its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, to the relief of investors who felt Sino-U.S. trade friction could complicate the process. Nvidia and the merged entity were set multiple conditions, requiring them to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" terms. The companies must also provide customers and distributors the opportunity to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The conditions also prohibit forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately. The last time China launched an anti-monopoly probe into a high-profile foreign technology firm was in 2013, when it investigated Qualcomm's local subsidiary for overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm later agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, which was the largest China had ever handed out to a company at the time.

A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year.

This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting.

December 09, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from a single and remarkably high-grade diamond drill hole recently completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-347 was a shallow hole drilled at the eastern margin of the historic O’Brien Gold Mine workings. At approximately 200 metres vertical depth it intersected 643.1 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold (“Au”) over 2.1 metres, including 1,345.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. The extensive nuggety-gold and high silicification suggest that the hole has intersected the near-surface extension of the famous O’Brien “Jewellery Box”, a mining stope believed to be the source of extremely high-grade and museum quality gold samples. Video of the core is available HERE. Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “When the O’Brien Gold Mine was operational between 1926 and 1957, it was known for very high grades and spectacular specimens of visible gold, many of which are now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. The source of some of the best specimens was thought to be the Jewellery Box stope, a narrow, vertical grade-shoot extending from 250 metres depth to at least 750 metres depth. At the time, exploration drifts were developed to try to find this zone above the 250 metres level, without success. Now, drill-hole OB-24-347 has intersected what we believe is the same Jewellery Box zone marginally offset to the east. We intend to now trace it to the surface with additional drilling and expose it with stripping. This is being planned for our 2025 exploration program. Steeply plunging high-grade shoots are characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The Jewellery Box Stope was always the best of these. Its potential re-discovery offers very high value, low-hanging fruit for a future O’Brien mine.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-347Matt Manson continued: “Our 2024 drill program of 35,000 metres has comprised a combination of shallower holes, such as with today’s news, and deeper holes exploring the full depth potential of O’Brien gold mineralization. Of note, we have recently completed drill hole OB-24-337, the first hole ever drilled directly below the historic mine and, at 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project. The results from this hole are expected to be released shortly.” Figure 2: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with the Location of OB-24-347 Illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Figure 3: More Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB 24-347. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-347 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, United ... [+] Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has gained about 48% year-to-date, compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. JPMorgan’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 50% YTD. Let’s take a look at JPM’s recent performance and outlook. As an aside, see What’s The Outlook For U.S. Bancorp Stock? JPMorgan outperformed street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported total revenues of $42.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. Net interest income was slightly higher compared to last year, due to changes in the balance sheet mix, higher credit card balances, as well as wholesale deposits. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Non-interest revenue, excluding the markets segment, grew by a strong 17% led by higher asset management fees as well as an improved investment banking performance. However, net income was down by about 2% compared to last year at $12.9 billion on account of higher provisions for credit losses. As an aside, why is VALE down 40% this year? See What’s Happening With VALE Stock? Admirably, JPM stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 31% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s the outlook like for JPMorgan? Separately, see why Citi stock is also having a good year in Why Citi Stock Is Up 40% This Year. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as JPMorgan. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. While JPMorgan remains one of the highest quality names in the banking space, with considerable scale, we believe the stock is overvalued. JPM stock trades at over 2.5x tangible book value (company’s net assets, less goodwill) which is elevated in our view. Overall, at its current price of $245 per share, JPM is trading about 15% ahead of Trefis’ estimate for JPMorgan’s valuation.

Title: Computer science grads say the job market is rough. Some are opting for a 'panic' master's degree instead.

A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

Title: Life after Google: 8 laid-off employees reflect on being let go, what they did next, and their advice for others

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/will-amazon-buy-bitcoin-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: What We Got Right And Wrong In Our 2024 AI Predictions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2024/12/08/what-we-got-right-and-wrong-in-our-2024-ai-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-12-08T23:00:14Z
Full Content:
We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend. Last week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster Fox News that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines “We need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that”. Trump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has “clarity” to empower the crypto industry to “thrive”. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship”. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy. Musk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren’t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk’s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk “deeply” knows artificial intelligence. The growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world’s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed “Project Rainer,” will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic’s current most advanced model. As reported by WIRED, the announcement was made at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world’s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in AI-driven endpoint and cloud workload protection. On December 6th, the company announced that it has been named a Leader in the 2024 Frost Radar™: Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) for the third consecutive year. The leader in cloud security offers a single, unified platform, known as CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security which empowers customers to stop cloud breaches across every area of enterprise cloud risk and secure workloads. Recognizing this approach, Frost & Sullivan highlighted that “CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security delivers excellent capabilities to address modern cloud security challenges,” with broad coverage across cloud-native and Windows-based environments. It also said that the Falcon platform “offers advanced runtime protection, CDR, extensive platform support, and seamless integration with its XDR and MDR services, making it a leading choice for organizations seeking real-time cloud threat management.” “Adversaries are evolving faster than ever, exploiting the gaps created by tools marketed as CNAPPs that only scratch the surface with basic CSPM or vulnerability management. CrowdStrike’s recognition as a Leader in the Frost CNAPP Radar for the third consecutive year validates our ability to deliver a comprehensive solution that doesn’t just identify risks—it actually stops breaches. Falcon Cloud Security empowers organizations to close critical gaps, outpace threats, and scale their security for the future on a single, unified platform”. Overall, CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What is high bandwidth memory and why is the US trying to block China’s access to it? | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China. The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

This was in sharp contrast to their net outflows of ₹21,612 crore in November 2024 and massive net withdrawal of ₹94,017 crore recorded in October 2024. Prior to the latest turnaround, FPIs had remained net sellers for eight consecutive weeks. In September, FPIs had bought Indian equities worth ₹57,724 crore. The robust buying was prompted by BJP-led combine making a strong comeback in Maharashtra and US equity benchmarks clocking new all time highs. Taking the latest robust December inflows into account, FPIs have so far this calendar year pumped in ₹9,435 crore in India as compared to net outflows of ₹15,019 crore at the end of November, depositories data showed. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said that FPIs turning buyers in early December, in total reversal of their sustained selling strategy during the last two months, has altered the market sentiments. “In December, through 6th, FPIs have turned buyers having bought equity for ₹17,921 crores through exchanges. Including the purchases through the primary market, the total FPIs buying through December 6th stood at ₹24,453 crores”, he said. This is a clear change in FPI strategy in India. “It can be argued that the stage of relentless FPI selling is over”, Vijayakumar added. Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said “Looking ahead, the flow of foreign investments into Indian equity markets will hinge on several key factors. These include the policies implemented under Donald Trump’s presidency, the prevailing inflation and interest rate environment, and the evolving geopolitical landscape”. Additionally, the third-quarter earnings performance of Indian companies and the country’s progress on the economic growth front will play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and influencing foreign inflows, he said. Srivastava said there could be few probable reasons for this sharp u-turn by FPIs towards Indian equities in December after selling around $14 billion between October and November. The recent correction in the market could have prompted them to build some exposure. Uncertainty over Chinese equities on the back of proposed tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump on China and other several nations could have prompted FPIs to look back at Indian equities which offers a much clearer long term growth prospects, despite relatively high valuations, he said. Additionally, FPIs might have decided to rejig their portfolios a bit towards India given suboptimal GDP number would have fanned hopes that RBI might soon have to start cutting rates to boost the economy, which in turn might boost the equity markets. For the uninitiated, in its recent monetary policy review on December 6, 2024, RBI had cut CRR by 50 bps to 4 per cent, while keeping repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, he noted.
