Title: Clontarf beat Ballynahinch to stretch lead at top of AIL

Clontarf extended their lead atop Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League to five points with a hard-earned and significant 24-20 win away to Ballynahinch. It was the kind of sleeves-rolled-up, midwinter victory that is the trademark of the reigning champions. Clontarf thus completed the double over Ballynahinch, backing up their first Bateman Cup triumph against the same opponents last month. On a day when the Ballymena-Dungannon derby an hour up the road was postponed due to a frozen pitch, frost meant doubt about the fixture at Ballymacarn Park persisted until 11am, when the pitch was declared playable. Clontarf led 12-6 at half-time through tries by Alex O’Grady and Fionn Gilbert, before Ballynahinch were on the verge of a first win over Clontarf since 2020 thanks to a try by Ryan Connolly and a penalty try, as well as eight points from the boot of Conor Rankin. Despite being down to 13 men, Clontarf turned down a kick at goal and were rewarded with a fourth try by Leinster academy lock Alan Spicer, capping a stormer. Conor Kelly converted. St Mary’s had assumed leadership overnight after gaining revenge for their 14-0 loss to Lansdowne four weeks ago with an equally hard-fought 13-7 win on the Aviva back pitch on Friday night. Returning again to his former club, Mark McHugh’s gritty side restricted Lansdowne to just a penalty try in the first-half. Mick McCormack’s close-range finish rewarded concerted pressure and Mick O’Gara’s second penalty helped keep the home side at arm’s length despite Lansdowne’s late rally. In the absence of JJ Kenny, on Leinster try-scoring duty against La Rochelle, Terenure turned to another ex-Irish Sevens winger in Ed Kelly. He duly scored the first try as Terenure gained a 27-19 revenge win over Old Belvedere in an entertaining game that was moved to the Lakelands Park astro pitch. After Will Hickey added another for a 17-0 interval lead, Old Belvedere stayed in touch through two tries by full-back Morgan Meredith either side of Chris Cosgrave becoming a third former St Michael’s pupil to score for Terenure. Before a consolation try for Belvo in the last play, Harrison Brewer powered over off a lineout to complete a bonus-point win that elevated ‘Nure to third in the table on 32 points, five points behind neighbours St Mary’s. Cork Con also moved one point above Lansdowne and into the top four on 32 points by completing a double at home to UCD with a 26-7 bonus-point win; Michael Foy, Sean Condon, Danny Sheahan and Peter Hyland scored their tries. Four weeks after losing 57-10 in Tom Clifford Park, Nenagh Ormond were vastly more competitive at home to Young Munster. Although they lost 43-31, Nenagh finally picked up their first point in the top flight thanks to two tries by number eight Willie Coffey and one each by half-backs Luke Kerr and Charlie O’Doherty, who also kicked 11 points. But Young Munster are now accumulating the wins that their expansive rugby has deserved and they picked up their seventh attacking bonus point through tries by Oran O’Reilly, Luke McCready, Ajae Hanson, Stephen McLoughlin, Oisin Pepper and Jake O’Riordan.

Title: ‘I want to do something to give back’ – Young man cycling from Cork to Mount Everest to raise money for children’s wards

Daragh Cronin said he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive ‘best-in-class paediatric care’ (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) A young man riding a bike from Ireland to Mount Everest has said he is doing it to “give back” to the Cork community which has supported him in the past. Daragh Cronin is hoping his mammoth journey will raise €30,000 for children’s wards at Cork University Hospital (CUH). Mr Cronin said the charity was close to his heart and that he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive “best-in-class paediatric care”. He also wanted to inspire children of the region to “chase their dreams”. Daragh Cronin outside Cork University Hospital (Brian Lougheed/PA) Mr Cronin’s journey will begin at Blackrock hurling club on February 14 and take him on a ferry from Rosslare to France, then trekking out over Europe and the Middle East before heading to Everest base camp. The 23-year-old Cork man is no stranger to long-distance bike journeys, having navigated the length of Africa by riding almost 13,500km between Morocco and South Africa “with zero prior cycling or camping experience”. He said that experience had inspired him to raise money for the hospital, through the CUH Charity. He said he had been told his Africa trip would be “impossible” without experience. “I had guns pointed in my face. But 99pc of the time, there was genuine hospitality and huge amounts of kindness,” he said. Daragh Cronin is from Blackrock in Cork (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) “I know these things are coming my way again but I trust my instinct, I was able to talk my way out of some hairy situations in Africa.” Now, with his trip to Everest, he said: “This time I want to do it for a cause. “I had crazy support when I went to Africa, half of Cork had my back, so I want to do something to give back this time.” The route will see him cross the tip of Oman, through Pakistan, India and Nepal before he reaches Mount Everest. “The record I’m trying to set is to hike the bike from a place called Lukla (in Koshi Province) to Everest base camp, and no Irish person has done that,” he said. “I will cycle as far as I can through Nepal, on to Lukla, and then put the bike over my neck and get to base camp.” – Mr Cronin’s charity fundraiser is available at here.

Title: Binance’s CZ Claims US Banks Are “Loading Up” on Bitcoin While Retail Panics—But Is It Really a Buying Spree?

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has tweeted that major US banks are “loading up” on Bitcoin while the rest of the market has engaged in panic selling. Zhao, fresh from his pardon from US President Trump, has become a much more vocal proponent of the cryptocurrency revolution and is visiting countries around the world to promote it. CZ tweeted: CZ’s tweet is highlighting the latest trend of major American banks buying up Bitcoin in large amounts, even as retail investors continue to be on the defensive. Notable names like BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Barclays, and Standard Chartered have reportedly invested directly. Other financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo have engaged indirectly through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Adding to Wells Fargo’s $383 million purchase of BTC, Morgan Stanley has invested $270 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while JPMorgan Chase holds millions of dollars in multiple Bitcoin ETFs. Goldman Sachs reportedly has a sizeable $1.3 billion stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and $300 million in Fidelity’s ETF. While CZ is doing his best to amplify the recent Wells Fargo purchase, it is not yet true that the US banks are going on a Bitcoin buying spree. The premier digital currency has had a bearish 2025 overall, while other commodities like Gold, Silver, etc., have had a much better showing, outperforming it by a considerable margin. The total investment by US banks in BTC is in the range of several billion dollars, and while that sum may seem huge, it is peanuts compared to their total worth, which is in the tens of trillions of dollars. BlackRock alone is worth in excess of $10 trillion, and its BTC exposure is a minuscule fraction of that valuation. However, the idea that these top banking institutions will be interested in loading up their coffers with BTC in the near future is a likely possibility, as several top executives have voiced their support for it. If these major institutions start holding crypto as a reserve asset, other companies are expected to follow suit, which will likely set off a snowball effect that sharply drives up the crypto market. In addition to major financial players, governments around the world are also looking to buy Bitcoin for their strategic crypto reserves. Several US states, such as Texas and New Hampshire, have already bought BTC for their state coffers, and the US federal government is also moving toward this move.

Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? We’re bringing back a selection of our best-read Premium stories for your summer reading. This story was first published in September. Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Title: The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a good choice if you want to buy a pair of earbuds almost exclusively for FPS games

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a specialist product that excels in its particular niche. With clear, directional sound, they’re perfect for competitive shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and might even give you a slight advantage over your competition, but the very flat bass and lack of in-built microphone make them a poor fit for more general gaming in other genres. Comfortable with a wide range of fit options Clear, high fidelity spatial sound Fantastic included case Perfect for FPS games Lacks microphone Flat overall tuning Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Sony makes it very clear who the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are for. Developed in partnership with eSports team Fnatic, these wired in-ear monitor (IEM) style earbuds are squarely aimed at competitive first-person shooter (FPS) players or those with a generous budget aspiring to become one. Retailing for $149.99 / £129 / AU$209, they’re competing closely with some of the best gaming earbuds like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but don’t deliver the same all-round performance. If you’re looking for something that will elevate your experience in some of the best story games like God of War Ragnarok or Cyberpunk 2077, then these are certainly not it. The Sony Inzone E9 headphones are highly comfortable to wear and come with a superb carrying case, but the unapologetically flat sound is not going to help cutscenes or action sequences sound their best. The GameBuds, or even Sony’s own but more expensive Inzone Buds, are clearly better choices, but it's hard to fault the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones for that, as that’s obviously not what they’re for. They really come into their own in a competitive first-person shooter (FPS) setting, pairing well with games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Here, the lack of bass prevents explosion and gunfire sound effects from overwhelming your senses, allowing you to focus on the impressive directional reproduction instead. The direction of key audio cues like footsteps is crystal clear and remarkably easy to discern, potentially giving you an advantage over those without such specialised audio gear. The noise isolation is exquisite, thanks in no small part to the excellent seal of the headphones in your ears. A plethora of ear tips is included in the box to make it easy to find the perfect fit, and the included USB-C audio box stores EQ profile settings to make for a hassle-free setup every time - ideal if you’re competing in tournaments and need to access the same settings on a new machine. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are priced at $149.99 / £129 / AU$209. This is a significant investment for a pair of wired gaming earbuds, with top wireless options like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds costing not much more at $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$359. In addition to traditional gaming options, the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are also competing with the pricey in-ear monitor (IEM) earbuds favored by some FPS players. Here they come in at a very similar price to relatively affordable models from other big brands, such as the $149.99 / £129.99 Sennheiser IE 200. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are made specifically for gaming, however, setting them apart from most of the market and helping to justify the price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are available directly via Sony in the US and UK. They can also be found at a wide range of retailers, such as Best Buy in the US or Amazon in the UK. In Australia they’re in stock at both JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. Price $149.99 / £129 / AU$209 Weight 0.16oz / 4.7g Compatibility PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, mobile Connection type Wired (3.5mm / USB-C with audio box) Battery life N/A Features USB-C audio box, spatial audio Software Inzone Hub (PC) The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones will have a familiar design if you’ve used a pair of IEM earbuds before. They’re lightweight, with rounded earbuds connected to a rigid section of cable that hooks around the top of your ears. Two colorways are available: black and white. Both are rather plain, but the abundance of Inzone logo branding printed on the earbuds does give them some character. Sony has definitely made some smart decisions when it comes to practicality, particularly with the length of the headphone’s cable. At 5.9ft / 1.8m, I found that it was more than long enough to comfortably reach my ears directly from my gaming PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack without the need for a cable extender. If you play on a console, you won’t have any issues hooking it up to your controller. I also appreciate the clear left / right marking that’s printed on each earbud, with the latter presented in a bright red that makes it easy to spot at a glance. A wealth of alternate ear tips come in the box, with a total of eight pairs to choose from. This includes standard silicone rubber ear tips and more foamy noise isolation earbud tips, both in four sizes (ranging from extra small to extra large). These are Sony’s widespread EP-EX10A and EP-NI1010 series tips - so replacements are easy to find if you need them later down the line. You get a USB-C audio box for use with PCs, too. This can be used to store settings from the compatible Inzone Hub software, like your desired equalizer pre-sets or custom profiles. It also lets you use a dedicated spatial sound mode, giving a good impression of sound in a 3D space, albeit at the cost of some overall fidelity. Between uses, you can store everything in the included carrying case that benefits from a surprisingly unique design. It’s divided into two compartments (one for the earbuds and the other for the audio box) joined together by a springy rubberized strip. The underside of the strip has little magnetic buttons, clipping down to keep everything in place. It might be a bit hard to imagine, but it works really well and is much more practical than the cheap pouches included with most earbuds these days. You also get a little Inzone-branded cable tidy, which is a neat bonus. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones have quite a flat sound profile out of the box, though this is presumably intentional. There’s not a lot of bass leading to quite an unexciting sound. Playing through some Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Assassin’s Creed Shadows on PS5, key story moments felt a tad muted with the backing music missing the punch needed to really drive the emotion home. You can address this somewhat by tweaking the EQ settings in the compatible Inzone Hub software, but there’s only so much that you can do to increase the bass on hardware that’s not designed for it. For story-focused games, the results were never punchier than what you get out of the box with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and far less effective than even cheap wired over-ear sets like the Corsair HS50. This lack of bass makes a lot more sense when you jump into a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. Flashbangs and grenades are no longer overwhelming and don’t threaten to deafen you if you’re playing at higher volumes. Gunfire is more subdued, helping you stay focused in firefights. The sound is crystal clear too, with an impressive level of directionality that makes it easy to track enemy movements using key sounds like footsteps. It’s very impressive, especially given how well the effect holds up in more frantic situations. Diving into an explosive match of Nuketown in Black Ops 7, I was able to accurately hear where nearby opponents were moving, even against the constant barrage of explosions conjured by grenades and killstreaks. The detail is excellent, which is borderline essential in tense extraction shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, where being able to discern the subtle snapping of a twig can often mean the difference between life and death. If you’re currently one of the many people devoting every waking moment to Arc Raiders, I could see the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones being worth the asking price on this fact alone. Despite offering no active noise cancellation (ANC), the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones do a commendable job of blocking out background noise by virtue of the strong seal of their fit. No, it’s not as effective as the ANC of the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but it is good enough to drown out household sounds and conversations with the volume set at a decent level. Although very uncommon in the IEM market, I’m also a little disappointed that the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones don’t come with a small built-in microphone. It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it did mean that I had to reach for my Final VR2000 gaming earbuds when I wanted to chat with a friend while playing an Xbox Series X game. You’re a die-hard FPS fanIf you’re an FPS-head shopping for a pair of earbuds that you want to use exclusively to play the latest shooters, then the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones could be a very worthwhile investment. You want every possible advantageThe directionality offered by the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones is excellent and could mean the difference between a win and a loss in a competitive gaming setting. Pick up a pair if you want to ensure you have every possible advantage. You want a general use pairThe flat sound profile of the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones means that they’re not ideal for general use. At this price, there are loads of strong alternatives if you want something designed for a wider selection of genres with a microphone to help you chat with friends.

For more information, check out our full Sony Inzone Buds review I tested the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones over a period of roughly two and a half months. During that time, they were my primary gaming earbuds across all of my usual platforms. This included PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC. I tried the earbuds with a wide selection of games, ranging from story-based titles such as Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater to some of the most popular FPS games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Black Ops 7, Valorant, and Counter-Strike 2. Throughout my time with the earbuds, I compared their performance to my hands-on testing of a wide range of other gaming audio devices across the price spectrum.

Title: Man cycling from Cork to Mount Everest to raise money for children’s wards

A YOUNG MAN riding a bike from Ireland to Mount Everest has said he is doing it to “give back” to the Cork community which has supported him in the past. Daragh Cronin is hoping his mammoth journey will raise €30,000 for children’s wards at Cork University Hospital (CUH). Cronin said the charity was close to his heart and that he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive “best-in-class paediatric care”. He also wanted to inspire children of the region to “chase their dreams”. Cronin’s journey will begin at Blackrock hurling club on 14 February and take him on a ferry from Rosslare to France, then trekking out over Europe and the Middle East before heading to Everest base camp. The 23-year-old Cork man is no stranger to long-distance bike journeys, having navigated the length of Africa by riding almost 13,500km between Morocco and South Africa “with zero prior cycling or camping experience”. He said that experience had inspired him to raise money for the hospital, through the CUH Charity. Advertisement He said he had been told his Africa trip would be “impossible” without experience. “I had guns pointed in my face. But 99% of the time, there was genuine hospitality and huge amounts of kindness,” he said. “I know these things are coming my way again but I trust my instinct, I was able to talk my way out of some hairy situations in Africa.” Now, with his trip to Everest, he said: “This time I want to do it for a cause. “I had crazy support when I went to Africa, half of Cork had my back, so I want to do something to give back this time.” The route will see him cross the tip of Oman, through Pakistan, India and Nepal before he reaches Mount Everest. “The record I’m trying to set is to hike the bike from a place called Lukla (in Koshi Province) to Everest base camp, and no Irish person has done that,” he said. “I will cycle as far as I can through Nepal, on to Lukla, and then put the bike over my neck and get to base camp.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/man-cycling-cork-mount-everest-cork-hospital-6923377-Jan2026/?embedpost=6923377&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Access to the comments facility has been disabled for this user Create an email alert based on the current article

Title: Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Sergey Brin are close to joining the $300 billion club as tech fortunes soar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The $200 billion club could soon be old hat as tech bosses ride the AI wave to new levels of wealth. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have seen their personal fortunes soar to over $250 billion each, putting all three men within striking distance of the $300 billion mark. For context, some of America's largest companies, including Costco, Netflix, Home Depot, Chevron, and Wells Fargo, have market capitalizations between $300 billion and $400 billion. Page and Brin were worth $281 billion and $261 billion, respectively, at Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They added $101 billion and $92 billion to each of their fortunes in 2025, making them the year's biggest wealth gainers after Elon Musk, and have gained another $12 billion and $11 billion each already this year. The key driver has been Alphabet shares soaring 65% last year, and rising a further 4.5% so far in 2026, as investors have grown more and more excited about the search-and-advertising titan's AI efforts. Bezos' wealth has climbed more modestly, from $239 billion at the start of 2025 to $268 billion at Friday's close. That reflects a roughly 5% rise in Amazon's stock price last year, and another 6% rise this year, as investors wager the e-commerce giant's massive AI investments will start to pay off. Only Musk is richer than the trio; the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was worth $639 billion at Friday's close. He saw a $165 billion wealth jump last year, thanks to Tesla stock gaining 11% and SpaceX's valuation leaping from $350 billion to $800 billion. He's added an unmatched $19 billion to his name so far in 2026. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Musk in wealth last September, when his fortune ballooned by a record $89 billion in a single day to $388 billion. Since then, investors have cooled on Oracle's AI prospects, pushing down Ellison's net worth to $251 billion at Friday's close. In total, there are 18 "centibillionaires," or individuals with at least a $100 billion net worth. As a group, they grew $708 billion richer last year, lifting their combined wealth to $3.6 trillion — a figure greater than Microsoft's market value. Within that elite group, there are seven people worth upward of $200 billion: Musk, Page, Bezos, Brin, Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury giant LVMH. All of them except Arnault own huge stakes in some of the world's leading AI companies, which have soared in value as investors rush to buy their shares on news of buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Advocates, including investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary, have told Business Insider that AI will supercharge productivity and boost corporate profits. But skeptics, like Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, have warned that tech giants are overinvesting in microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure in their scramble to win the AI race, creating a bubble that will burst disastrously down the line.

Title: Costco shoppers say these items basically make a membership pay for itself. We did the math.

Every time Dominick publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Costco is widely known for offering a wide selection of items at relatively low prices, but the club's $65 annual membership fee can deter some shoppers. Of course, the savings from occasional discounts on big-ticket items such as TVs, mattresses, and household appliances can easily exceed the cost of a year's membership, but those purchases are expensive and infrequent for most households. That leaves a lot of folks asking, as one curious customer on Reddit did, if Costco's discounts on the basics are enough to make a membership worth it. Doubters have good reason to be skeptical: retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target offer pretty competitive pricing on a lot of products, not to mention local grocery stores. And then there's pack sizes — a multi-year supply of aluminum foil might technically be a savings, but it probably isn't all that useful. Nor does it save money to get more of something perishable, like fresh fruit, only to throw a lot of it away. So, which product categories would actually make a Costco membership worth it? The question is increasingly important for US households who are focused on stretching their dollars, a consumer climate that has favored value-conscious retailers like Costco and Walmart. To find out, we rounded up several of the most popular responses from users in the Costco subreddit, along with a few additional ones based on our experience. We focused the list on more shelf-stable items that are typically consumed steadily throughout the year and visited a local warehouse to check prices. We then compared those prices to comparable offerings at traditional retailers, such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, and others. We also asked ChatGPT to estimate how much of each item a typical two-person household would likely use in a year and compared annual costs before discounts based on those quantities. With a few exceptions, we used prices from national brands that are widely available in many retailers for an apples-to-apples comparison. Price gaps can be even more competitive with store brand alternatives. While everything on the list was cheaper at Costco in-store, we calculated a payback score for each item to represent how much of the $65 membership fee is accounted for in relative savings after one year of shopping exclusively for that one item at Costco versus a conventional retailer. For example, a payback score of 100 means the savings and the fee are equal; a score of 200 means the savings were twice the fee, and a score of 50 means that half the fee was offset by that single product. Again, this analysis assumes no other purchases at Costco, which in our experience is extremely unlikely. Here's what we found, ranked from lowest to highest. A 38-pound bag of Blue Buffalo dog food sells for $65 at Costco, while the equivalent weight at a typical retailer would cost $111. At that rate, the membership fee would be offset in less than two purchases. Assuming 10 purchases a year, this item yields a payback score of 713, meaning the savings would cover the membership fee plus six times the cost of this item alone. Costco also sells highly rated dog food under its Kirkland Signature brand for $35 per 40-pound bag. A jumbo pack of Huggies diapers sells for $50 at Costco, while it would cost about $70 to get the same quantity (156 diapers) elsewhere. At that rate, savings on diapers alone would offset the membership fee in less than four purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 373, meaning the savings would pay for the membership fee plus three times again for this item alone. Costco also sells diapers under its Kirkland Signature brand for a lower unit cost. Costco sells large containers of Similac for $55, which is about $13 less than it would cost to get the same product at a typical retailer. That means a membership fee would be offset after five purchases. Assuming one purchase a month yields a payback score of 240. Costco also sells generic baby formula at roughly half the unit cost of Similac, and Costco's offering is produced by the same leading supplier, Perrigo, that other major retailers use for their store brands. Costco sells 2-pound bags of Starbucks Pike Place roast coffee beans for $8.40 per pound, while typical retailers sell the same beans for about $12 per pound. At that rate, the savings would offset the membership fee after nine purchases, or 18 pounds of coffee. Assuming a household consumes 30 pounds of coffee a year yields a payback score of 166. Beyond Starbucks, Costco regularly features local coffee roasters and specially sourced beans from coffee-growing regions around the world at a lower cost than conventional retail. Costco has 2.5-pound blocks of Tillamook cheddar cheese for sale at $4 per pound, which is about $2.60 less per pound than typical retailers. Assuming a household uses about half a pound a week would amount to roughly 25 pounds a year. At these rates, a Costco membership would be almost equally offset by savings on cheese for a payback score of 102. Bacon is incredibly subjective. Still, the closest match found to this $4.33 per pound thick-cut bacon from Costco costs $8 per pound at a Midwestern grocery chain. At three pounds per package, that works out to a difference of $11, which would offset the membership fee after about six purchases. Assuming a household consumes 15 pounds of bacon a year would only account for five purchases for a payback score of 85. Costco sells chicken stock in packs of six quarts for $9 per pack — that's about a third of what it would cost to get the same amount of chicken stock in individual packs from a traditional retailer. Assuming three purchases a year (18 quarts total) gives a payback score of 83. Buying three pounds of Fage Total 2% Greek Yogurt at a conventional retailer would cost about $2.70 more than getting a tub from Costco. Assuming a household consumes about a pound of yogurt a week on average works out to 17 purchases a year, for a payback score of 71. One product Costco is known for is its comically large packs of paper products, like these 30-packs of Charmin toilet paper. Before discounts, the $33 pack works out to $1.10 per roll, which is 37 cents cheaper per roll than an equivalent pack bought elsewhere for $44. Assuming a household uses 10 rolls of toilet paper a month would mean four purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 67. At $1.25 per pound, Costco's six-pack of Barilla pasta costs about $4 less than the same amount bought elsewhere. Assuming a weekly spaghetti night that uses one pound of pasta, this works out to nine purchases a year, resulting in a payback score of 54. Costco sometimes sells products in quantities that exceed a year's supply. Brita recommends changing its filters every two months, so this ten-pack would last well into next year. Still, Costco's pre-discount unit price of $4.50 is about $3 less than individual filters cost at conventional retailers. If purchased in equal quantities, the Costco pack would be about $30 less, for a payback score of 45. Cascade dishwasher pods cost about $7.30 less at Costco (before discounts) than an equivalent quantity bought at a typical retailer. If a household runs the dishwasher once a day, it would need to buy four packs in a year, which works out to a payback score of 45. Bear with us for this one. HVAC filters may seem boring, but manufacturers recommend replacing them at least every three months for optimal performance, and that can add up quickly. Costco's four-pack of 3M Filtrete air filters comes in at $28 less than the same product elsewhere. Most households will only need to buy one pack a year, though, so the payback score would be 43. It's also worth noting that there are less expensive types of HVAC filters on the market that Costco doesn't sell. The way Costco executives have described it, the company isn't looking to sell the cheapest available products; it wants to find the sweet spot that balances both high quality and low price. Opti-Free contact lens solution is about 25% less expensive by volume when purchased at Costco, compared with a traditional retailer. A household that uses about 12 ounces a month would need to buy four of these packs in the course of a year, with a payback score of 42. Shoppers can generally save money by switching from national brand medications to generics. A bottle of 365 tablets of cetirizine, better known as Zyrtec, costs $13.50 before discounts at Costco, while the same quantity from some other stores' brands can easily cost nearly $40. Still, 365 tablets are more than many households might need in a year, so a single purchase would make sense, resulting in a payback score of 40. Like medicines and meats, Costco also has low prices on cooking oils. This store-branded olive oil is about half the price per liter of a similar store-branded alternative at another retailer. Assuming a household uses three liters a year, yields a payback score of 25. This Arm & Hammer laundry detergent from Costco costs $14.89, or about $0.07 a load, versus $0.11 a load for the same product at other retailers. Assuming a household would go through two 200-ounce jugs in a year gives a payback score of 22. Like medications, generic vitamins from Costco can be extremely cost-effective — about 20% less than a similar product elsewhere. Two adults taking one daily multivitamin each would mean five purchases of these gummies in a year for a payback score of 18. Costco's $1.50 hot dog and soda combo gets a lot of attention. After all, it's not every day that an executive is explicitly warned to never raise the price. However, we crunched the numbers, and it turns out that roughly one Costco combo a month (14.4 a year, to be exact) would save you $65 compared to getting a similar meal from a chain like Portillo's or Nathan's. The bigger advantage is the jumbo pizzas for less than $10. By comparison, the largest pizza Domino's makes is 14 inches, which costs $15 and is actually about two-thirds the area of Costco's 18-inch. For the equivalent square inches of cheese or pepperoni pizza, Costco's offering is about $12 less, which means the annual fee would be offset with six pizzas. The math on the $5 rotisserie chickens is slightly less favorable to Costco, as many grocery stores offer a similar product. We'd love to hear about your best Costco picks.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

They hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

Title: The billionaire's social calendar for 2026: The must-attend events for the world's wealthiest business icons

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed. The world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences. "Birds of a feather flock together," Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider. Each year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said. 2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars. Here's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them. Business leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs. This year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed "A Spirit of Dialogue." While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Access to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public. Apartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog. NFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on. These billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception. "The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment," Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider. Host committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash. The most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year. As Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires. Oprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee "The Nickel Boys" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont. This year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful "Hamnet," and James Cameron, director of "Avatar: Fire and Ash." The Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires. Each year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters. The tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave. The general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system. Every year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles. Dubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters. While the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers. The event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission. While billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup. "The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup," Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider. The soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market. While the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool. There will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal. Private jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. Since 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett. The conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995. Last year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced. The vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing. Burning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019. Last year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years. Still, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way. This year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project. The coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys. The 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons. Last year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million. In the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show. The Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800. October presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections. First, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there. Shortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit. Last year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill. A painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps. While the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs. Formula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades. The racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures. The various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names. Last year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll. Three-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options. While Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year. Last year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club. For those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night. "There is nothing mass-market about it," Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. "It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy." Jump to

Daily Tech News 11 January 2026 Top Story Meta has signed long-term contracts with three suppliers for a total of 6GW of nuclear power for its datacenters. (Tech Crunch) Two of the partners are startups developing small modular reactors; the third, Vistra, is a major operator of traditional large non-modular reactors. Meanwhile researchers in China have managed to break the Greenwald limit on the number of alt accounts a single journalist can have agreeing with his posts before he screws up. (The Independent) Wait, I'm told in this context it's an empirical limit on sustained plasma densities in Tokamak-style fusion reactors. With this breakthrough, fusion power is now only nineteen years and twelve months away. Tech News It's a water heater! It's a Bitcoin miner! It's both! (Tom's Hardware) Given that the main cost of mining Bitcoin is the energy it takes - and disposing of the waste heat somehow - why not use it for, say, heating water? The Superheat H1 does exactly that. And if the price of Bitcoin collapses, it still heats your water. Can light move faster than the speed of light? (Science Daily) Some theories of loop quantum gravity predict small fluctuations of the speed of light in a vacuum. New experiments put an upper bound on how big those fluctuations could be, ruling out some of these theories. I call them theories rather than mere speculation because they actually made sufficiently robust predictions to be ruled out in the first place. A theory can be wrong, but it's not a theory if you can't test it. Can AI do your job? (MSN) If you're a computer programmer, or you otherwise work solely with words, possibly yes. If you do literally anything else, the best AI models currently succeed at 2.5% of human tasks. AMD will be launching socketed versions of the Ryzen 400 processor series later this year. (WCCFTech) Too late, really. Zen 6 will be out this year, and if you want integrated graphics it looks like Intel's Panther Lake is faster - though only if you are willing to go with a system with soldered memory. If you need conventional DIMM or SODIMM memory, you get models cut down from 12 GPU cores to just 4, which isn't beating anything. So maybe not too late, but underwhelming. And if you want dedicated graphics, you might need to buy soon. (Tom's Hardware) Nvidia GPUs are hardest hit so far, with reports of stock on all models running low in Germany and Japan. Since that was the first direct warning we had of the memory crunch (though in retrospect the signs were there months earlier) I bought myself a 9060 XT while they were in stock and on sale. Which as of time of writing, they still are. Asus and Gigabyte are putting 64MB of ROM on their new AM5 motherboards. (Tom's Hardware) Earlier AM4 motherboards often had as little as 16MB of ROM for the BIOS, which became a problem as AMD kept releasing new chips for the platform - Socket AM4 first appeared in 2016, even before Zen 1, and the most recent new processor for that socket, the 5500X3D, was launched in June last year. There were simply too many different models of compatible processors to fit all the necessary code into 16MB. With AM5 confirmed to support the upcoming Zen 6 chips later this year, and strongly hinted to support Zen 7 due in 2028, it will end up being an even longer-lived platform with more CPUs, so motherboard makers are fixing the problem before it arises. Amazon is using AI to sell your products on their store without you having to lift a finger. (Modern Retail) Also, without Amazon ever asking permission to do so. Also also, without Amazon bothering to sync the data properly from your online store so that they don't, for example, still list long-discontinued products for sale. Store owners are not happy. NBC News is intensifying a collapse of trust online. (NBC News) No, they didn't have a brief moment of self-awareness. They're blaming three years of AI for thirty years of their own failings. Musical Interlude In 2008, a young Suzuka Nakamoto was part of a short-lived trio called Karen Girl's - yes, with the misplaced apostrophe - and performed Over the Future, the opening theme for the anime series Zettai Karen Children. You may know her better as the lead singer for Babymetal. Thanks Mikeski for pointing me to the Babymetal cover of Over the Future. (I checked three different versions of the first clip.

Speaking of data centers and water... during a county zoning meeting this past summer, the county executives were attempting to slide a center into an area of farmland being rezoned. It was revealed that the center would consume millions of gallons of water a month. More than half the current residential consumption. And up to 50% of that water evaporated during the cooling process for the processors at the datacenter. The rest wasn't recycled due to contamination and would have to stored in evaporation ponds. Half of the local, residential water would be consumed by this thing. And there was no plan to increase the water capacity. I'll note that this was only part of the county. The entire county wouldn't end up dry.... just this one, little, undeveloped area nobody seemed to notice. Except for everyone who lived there.

I had no choice though, I wasn't going to watch and listen to those two dogs tear my dog apart. $60k in hospital bills. It was pretty hairy.

We already struck ISIS in Syria for killing 2 National Guard (Iowa, I think) and their American interpreter, so assets are in the region.

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs have experienced a turbulent start to 2026 after early inflows were wiped out by four consecutive days of withdrawals. Amid Bitcoin’s recent failure to sustain its market recovery above $94,000, institutional investors are seeking more stability, especially considering the falling chances of a possible interest rate cut. According to data from the ETF tracker site, SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered $681 million in net outflows in the first full trading week of 2026. Notably, these investment funds had commenced the year on a positive note, notching $697.2 million in net deposits on January 5 after an initial $471.1 million inflow on January 2. However, a combined net outflow of $1.378 billion between January 6-9 soon cleared out all positive momentum driven by the earlier inflows. In analyzing individual ETF performance, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced the largest net redemptions valued at $481.32 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $171.79 million. Meanwhile, Ark/21Shares’ ARKB also had a sizable contribution to the overall weekly negative performance as its withdrawals exceeded deposits by $45.34 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with red performances include Grayscale’s BTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, with net outflows varying between $3 million and $22 million. On the other side of the spectrum, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest net inflow of the week, valued at $25.86 million. The BlackRock flagship crypto ETF continues to dominate with a remarkable cumulative net inflow of $62.41 billion, as its total net assets climb to $69.88 billion. Other ETFs with a positive performance include Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which also attracted net investments between $1 million and $15 million. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s DEFI stood alone as the only ETF with a zero netflow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs boast a cumulative total net inflow of $56.40 billion. Meanwhile, their total net assets are valued at $116.86 billion and represents 6.48% of the Bitcoin market cap. Interestingly, the Ethereum Spot ETFs produced a similar weekly performance. Initial net deposits of $282.87 million between January 5 and January 6 were followed by three consecutive days of heavy withdrawals, resulting in a net outflow of $68.57 million. The Ethereum ETFs now hold $18.70 billion in total net assets, representing 5.04% ofthe Ethereum market cap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands at $90,422 as price movement over the last week resulted in a minor 0.17% decline. Meanwhile, Ethereum is valued at $3,088 while its daily trading volume crashes by 63.46%. Featured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jensen Huang pitches Nvidia's self-driving car tech, sparks reaction from Tesla's Elon Musk

Jensen Huang took the stage at the CES trade show in Las Vegas this week to make the clearest pitch yet for Nvidia Corp.’s autonomous driving technology. In doing so, the chief executive officer’s vision for vehicles that can drive themselves edged into the terrain of major customers like Tesla Inc. and its boss, Elon Musk. Huang’s remarks sparked a widely watched — if notably polite — indirect multiday exchange between two of the most influential figures in technology. It also sharpened a central question about autonomous driving: Who controls the technology that will first power consumer cars that drive themselves — and later, driverless cars known as robotaxis that are designed for ride-hailing? And whose autonomous vehicle system is the best? On Monday, Huang used his speech to America’s largest technology showcase to extol the virtues of Nvidia’s Alpamayo, an open-source AI model designed to speed development of Level 4 self-driving cars. Such cars — consumer-owned at first, and robotaxi-fleet-operated later — can drive themselves without human supervision or intervention, within a defined geographic area. Nvidia described Alpamayo as part of a broader toolkit it offers automakers on top of open models. That includes powerful chips in data centers to train self-driving software, chips inside vehicles that serve as the car’s “brain” while it’s on the road, and simulation software that can create vast amounts of driving data virtually — reducing the time and cost of collecting it in the real world. The pitch was aimed squarely at automakers. Nvidia wants to supply the intelligence layer for autonomy without building the car itself, but it still wants to own the technology that makes self-driving a reality. “The world’s first thinking, reasoning, autonomous vehicle AI,” Huang proudly announced, clad in a shiny leather jacket. That afternoon, Musk weighed in with a post on X after a user shared a transcript of Huang’s remarks. “Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing ????,” Musk wrote. The Tesla CEO added that while getting a system to work most of the time is relatively easy, solving rare and unpredictable edge cases is far harder. The world’s richest man has claimed for a long time that Tesla’s system will have the ability to reason — that is, to make humanlike decisions in specific traffic scenarios — after a future software update. Earlier this week, his chief AI lieutenant, Ashok Elluswamy, responded to a question on X, saying a further update will come in the current quarter. Huang learned of Musk’s response during an interview with Bloomberg Television at CES the next day. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” Huang interjected, of Musk’s claim to already be doing reasoning. “I think the Tesla stack is the most advanced AV stack in the world.” Tesla shares ended the week higher by 1.6%, closing Friday at $445.01. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who has a buy rating and $600 price target on the stock, had posted on X earlier in the week after Huang’s keynote that Nvidia’s strategy “validated” Tesla’s approach. What drew broader attention was the tone of the aftermath of Nvidia’s announcement. The exchange went viral — not because of confrontation, but because of restraint. The two rivals acknowledged each other’s technical credibility while advancing different paths. Tesla and Nvidia already have an important, if uneven, relationship. Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs – the chips that go into data centers to train its autonomous driving software — even as it builds its own in-house chips to run that software inside vehicles. Musk has said Tesla will have spent roughly $10 billion cumulatively on Nvidia hardware for training by the end of this year, and that figure would be higher had it not worked on their own AI chips. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, is also a major Nvidia customer, and Nvidia is an investor in xAI. Tesla and Nvidia are fundamentally different companies. Tesla makes cars and builds the full system end to end. Nvidia builds chips and software that others use. Their technologies are different too. Tesla has a vision-only approach, just relying on camera sensors. The company argues it’s the most economically viable approach at scale and avoids sensors confusing one another. The rest of the industry argues other sensors like lidar, radar and ultrasonics are better because they are safer and offer redundancy. But the dynamic underscores how unsettled the autonomous vehicle arms race remains. Tesla depends on Nvidia to build its software, even as Nvidia builds tools that could one day help Tesla’s rivals catch up. Their paths to consumers also increasingly overlap. Tesla sells a suite of features known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), a driver-assistance system that requires the vehicle’s operator to remain at the wheel and watch the road. The system Tesla sells is capable of point-to-point driving with navigation, lane changes and can react to traffic, but drivers still need to keep their eyes on the road. Nvidia now also sells advanced driver-assistance and autonomy platforms to automakers. And those automakers, in turn, pitch the systems to the consumer in the cars they sell. Market analysts see robotaxis as the endgame, with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo currently leading real-world commercial deployments and Tesla arguing it can win at scale. Before that, the proving ground is consumer-owned cars that can do more of the driving themselves under owner supervision, serving as a bridge toward wider robotaxi adoption. Tesla sees FSD as a stepping stone to a future robotaxi network it would control. Nvidia is pursuing a similar endgame, working with other technology companies, automakers and ride-hailing companies, including Uber Technologies Inc. Again, Nvidia would just provide the tech and sees it powering fleets of robotaxis as soon as 2027. Tesla is betting on winning autonomy as a specialist, while Nvidia is positioning itself as the arms dealer, selling tools to the entire industry. Huang said the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA will be the first car to use Nvidia’s stack, offering FSD-like capabilities. Deliveries are starting in the US in early 2026 and rolling out to Europe and Asia later in the year. Moving beyond that would require additional hardware, such as lidar, adding cost and underscoring how far today’s cars remain from full autonomy. Musk returned to the subject of Nvidia’s push into autonomous vehicles on Tuesday, arguing it posed little immediate threat to Tesla’s efforts. The technology, he said, was far from being ready to be rolled out safely on a large scale. “The actual time from when FSD sort of works to where it is much safer than a human is several years,” he wrote on X, adding that meaningful competition for Tesla could still be at least five or six years away. For all the ambition on display, Huang and Musk have both effectively indicated that fully autonomous driving at scale is still a distant prospect. And for both, the nearer proving ground comes first: cars that can drive themselves part of the way. Who wins that phase may help decide who dominates the next one.

Title: Nvidia resets the economics of AI factories, again

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’sGrok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s.

Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’sGrok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

Title: BlackRock warns crypto’s love affair with AI is over as an energy war with Bitcoin miners begins

For years, Bitcoin mining fought an optics war over energy. Now AI is walking into the same grid, with a very different pitch: jobs, national competitiveness, and always-on demand. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is telling clients to stop looking at artificial intelligence as software and start treating it as energy. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that the AI buildout is pushing against physical limits and highlighted electricity as the constraint investors are underpricing. The report’s headline-grabber is its warning that AI-driven data centers could consume as much as 24% of US electricity by 2030, a scale that would reorder everything from utility capex to industrial siting. That kind of forecast lands with an obvious follow-on question in crypto: if grid access becomes the scarce asset, what happens to the industry that built a business model around turning cheap, interruptible power into Bitcoin? In 2025, narratives arrived around the potential synergy of crypto and AI due to the theory that AI agents will want to use crypto for payments over traditional finance. However, a power war may tarnish this relationship going forward. For years, mining has lived in a political argument about energy waste. The industry’s counterargument has always been operational: miners can be the flexible load, switching off when the grid is stressed and soaking up surplus generation when prices collapse. In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has explicitly designed programs for “large flexible customers, such as Bitcoin mining facilities,” encouraging curtailment during peak demand. But AI data centers come with a different consumption profile, different contract terms, and a different level of political support. They don't want to power down, ever. They want the baseload. BlackRock’s broader point is that the AI boom is unusually capital-intensive. The firm cites a $5 trillion to $8 trillion range of total capital spending intentions for the AI buildout through 2030, with heavy spending on compute, data centers, and energy infrastructure. What began as a race for chips has quickly become a race for megawatts. There’s wide agreement that data center electricity demand is rising fast, even if analysts debate the ceiling. A Department of Energy announcement tied to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s data center report says data center load growth in the US has tripled over the past decade. Moreover, it is projected to double or triple by 2028. EPRI modeling from 2024 cited by Utility Dive put US data centers at 4.6% to 9.1% of US generation by 2030, depending on AI uptake and efficiency gains. A World Resources Institute explainer, citing a Berkeley Lab study, points to 6.7% to 12% of US electricity consumption by 2030. (wri.org) BlackRock’s “up to 25%” framing sits at the aggressive end of that spectrum, and is meant to be provocative. Yet even the lower-end scenarios would be enough to tighten power markets and harden the grid politics around who gets to plug in first. Reuters reported that utilities and grid operators are already adjusting rate structures and rules as hyperscalers and colocation firms scramble for capacity, especially in hotspots like Texas and Northern Virginia. That’s the environment Bitcoin miners are walking into. They are large, mobile power users, and they're first in line in regions with abundant generation or attractive pricing. Until now, those traits looked like advantages. Bitcoin mining is brutally simple at the physics layer. Specialized computers perform hashing to secure the network, and electricity is the dominant input cost. When power is cheap relative to Bitcoin’s price and network difficulty, miners print cash. When power is expensive, they shut down, relocate, or go bankrupt. That operational flexibility has become the industry’s best talking point as public scrutiny has increased. The US Energy Information Administration estimated crypto mining likely represented about 0.6% to 2.3% of electricity consumption in the US in 2024, a small share in percentage terms but large enough to show up in local politics and grid planning. Texas is the cleanest case study because the state’s competitive power market turns that flexibility into revenue. In a 2023 SEC filing, Riot Platforms said it curtailed power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand in August 2023, choosing to forego mining revenue to support ERCOT reliability. CryptoSlate reported that ERCOT paid a miner $31.7 million in energy credits that month to power down during a heat wave, a detail that captures both the value of flexibility and why the politics can get ugly fast. Powering profitability through energy credits, Riot Platforms navigates crypto market downturn. Now put that model next to AI. Training and serving large models need constant power and tight uptime. A hyperscaler signing a long-term lease wants predictable delivery, not voluntary curtailment. If miners are the shock absorber, then AI is the shock creator. And BlackRock’s yearly outlook effectively says that the shock is coming and there's no stopping it. In the mining playbook, “cheap power” means stranded hydro, surplus wind at night, or a friendly industrial tariff. But as data centers scale, cheap power becomes a moving target, because grid access itself becomes the bottleneck. Interconnection queues and transmission delays are the new friction. Even when a region has generation, it may not have the wires, the transformers, or the permitting pathway to deliver it to a new 500-megawatt campus. NERC has warned about reliability threats from rapid load growth tied to AI, data centers, EVs, and electrification colliding with generator retirements and slow buildouts. (Financial Times) That matters for miners because their advantage is speed. They can drop containers on a site, energize, and start hashing faster than a conventional industrial plant can ramp. But if the gating item becomes substation capacity and interconnection approval, then that speed turns into a regulatory contest. When power markets tighten, lawmakers start looking for villains. Mining has often been convenient because it feels optional, even to people who understand nothing about it. In contrast, AI is now being both to the public and to lawmakers as national competitiveness. That asymmetry is what will shape policy. It's easier to impose reporting requirements or additional tariffs on miners than on the data centers the local chamber of commerce is courting. It's also easier to frame mining as a speculative luxury and frame AI as the backbone of defense, productivity, and medicine. If BlackRock is right that AI’s energy footprint will become a macro risk, the political coalition supporting grid investment may widen, but so may the pressure to prioritize “productive” loads. Miners might respond by leaning harder into the flexibility story. A Duke University report cited by Utility Dive argues the existing US grid can handle significant new load if it can be curtailed during stress events, and mining can do that. Many AI workloads, especially inference for consumer products, generally can't. That creates a potential wedge: miners as a controllable load that helps integrate renewables, versus data centers as an inflexible load. This argument is already brewing in policy circles and utility commission hearings. However, whether it wins will depend on local economics and lobbying, not internet debates. There's another adaptation path already underway: pivoting from hashing to hosting. The logic is straightforward. If you already own land, power rights, and a substation, you have what AI developers need most. And if your legacy business is volatile, the prospect of contracted cash flows from compute hosting is tempting. CryptoSlate reported in October that some firms originally focused on Bitcoin mining have been pivoting toward AI infrastructure, with deals tied to cloud and AI workloads, precisely because power access in places like Texas has become valuable. The article’s message is not that every miner will become an AI landlord, but that the industry’s prime asset is shifting from machines to megawatts. With 500MW and 168MW hosting deals inked, miners get financing-friendly dollars while hashrate and fee trajectories determine who captures the upside. This pivot is harder than it sounds. AI data centers require different cooling, different network architecture, and different uptime guarantees. Mining can tolerate interruptions, but many AI customers won't. The cost of retrofitting can be enormous, and the competition includes specialist data center operators with deep relationships and financing advantages. Yet the direction of travel is clear. When power becomes scarce, the highest-value use of a megawatt tends to win. BlackRock’s forecast isn't about Bitcoin specifically, but about the end of cheap abundance. If AI pushes the US toward a world where electricity demand grows fast, and transmission remains slow, any business built on marginal power economics gets squeezed. Of course, miners won't disappear. Bitcoin’s incentive structure is designed to keep hash power online somewhere, and the industry’s mobility means it can chase new energy pockets. But the center of gravity could shift. Regions with surplus generation and friendly policy will likely see miners as a stabilizing industrial load, especially if they can credibly offer curtailment. Regions courting hyperscalers will surely treat miners as a second priority. The likely outcome is a barbell. On one side: miners that integrate with grids, sign structured demand-response agreements, and become part of utility planning. On the other: miners that turn their energy positions into broader compute infrastructure, essentially arbitraging their early arrival in power markets into a new line of business. Either way, the easy era is ending. BlackRock’s warning that AI data centers could swell to an enormous share of US power demand is a reminder that the next phase of digital infrastructure won't be constrained by code, but by the messy physical world of wires, permits, turbines, and heat.

Title: US to secure $800bn in Ukraine reconstruction contracts – The Telegraph
URL: https://www.rt.com/russia/630786-us-ukraine-reconstruction-deal/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T17:04:31Z
Full Content:
Washington and Kiev are preparing to sign an $800 billion agreement to rebuild Ukraine, The Telegraph has reported. The deal is scheduled to be sealed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos later this month, Western sources told the newspaper. The agreement is reportedly structured around the rare earth minerals deal clinched by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump last year. The accord grants Washington preferential access to the resources; however, the security guarantees long sought by Kiev are not included. At the time, Trump promoted the agreement as a way to recover what he described as the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by the previous administration. Earlier this week, he reiterated that a deal on rare earth metals was a condition for the White House to continue its efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukraine conflict. “I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday. “We want our money back.” Officials told The Telegraph that the “prosperity” plan envisages attracting around $800 billion over ten years through a combination of loans, grants and private-sector investment. The newspaper noted that US envoy Steve Witkoff called the agreement a crucial part of the overall ceasefire package he has been negotiating for the past few months. The top state official reportedly said that the world’s largest investment group, BlackRock, would participate in the program. Trump repeatedly criticized unconditional aid to Kiev in the past, calling Zelensky “the greatest salesman on earth.” Last year, he said his predecessor, Joe Biden, had “fleeced” America by committing $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. He has since argued that the US is now profiting from the conflict by sending Ukraine weapons which are being paid for by Washington’s European NATO partners. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Kiev, arguing that they prolong the fighting without altering its outcome.

Kansas City police Officer Matt Masters first used a Taser in the early 2000s. He said it worked well for taking people down; it was safe and effective. “At the end of the day, if you have to put your hands on somebody, you got to scuffle with somebody, why risk that?” he said. “You can just shoot them with a Taser.” Masters believed in that until his son Bryce was pulled over by an officer and shocked for more than 20 seconds. The 17-year-old went into cardiac arrest, which doctors later attributed to the Taser. Masters’ training had led him to believe something like that could never happen.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/10/big-short-investor-michael-burry-put-options-bet-oracle-stock-orcl/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:41:53Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

Title: Pro XRP Lawyer John Deaton Slams Warren’s Crypto War as Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto

Full Content:
John Deaton has once again slammed anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren, saying that she has lost her war on crypto. The pro-XRP lawyer opined that with Wall Street’s major entry into the industry, critics will likely change their stance. Deaton’s remarks come after financial giants, including Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and Vanguard, announced plans to offer their clients exposure to crypto assets. In an X post, Deaton mentioned several financial institutions on Wall Street that are dipping their toes into crypto. These include Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and Vanguard. He said that based on this, even the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, could soon affirm that “crypto is here to stay.” Deaton also suggested that the former chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, might issue a pro-crypto statement soon. “Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley – even Jamie Dimon says crypto’s here to stay. Someone tell Warren she lost the crypto war and her anti-crypto army has been dismantled. Soon, Gary Gensler will come out saying he was for crypto all along,” he stated. Last year, Deaton launched a Senate bid to unseat Warren in Massachusetts but failed to clinch the seat. Nevertheless, he has maintained his pro-crypto stance and continues to bash Warren, who earlier this year wrote a letter to crypto czar David Sacks, raising concerns about plans for a Bitcoin reserve. Deaton’s optimism regarding crypto adoption in the US follows a wave of interest from top financial institutions. According to the President of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, the surge has proven that crypto is not a scam. In an X post, he stated, “In the next few months, Charles Schwab will offer direct spot crypto trading to clients while Morgan Stanley will launch spot BTC & SOL ETFs… Meanwhile, Vanguard now allows clients to trade spot crypto ETFs. You see what’s happening here yet?” On December 6, Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer Bitcoin and Solana ETFs to its clients. If approved, the investment bank will join BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which already offer these products. The filing also comes when more investors are showing interest in ETFs that track the prices of different crypto tokens. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded $228 million in inflows on December 6, while Solana and XRP ETFs saw inflows of $9 million and $19 million, respectively.

Title: Tokenized Treasuries skyrocketed 125%, creating this “programmable cash” loop that banks are scrambling to copy

Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized real-world assets reached $19.72 billion on Jan. 9, the closest the market has come to the $20 billion threshold. That figure measures distributed assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets. As a result, it excludes another $19.78 billion in active private credit loans, which are tracked as represented assets on-chain for recordkeeping but don't enable open transfers. The distributed RWA market splits into three segments. US Treasuries and money market funds dominate, accounting for $8.86 billion in on-chain collateral. Tokenized commodities, led by gold, sit near $4 billion. The remainder, consisting of institutional funds at $2.84 billion, distributed private credit tokens at $2.32 billion, tokenized equities at $801 million, and bonds at $880 million, represents the experimental edge. Here, growth has been explosive, but issuer concentration remains extreme. Stablecoins, measured separately at $307.6 billion, dwarf the entire RWA stack and function as the liquidity rail that tokenized assets plug into. The past 12 months rewrote the trajectory. Treasuries roughly doubled. Institutional funds grew eightfold. Private credit's distributed tokens primarily represent loan participation, while the $19.78 billion in active loans, up 100% from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, reflects the actual lending activity that generates yield. Bitcoin treasury companies need a blend of price stability, strategic governance, and revived leverage demand. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from an estimated $3.95 billion in January 2025 to $8.86 billion by January 2026, a 125% increase. BlackRock's BUIDL fund crossed $2 billion in April 2025, one year after launch, and has distributed $100 million in dividends as of December of the same year. Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. Binance accepted BUIDL as collateral in November, and Ethena's USDtb stablecoin now backs 90% of reserves with BUIDL tokens. JPMorgan launched its own tokenized money market fund, MONY, on Ethereum in December, with a $100 million seed. The pattern: institutions are treating tokenized Treasuries as programmable cash. Smart contracts automate interest payments, redemptions happen 24/7, and tokens move peer-to-peer without intermediaries. Against $28 trillion in total outstanding US Treasuries, the tokenized segment remains microscopic, but infrastructure is scaling faster than adoption. Institutional alternative funds grew from roughly $350 million to $2.84 billion, a 714% increase. Centrifuge holds 34.29% market share, Securitize controls 31.02%. That concentration means partnership decisions by a handful of tokenization providers move the entire category. These funds bring private equity, credit, and structured products on-chain with familiar regulatory frameworks. Tokenization reduces friction in secondary trading and allows fractional ownership, while yields remain attractive from 8% to 12%. Additionally, on-chain settlement transparency appeals to institutional compliance teams. The catch: liquidity is issuer-dependent. Most secondary markets rely on redemption mechanisms controlled by fund managers rather than open order books. A 2025 academic analysis found that tokenized assets exhibit low trading volumes despite growing market caps. Until more venues offer compliant secondary trading, institutional funds will scale through issuance rather than true market-making. Tokenized commodities grew from approximately $1.06 billion to nearly $4 billion, driven almost entirely by gold. PAXG and XAUT account for over 80% of commodity activity, as demand spiked 227% as precious metals hit record highs. Tokenized public stocks reached $801.36 million, up from roughly $250 million, a 218% gain. Ondo Finance controls 51.6% by value. Monthly transfer volume hit $2.66 billion despite the modest market cap, indicating high turnover. Active addresses fell 26% over 30 days, suggesting participation is concentrating among fewer, more active traders. Corporate bonds total $193.31 million with 14,300 holders. Cashlink controls 62.49%, JPMorgan holds 25.86%. Non-U.S. government debt stands at $686.66 million, with Spiko accounting for 80.72%. These are proof-of-concept deployments where institutions test infrastructure before committing larger capital pools. Ethereum holds $12.6 billion, equivalent to 64.51% of the distributed RWA market. BNB Chain accounts for $2.02 billion (10.37%), Solana $924.59 million (4.75%), Stellar $829.48 million (4.26%), and Arbitrum $745.92 million (3.83%). Stellar grew 28.% over 30 days, the fastest expansion among major chains, while Solana gained 16.56% and BNB Chain 12.11%. Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Ethereum's dominance reflects first-mover advantage and institutional familiarity. BlackRock launched BUIDL on Ethereum before expanding to seven other blockchains. Nevertheless, multichain strategies are accelerating. Nearly 70% of BUIDL's assets now sit outside Ethereum, deployed where users and liquidity congregate. Interoperability providers like Wormhole enable seamless cross-chain transfers, which matters when liquidity fragments across networks. Private credit illustrates RWA.xyz's methodological shift in 2025. The platform now distinguishes “distributed” assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets, from “represented” assets, which use blockchain as a recordkeeping layer without enabling open transfer. Private credit's $2.32 billion in distributed value represents the tradable, transferable portion of loan participation tokens. The nearly $20 billion in active loans represents the underlying lending activity tracked on-chain but not freely transferable. The amount in active loans grew from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, representing a 100% gain. Cumulative loan originations totaled $36.29 billion across platforms such as Figure ($14.48B active), Tradable ($2.3B active), and Maple ($1.63B active). Borrowers pay an average APR of 10.14%. Figure dominates with 73% of active loans, operating on the Provenance blockchain. Tradable holds 12% on ZKSync Era, while Maple accounts for 8% across Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The distinction between distributed and represented matters because it reveals how tokenization serves different functions. Distributed private credit tokens allow secondary trading of loan participations, creating liquidity for an otherwise illiquid asset class. Represented assets use blockchain for transparency, reconciliation, and operational efficiency, without exposing loans to open-market trading. Most private credit remains in the “represented” category because lenders prefer controlled distribution over open secondary markets. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated in late 2025 that the majority of transactions will eventually settle on-chain. Private credit tests that thesis. If loan origination, servicing, and settlement move fully on-chain with distributed tokens, efficiency gains are substantial. However, custody for debt instruments, collateral management, and legal enforceability in insolvency all require more clarity before the market scales beyond its current $2.32 billion distributed footprint. Distributed RWAs could reach $30.8 billion (bear), $41.4 billion (base), or $57.0 billion (bull) by end-2027, assuming annual growth of 25%, 45%, and 70%, respectively. Tokenized Treasuries would scale to $13.8 billion (bear) or $19.9 billion (bull). Private credit's distributed tokens could reach $3.6 billion (bear) or $6.4 billion (bull), while the underlying active loans, measured separately as represented assets, could reach $28.5 billion (bear) or $50.6 billion (bull). The bull case requires specific catalysts: clear pathways for tokenized fund distribution in major jurisdictions, more venues for compliant secondary trading, and deeper integration of Treasuries as collateral across on-chain credit protocols. Private credit's evolution from represented to distributed depends on whether lenders embrace open secondary markets for loan participations or prefer controlled, permissioned transfer mechanisms. Those catalysts are materializing. The UK's FCA signaled a September 2026 crypto licensing gateway. Barclays backed Ubyx for tokenized money infrastructure. Visa and JPMorgan are experimenting with Solana rails. Wyoming’s Frontier launch plus a Wall Street wrapper filing happened fast, and the real institutional bet is on settlement rails. The bear case assumes infrastructure lags and regulatory uncertainty persists. Custody challenges remain central. Traditional custodians are still building capabilities for digital wallets, smart contract governance, and interoperability with tokenization platforms. Four factors determine whether 2027 looks like the base or bull case. First, tokenized Treasuries must become standard collateral across major trading venues and lending platforms. BlackRock's expansion to eight blockchains and integration with Ethena's stablecoin infrastructure is the template. Second, tokenized funds must solve the secondary market problem. Institutional alternative funds are growing eight times faster than other segments, but liquidity remains tied to issuer redemptions. If regulated venues support order-book trading for tokenized fund shares, the segment accelerates. Third, the custody and settlement infrastructure must be professionalized. Institutions allocate to assets they can safely custody and audit clearly. Progress is happening, as Zodia, Copper, and Fireblocks build enterprise-grade solutions, but adoption takes time. Fourth, stablecoin integration must deepen. At nearly $308 billion, stablecoins are the liquidity substrate for RWAs. The GENIUS Act provided clarity, and platforms are embedding stablecoins as settlement rails. China announced it will pay interest on the digital yuan, explicitly targeting dollar stablecoin competition. If US stablecoins remain competitive, RWAs benefit. The $20 billion milestone is a marketing number. What matters is whether the infrastructure supporting that $20 billion can handle $50 billion without breaking. The past year proved that issuance scales fast when institutions commit. The next 18 months will test whether market depth, custody rails, and regulatory frameworks can support the weight.

Investing DIV holds 50 high dividend U.S. stocks and yields over 7% with a focus on low beta names. PFF invests in preferred stocks with over 65% in financials and holds more than $14B in assets. JEPI generates over 8% yield by combining large cap U.S. stocks with options selling strategies. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. For many, investing is about staying in for the long haul, especially if you want to generate a lifetime stream of income that will support you well into retirement. To reach this goal, many savvy investors turn to dividend paying stocks. These are stocks of companies that make regular payments to investors out of their profits. But you can also turn to dividend paying ETFs. These are diversified funds that can hold hundreds of dividend paying stocks hand picked by professionals from big names like JP Morgan and Blackrock. But there are also tons of dividend paying ETFs out there. And their yields vary. Some have low yields, while others have much higher yields. So to narrow down your search, we tracked down 5 dividend ETFs that pay 5%+ yields and can have a nice spot in a long term investor’s portfolio. So let’s take a closer look. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV) is a popular dividend paying ETF among investors. It generates an impressive yield of over 7%. It does this by investing in 50 of the highest dividend paying stocks in the United States. But its fund managers go beyond just picking dividend stocks with high yields. They also screen for stocks with low betas compared to the S&P 500. This can give investors the benefit of low volatility. Moreover, the fund has net assets of over $657 million. And it’s delivered a five year return of around 2%. Plus, it also has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) invests in preferred stocks with an aim to capture returns similar to high yield bonds combined with growth potential. Preferred stocks also generally have higher yields than common stocks, making this fund popular among income seeking investors. This ETF has a large weighting in financial institutions with more than 65 percent of its holdings resting in that sector. But it also has a significant exposure to the industrial and utilities sectors. Utilities are often seen as a defensive sector, meaning it is generally known to remain resilient even in times of market downturns. Moreover, the PFF holds net assets of more than $14 billion. And it has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The Invesco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (XSHD) The XSHD invests in 60 companies in the S&P SmallCap 600 Low Volatility High Dividend Index. These stocks have generally been known to offer high yields as well as experiencing less volatility, potentially making it suitable for low risk investors. This ETF and its corresponding invex are rebalanced and reconstituted semi annually on the last business day in January and July. It generates a high yield of more than 6%. It is largely concentrated in real estate including real estate investment trusts (REITs). These are companies that invest across a variety of income generating real estate like apartments and shopping centers. And it has a slightly lower expense ratio than other funds on this list at 0.30%. Additionally, this ETF holds net assets of around $70 million. The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) functions a bit differently than other ETFs on this list. It generates income by investing in large cap U.S. stocks and selling options. It generates a yield of more than 8% and has earned a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Silver. Moreover, it screens for stocks with low volatility and uses a proprietary research strategy to find over and undervalued stocks with attractive risk/returnprofiles. The fund is highly concentrated in communications services, consumer discretionary and consumer staples. And its top holdings include some tech giants of the so called Magnificent Seven. In addition, the fund holds net assets of more than $41 billion. And it offers a competitive expense ratio of 0.35%. Those looking for international exposure may want to look into the Global X SuperDividend ETF (SDIV). This is the global cousin of DIV. And it generates an impressive yield of more than 9%.

Title: New BlackRock report exposes a historic shift in crypto that leaves only one blockchain controlling the settlement layer

Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoins used to be a crypto convenience, a way to park dollars between trades without touching fiat. However, the industry has matured enough that BlackRock now treats them as foundational rails for the market. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. It also said they could expand in cross-border transfers and day-to-day use in emerging markets. That framing matters because it shifts the question investors ask, especially when it comes from a name as big as BlackRock. The point here isn’t whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they’re on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance. If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash? BlackRock puts the stakes bluntly. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s global head of market development. They’re “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Stablecoins began thriving on crypto volatility. Markets swing, banks close on weekends, and exchanges rely on a patchwork of fiat rails for redemptions. Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset. BlackRock’s emphasis is that stablecoins have now outgrown that niche. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high. One reason the timing feels right is regulatory. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements. The law is signed, but the real fight starts in rulemaking and phased rollouts through 2026–27. Here’s the timeline, the winners, and how flows could reroute crypto rails. That kind of legal clarity doesn’t guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators. The market’s scale is also no longer theoretical. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack. BlackRock’s report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system’s primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.” That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments. Visa offered a concrete example in December 2025. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle’s dollar stablecoin. Visa said initial banking participants settled over Solana. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays. Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that’s usually invisible until it breaks: settlement. If stablecoins are now effectively digital dollars, the next question is where those dollars live as the system scales. As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle. This is where Ethereum could step in. Ethereum’s value proposition in 2026 isn’t that it’s the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. Plenty of networks compete there, and Visa’s Solana pilot is a reminder that high-throughput chains have a seat at the table. The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions. Ethereum’s own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain. So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The more valuable the activity being settled, the more valuable the referee role becomes. BlackRock’s stablecoin section is also a tokenization story. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission. Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. It means issuing a claim on a real-world asset, such as a Treasury bill fund, on a blockchain. Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading. On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026. BlackRock itself helped build that gravitational pull. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance. Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop. JPMorgan has been moving in the same direction. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum. It accepted subscriptions in cash or USDC and tied the push partly to the stablecoin regulatory shift that followed the GENIUS Act. This suggests stablecoins don’t just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance. Ethereum has become the default answer to that need, not because it wins every benchmark, but because it has become the settlement court where the most valuable cases are heard. BlackRock’s outlook includes caution embedded in the opportunity. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines. That’s a political economy problem, not a tech problem. It’s also the kind that can trigger restrictive policy responses in exactly the places where stablecoins have product-market fit. There are also issuer risks. Stablecoins aren’t all the same, and market structure can turn on trust. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether’s reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. It was a reminder that the stability of the system can hinge on what sits behind the peg. Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets. Ethereum also isn’t guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa’s USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs. Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain. But portability cuts both ways. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise. That’s why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock. In the current architecture of the crypto market, Ethereum is the bedrock most institutions keep returning to.

Title: Weekend reading: Alas Smith and the active investing Joneses

What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: Everything we know about how Wall Street's biggest firms, from JPMorgan to Blackstone, are adopting AI

Every time Michelle publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome to Wall Street's AI era. Banks, private equity firms, hedge funds, and asset managers have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers. Business Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from its potential impact on jobs and the creation of new ones, to the various ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies. But first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? AI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a "tremendous" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees. The bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains. Goldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a "limited reduction" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm. More stories:7 Goldman Sachs insiders explain how the bank's new AI sidekick is helping them crush it at work Goldman is assembling a growing arsenal of AI tools. Here's everything we know about 5. Morgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week. Citigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September. Citi snags AI leader from Morgan Stanley to help turn around its wealth tech In the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority. In December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund. At the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio. Point72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion. Bridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund. $29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings. Lucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees. Private equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market. Swedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions. As private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants. AI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows. BlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool. The multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople. Kraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work. At Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood. Chime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook. Jump to

Title: Billionaire Chase Coleman Abruptly Dumps $3,490,202,000 of Meta, Buys Tech Stock That’s Soared 2x in Six Months

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM).

Title: Abu Dhabi steel group eyes takeover of Gupta's UK empire

Arabian Gulf Steel Industries is among a small number of parties which have approached the Official Receiver about buying the UK's third-biggest steelmaker out of insolvency, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 10 January 2026 09:08, UK A UAE-based steel company has made an approach to buy Britain's third-biggest steel producer, months after it was declared "hopelessly insolvent" and fell into the hands of the Official Receiver. Sky News has learnt that Arabian Gulf Steel Industries (AGSI), which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, is among a small number of parties which have lodged proposals to take control of the Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) business which until last summer was owned by the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire. The business collapsed into compulsory liquidation in August, sparking a scramble in Whitehall to find a buyer for it as part of efforts to preserve the UK's steelmaking capabilities. The SSUK business operates sites at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, and across its operations employed close to 1,500 people when it collapsed last summer. This weekend, it was unclear how advanced any discussions were between AGSI and the Official Receiver, while the terms of any proposal were also unclear. One source suggested that AGSI might be keen to secure financial backing from Britain's National Wealth Fund to support a takeover of SSUK and fund a resumption of steelmaking at its sites in Yorkshire. AGSI describes itself on its website as "the epitome of Net Zero steel", and has pledged to produce five million tons of steel by 2030, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 95% compared to traditional steelmaking processes. The company is privately owned and run by its founder and chief executive, Asam Hussain. AGSI did not respond to an emailed request for comment, but one source expressed scepticism that it would ultimately acquire the Liberty Speciality Steels business. A number of other parties have also expressed interest in buying the operations in recent months. Mr Gupta himself had secured backing from third parties including Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, although the prospect of him being chosen to repurchase the business appears to be extremely remote. An Insolvency Service spokesperson said: "We can confirm that the Official Receiver continues to progress bids for the sale of Speciality Steel UK. "The sales process is ongoing, with the aim to complete a sale at the earliest opportunity." In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a government spokesperson said: "We remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK. "The independent Official Receiver is carrying out his duties as liquidator, while we also make sure staff and local communities are supported." The National Wealth Fund failed to respond to an enquiry from Sky News. The sale process for SSUK comes during a period of broader uncertainty for the British steel sector, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs regime and a continued global glut of the metal. In November, Sky News revealed that ministers were drafting in bankers at Evercore to conduct a review of options for the industry. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, and UK Government Investments (UKGI), the Whitehall agency which manages taxpayers' interests in a range of companies, including the Post Office and Channel 4, are expected to consider whether to merge some of the remaining companies in the sector. These would include British Steel, the Scunthorpe-based producer which is legally owned by China's Jingye Group but which was seized by the government last April amid a threat to close its remaining blast furnaces. So far, the government has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on running British Steel. The government's move prevented the immediate loss of more than 3,000 jobs, although there remain questions about the company's viability as a standalone entity. "We continue to work with Jingye to find a pragmatic, realistic solution for the future of British Steel," Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said in a statement to parliament in November. "Our long-term aspiration for the company will require co-investment with the private sector to enable modernisation and decarbonisation, safeguard taxpayers' money and retain steelmaking in Scunthorpe." In 2024, ministers agreed to provide £500m in grant funding to Tata Steel, the Indian company, to install an electric arc furnace at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. The new facility is expected to be operational in 2027, but has been bitterly opposed by trade unions infuriated that the new funding was effectively used to drive through thousands of redundancies at the plant.

Title: Teens share their views on possible social media ban

Sinéad Courtney One month ago, Australia implemented a world-first social media ban for those under the age of 16 in a bid to protect young people from harmful content. The move sparked conversation around the world with many countries, including Ireland and other EU member states, now examining whether they should follow suit. At the Stripe Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in Dublin (YSTE), we spoke to teenagers from around the country about their views on whether Ireland should adopt similar social media legislation. "It probably would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how many people would be happy about it," Ewan Coulter, aged 16, from Castletroy College in Limerick said. "They’d probably struggle a bit at the start but after that it’d be fine, after the first few months" 16-year-old Ellen O’Shea from Ursuline College in Blackrock in Dublin thinks an all-out ban is drastic. "Instead of banning it, there should be better mediation of it," she explained. "I would make some content harder to access for younger children. I believe that sometimes through media, kids can be exposed to things they don’t need to be exposed, so I do see the point in it (a ban) slightly." Ellen said social media has been a valuable tool for her when it comes to education and preparing for YSTE. "Things like developing projects, schoolwork and all that, social media has really helped me, I wouldn’t be where I am today without it," she added. As a 15-year-old, Éabha McSorley from Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin in Cork would no longer be able to use social media if a ban came in. "I think it would be a good idea. It could have positive benefits for people's mental health," she said. But Éabha would prefer to see platforms take more action to remove harmful content altogether as "then it would be a lot safer for children and teenagers to be online in the first place". Explained: Australia's social media ban for under-16s Barry Wilmot, aged 16, from Villiers School in Limerick does not believe a ban would actually stop under-16s from accessing social media. "I don’t think it would make much of a difference, especially if they were already using it prior to a ban, because there’s so many ways around these things," he explained. "I think that the amount of time it takes up from your life is a lot and there are better things you can be doing with your time, so maybe a limited use of social media or a controlled use would be better."

Round 10 being the reverse fixtures from round nine just three weeks ago, there will be a fair whiff of vengeance in the bitingly Baltic mid-winter air around the Energia All-Ireland League this weekend. After the Friday night resumption in a Dublin derby between third-placed Lansdowne and second-placed St Mary’s, the champions and festive Division 1A leaders Clontarf resume their campaign in a repeat of the recent Bateman Cup final against Ballynahinch. The Ulster side led for 67 minutes at Castle Avenue before Clontarf claimed their first Bateman Cup with a 21-16 win thanks to replacement Ivan Soroka’s late try. He now starts in the absence of Alex Usanov while Charlie Ward is recalled at tighthead and both Paul Deeny, brother of Leinster’s Brian, replaces Alex Soroka, and Luke Brady return to the backrow. Ballynahinch, who haven’t beaten Clontarf since 2020, have slipped seven points off the top-four playoff places, so their need is acute. They make just two changes, namely Quinn Armstrong at inside centre and Daniel Bennett on the wing. Fourth-placed Terenure, who lead Cork Con on points difference, are seeking to end a run of three successive defeats after their 30-24 loss to Old Belvedere last time out. They are without Joshua Kenny, who is starting for Leinster against La Rochelle, and hooker John McKee compared to the last meeting, with Aran Egan at outhalf in a reshuffled backline which is notable for the presence of ex-Munster centre Peter Sylvestre for the first time this season as he is home on holidays from Miami. John Devine is also making his Connacht debut in Montpellier, with Eddie Kelly – another former Sevens winger – replacing Kenny. Max Russell reverts to hooker, with ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey also returning. Belvo make just two changes, bringing in winger Johnny Kiely and former Ireland under-19s outhalf Donagh O’Dwyer. Con host UCD, having taken a 36-19 away win last time out in Belfield, and are boosted by the return of loosehead Mark Donnelly following his recent loan spell with Ealing Trailfinders, as well as Ireland under-20s centre Eoghan Smyth. Danny Sheehan starts at hooker and Mark Skelly comes into the backrow, while Darragh French shifts from centre to fullback. Young Munster, who sit four points further back after consecutive bonus-point wins, were due to welcome back Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn but both are now travelling with Munster to Toulon, missing the repeat Munster derby away to Nenagh Ormond. The Tipperary side, who lost 57-10 three weeks ago, welcome back Munster’s ex-Connacht centre Sean O’Brien. Division 1B leaders Old Wesley host Blackrock while in 2A, fifth-placed Corinthians host leaders Barnhall and the only other unbeaten side in the AIL, 2B leaders Galwegians, travel to Skerries. Division 1A: Lansdowne v St Mary’s College, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch, (7.30pm, Friday); Ballynahinch v Clontarf, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v UCD, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Young Munster, New Ormond Park; Terenure College v Old Belvedere, Lakelands Park. Division 1B: Instonians v City Of Armagh, Shaw’s Bridge (2pm); Dublin University v Queen’s University, College Park; Garryowen v Highfield, Dooradoyle; Old Wesley v Blackrock College, Energia Park; UCC v Naas, The Mardyle.

Title: ‘You say things and you’re not going to please everyone’: Simon Zebo embraces punditry

The last time Munster played Toulon away in the Champions Cup, two years ago this weekend, Simon Zebo was the red 15. Without a win in their opening two pool matches, Munster trailed 10-0 after 23 minutes and were skidding towards a ditch. The airbag turned out to be a pair of tries. Zebo got the second. The creative credits were shared between the outhalf and the fullback, producer and director. Zebo spotted a thin peninsula of space behind the Toulon cover and shouted at team-mate Jack Crowley to kick. His sumptuous chip greeted Zebo on the first bounce. Behind the try line Zebo was swamped by Munster players, but a photographer, Laszlo Geczo, got a clean shot of Zebo’s wild eyes and the rapture on his face. Great photographs are never silent and Zebo’s roar is the soundtrack of the picture. His top jaw and his bottom jaw are frozen at full stretch, like a hippopotamus’s. As a player this was his shtick: flashes of lightning. “The brighter the lights the better I play,” Zebo had said in an interview before the game. That was his 35th try in the Champions Cup, which put him third on the all-time list. It was also his last. By the end of that season his heart and his legs had reached a state of irreconcilable differences and Zebo retired. “I would have liked to think that I could have played another year, but definitely not two,” Zebo says now. “It wasn’t the matches. I could have played matches for another three years if it was just that. It was the weekly toll that was being taken. Getting to Saturday to play the match was getting harder and harder.” In retirement, though, the bright lights didn’t go dark. Television was drawn to him. He had charisma and knowledge of an ever-changing game and he excited a response. Not everybody was attracted to his innate bubbliness and his naked Munster bias, but that was part of his magnetism too. Television is competing for eyeballs in a bear-pit market. Broadcasters need pundits who can cut through the din. They can’t afford to serve lukewarm tea. While he was still playing, Zebo occasionally turned up in a TV studio, but this season he has been a consistent presence on Premier Sports. When Munster beat Leinster by 31-14 in Croke Park last October, Zebo’s first big outing for the station, his unbridled joy dominated the coverage. When the game finished, he was unleashed with a roving mike to conduct post-match interviews, and he didn’t try to conceal his emotion or defuse his giddiness or hide the fact that he was talking to former team-mates. What did viewers think? Nobody was ambivalent. Either you loved it or you didn’t. Before the match Zebo did a piece comparing the sides’ outhalves, Jack Crowley and Sam Prendergast. He expressed his marginal preference for Crowley with a series of cogent points that praised and criticised both players. But he made it clear how much he admired the Leinster 10. “I just want to put it on the record, Sam Prendergast is an amazing player – because there are a few Leinster crybabies in my inbox,” he said with a laugh. A post shared by Premier Sports (@premsportstv) That segment was shared on Premier Sports’ social media channels and generated nearly 1.5 million impressions, an astonishing number compared to their whistle-to-whistle TV coverage of the match, which reached a peak audience of 78,000. For every broadcaster now, the battle is on many fronts. “I’m always up for having a laugh,” Zebo says. “I want to bring that energy and just show as much personality as possible. I was never a big fan of the generic answers you were used to hearing over and over again. “I’m not afraid to show my personality. People watching want the pundits to be genuine and I think people see beyond the BS when people put up fake personas or pretend to be super polished and not have any loyalties. “I think if I was watching Man United and Man City I would want to watch people who have been in those changing rooms and understand the club, the culture, the history. “If the pundit doesn’t have that energy or connection with the club then I don’t think you will portray the energy needed for the viewer to enjoy the game. That’s where I’d be at. “I’m still trying to find my feet as well. I’m by no means any polished article. I’d love to be super comfortable, as if you were sitting down on the sofa with me watching the game. That would be the ideal scenario. “At the moment, I’m trying to be as insightful as I can and have a bit of fun with it at the same time.” Sky Sports gave up on the pretence of impartiality years ago. In their football coverage there will invariably be somebody in the studio with an affiliation to each club. Rugby was slower to go down that road. Historically, the punditry has been more urbane, as if a game bound up with such complexity required laboratory analysis. There must be a middle ground. When Leinster beat Munster by 13-8 in Thomond Park last month, Leo Cullen came to the post-match interview with a riff he had prepared about Munster having more Leinster ex-pats in their side than Limerick-born players. It was Cullen’s first television appearance as a stand-up. Though his point was made for general consumption, he aimed it at Zebo, who all of a sudden was trapped at the bottom of a ruck, taking a shoeing from a man not wearing studs. It was compelling TV and when Premier released it on their social media channels it attracted about a million impressions; their audience during their exclusive broadcast of the match had peaked at 163,000. “I had to take my medicine,” Zebo says. “As he was slagging me, I was actually counting the amount of [Munster players] who came through Leinster and I was just like, ‘I’m going to have to bite my tongue here’.” In the online world tongue-biting is not a skill much practised. “That’s always the case. I’m not afraid of them. I’ve had them all my life, don’t worry. You say things and you know you’re not going to please everyone. It’s being comfortable in your own skin and saying what you really believe anyway, regardless.” As a player that was his manifesto too: he was true to his instincts. As a rookie on Ireland’s 2012 tour of New Zealand, and a bolter picked for the first Test, he was asked in a press conference what he thought he would bring to the team? “I like to run with the ball,” Zebo said. “I like to attack a lot.” Even though he took a conventional path from Presentation Brothers College, through Cork Constitution to Munster’s academy, he successfully navigated the system without surrendering his individuality. On parallel tracks during his teenage years in Cork, Zebo continued to play hurling with Blackrock, Gaelic football with St Michaels and soccer with Avondale United. All of it fired his imagination. The hackneyed term for a player like Zebo would be “mercurial”, with all that suggests about unpredictability. That description is not always applied as a compliment. Across all team sports the tension between structure and risk is greater now than ever, and that was where Zebo pursued his career: in the febrile space between instruction and instinct, between safe and hairy. Zebo finished his career with 35 Ireland caps and the general feeling was that it left him short. When Joe Schmidt took over as Ireland coach he didn’t pick Zebo for the guts of a year. Schmidt was obsessive about structure and detail, and his successful Irish teams made very few unscripted movements. And yet, 29 of Zebo’s caps came on Schmidt’s watch, and in the last two seasons before he signed for Racing 92, he made 20 appearances for Ireland, 15 as a starter. Schmidt wasn’t blind to Zebo’s charms, but ultimately the issue was trust. When Ireland won the Six Nations in 2015, Zebo played every minute of the first four games until the last match against Scotland when he was omitted from the match day squad. That day, Zebo represented a risk that Schmidt wasn’t prepared to take. “It’s kind of hard. Joe had a game plan and it was an incredibly successful game plan. He was an incredibly successful coach, so it obviously worked. But different styles can suit different players. That doesn’t diminish Joe or his ability, but it was just my style might have better suited to Rob Penney, when he was at Munster – he was amazing. “And Rassie Erasmus as well – he was probably my best ever coach. He was the most incredibly detailed, inspirational man manager. He did everything – everything. He held the team to a standard like no other and he was by far the best for the culture around the club. He brought a family spirit to the club – he was amazing. You’d go to war for him any day. “As soon as he left Munster we were all gutted because we knew success with him was on the horizon. We were all thinking, ‘He’s definitely going to win the World Cup with South Africa’.” Moving to Racing 92 for three seasons in his late 20s ended Zebo’s international career in effect, but it satisfied his desire for adventure. The IRFU couldn’t match the offer on the table either. In 144 games in French club rugby, Zebo scored 60 tries. Racing 92 embraced the flamboyance and the risk. “It suited me brilliantly. The style of rugby I enjoyed was the French style of play. You’d love to have been still available [for Ireland]. I would love to have been rewarded for my form while I was in France. But they were just the rules in place. “I made my decision and I wouldn’t change that. In terms of experiencing the full journey [in my career] part of that was playing in the Top 14. That was very important to me. It’s something I look back on with enormous pride.” Zebo settled back in Cork with his wife Elvira and their four children. All of them are playing the sports that he did as a child. His eldest son and daughter play on an under-11 rugby team in Cork Con that Donncha O’Callaghan coaches. They all go to the same school as Peter O’Mahony’s children. Zebo plays five-a-side soccer with childhood friends who remained his best friends. His children hang out at Blackrock hurling club, just like he did at their age. His life in rugby went through so many cycles and returned him here, unharmed and unchanged. O’Callaghan tells a story about being on a players committee in Munster when Zebo broke into the first team squad. Even in that giant playground Zebo’s lust for fun was outside the norm. Eventually, somebody on the player’s committee said the smile needed to be knocked off Zebo’s face. Nobody ever managed it. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street’s crypto debate is over as banks go all-in on BTC, stablecoins, tokenized cash

Big banks aren’t debating crypto anymore — they’re building it. From tokenized cash to ETFs, Wall Street is quietly going onchain. Cointelegraph in your social feed For years, major banks treated cryptocurrency primarily as a risk to be contained. That posture is now giving way to a more deliberate form of engagement. Rather than debating crypto’s legitimacy, banks are increasingly deciding how and where to integrate it, from regulated investment products to blockchain-based payment rails. This shift is on full display in this week’s Crypto Biz. JPMorgan is extending its US dollar deposit token onto new blockchain infrastructure, signaling that tokenized cash is moving closer to production use within global banking. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is positioning itself to offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially bringing crypto investments to millions of wealth management clients. Barclays has made its first bet on stablecoin infrastructure, backing settlement rails designed to connect regulated issuers with financial institutions. And Bank of America has taken another step toward normalization by allowing advisers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Together, these moves suggest the banking sector is no longer content to watch from the sidelines. JPMorgan announced plans to issue its US dollar-denominated deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), natively on the Canton Network, marking another step by Wall Street toward production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Digital Asset, the developer of the Canton Network, and Kinexys by JPMorgan will extend JPM Coin from its existing rails onto Canton’s privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain, enabling regulated digital cash to move across interoperable networks. According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, JPM Coin, described as the first bank-issued, US dollar-denominated deposit token for institutional clients, represents a digital claim on JPMorgan’s dollar deposits and is designed to facilitate faster, more secure movement of regulated money on public blockchains. “This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is entering the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund market, with proposed products offering exposure to Bitcoin and Solana, following the strong debut of spot crypto ETFs in the United States. The bank has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two investment vehicles, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, designed to provide passive investment exposure to the performance of their underlying digital assets. If approved, the funds could be made available to more than 19 million clients within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division, significantly expanding access to crypto-linked investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have ranked among the most successful ETF launches on record, attracting substantial inflows during their first two years of trading. Momentum has continued into the new year, with renewed investor demand driving fresh inflows during the first trading sessions. London-based banking giant Barclays has made its first investment in a stablecoin-focused company, signaling traditional finance’s growing interest in digital dollar infrastructure. The bank announced an undisclosed investment in Ubyx, a US-based stablecoin clearing platform that connects regulated issuers with financial institutions to facilitate settlement and interoperability. The move also marks a notable shift for Barclays, which in recent years has publicly emphasized the risks associated with digital assets. “This investment aligns with Barclays’ approach to explore opportunities based on new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins,” the bank said in a statement. Ubyx has previously raised $10 million in seed funding, backed by Galaxy and Coinbase. The company was founded by Tony McLaughlin, a former Citibank executive. US investors may soon receive recommendations to buy Bitcoin ETFs from Bank of America’s private bank and Merrill Edge platforms, adding to evidence of Bitcoin’s growing integration into traditional finance. The bank’s chief investment office has approved coverage of four U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including products offered by Bitwise, Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale. Collectively, the funds manage more than $100 billion in Bitcoin assets. The move comes roughly a month after Bank of America reportedly advised wealth management clients to allocate 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo.

Title: BNY Rolls Out Tokenized Deposits for Near Real-Time Institutional Settlement

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BNY introduces tokenized deposit capability mirroring $55 trillion in institutional cash balances on its private blockchain for faster collateral settlement. BNY, one of the largest global financial services platforms with over $55 trillion in assets, has launched a tokenized deposit capability on its Digital Assets platform. This new feature mirrors institutional clients’ existing cash balances on a private blockchain. It enables near-real-time settlement. The service begins with collateral and margin workflows. BNY’s traditional core banking systems keep all official records in their own private blockchain. BNY launched this new service after deploying tokenization services for money market funds with Goldman Sachs, which was announced in July 2025. According to the company blog, BNY creates on-chain digital book entries that correspond 1:1 to clients’ existing demand deposit claims at the bank. It does not issue new money. BNY records these tokens on its private, permissioned blockchain, which provides a secure, internal network for authorized users. The bank maintains the legal deposits on conventional ledgers for regulatory and reporting purposes. When a client needs to meet margin calls or move collateral, participating institutions can transfer the mirrored balances on-chain in near real time. This setup aims to cut settlement frictions. It also supports an always-on operating model. According to their announcement, the system does not bypass bank supervision or existing risk controls. BREAKING: #BNY expands digital cash capabilities by enabling the on‑chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its #DigitalAssets platform via #tokenized deposits. This launch helps advance BNY’s ambitions to support programmable, on‑chain cash for institutional… pic.twitter.com/gQRiZuS0va — BNY (@BNYglobal) January 9, 2026 The rollout first targets collateral and margin workflows. Here, intraday liquidity needs and settlement timing are the greatest sources of sensitivity. Institutions shift tokenized balances across the network within seconds to meet margin requirements. They avoid reliance on legacy cut-off times or batch processes. “As institutional markets move toward always-on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,” said Carolyn Weinberg, BNY’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer. BNY is not the only company launching tokenized products. BlackRock, another major financial company, has announced that the “tokenization of all assets” has begun. It expects to tokenize more than $4.1 trillion in traditional products. Standard Chartered launched a similar tokenized deposit product in December 2025. Goldman Sachs also continually investigates and develops new tokenized products. This new institutional trend follows the big impetus set in 2025, with the development of Real World Assets (RWA). Over the last year, the real-world use cases of RWA and related projects have grown explosively. Announcements like this show that this technology will likely remain trendy in 2026.

Title: Here's What President Trump Said About Intel's CEO That's Boosting the Stock Friday

Intel's stock hit its highest point in nearly two years Friday, thanks to a social media post. The chipmaker's stock was up nearly 10% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Friday after President Trump praised Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on social media. "I just finished a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan," Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, and that the U.S. government is "proud" to be an Intel shareholder. Just a few months earlier, Trump had pushed for Lip-Bu Tan to resign amid concerns about Tan's stakes in Chinese companies. However, Trump changed his tune just days later after meeting with the CEO in August, and brokered a deal that saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel's stock has gotten a big boost from Trump's show of support, though it remains well off its historical highs as the embattled chipmaker works to convince investors of a sustainable turnaround in its business. A high-profile partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) followed not long after the government announced its stake, helped lift Intel's stock in the second half of last year, along with rumors about potential new customers. The shares nearly doubled in value last year, with most of those gains coming between early August and December. Intel's recent gains have also made the stock one of the top performers in the S&P 500 to start the year, with shares adding close to one-quarter of their value in January so far. A number of other semiconductor stocks followed Intel higher Friday, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), contributing to a broader market rally that pushed the S&P 500 to a new high.

Title: Markets wrap European stocks boosted by Glencore surge

European shares ended Friday at a record high, powered by a surge in miner Glencore. On the trade front, European Union member states confirmed a majority support a free-trade agreement with South American bloc Mercosur. Global market sentiment also received a lift as investors reacted to US labour market data. The Irish index of shares ended the week marginally higher, with gains in food and construction stocks buoying the market. But banking shares remained mixed, with AIB notching up a gain on Friday of just under 1 per cent, while Bank of Ireland fell back slightly as the week drew to a close. Among construction stocks, insulation specialist Kingspan added 2.8 per cent, while home builders Glenveagh and Cairn gained 0.9 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares shed 1.5 per cent, while ferry group ICG fell by 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip FTSE 100 recorded ⁠its second straight weekly gain and its highest ever close of ⁠10,126.6 points, marking a 0.8 per cent gain on ⁠the day. Shares in miner Glencore jumped ⁠9.6 per cent to their highest since July 2024 following news it is ‌in ​talks ‍with Rio Tinto about a takeover that would create the world’s largest mining group, valued at almost $207 billion (€178 billion). London-listed shares of Rio closed 3 per cent lower. Among other stocks, Sainsbury’s fell 5.3 per cent after Britain’s second-largest supermarket group reported a fall in general merchandise ‌and clothing sales for the Christmas quarter. IAG fell 2.7 per cent after the airline group named ⁠the finance chief of its British Airways unit, Jose Antonio Barrionuevo, as the group’s new chief financial officer, due to start in June. The STOXX 600 index climbed 1 per cent on Friday, with technology stocks leading the advance and logging their best week in nearly two years. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML added 6.8 per cent and was the biggest gainer in the tech index after HSBC raised its price target on the stock. Germany’s Infineon rose 2.4 per cent, while STMicroelectronics added 2.9 per cent. Tech shares also got a boost after upbeat fourth-quarter results from TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. Shares in Anglo American rose 2.7 per cent, a day after a filing from the European Commission showed that the miner’s deal with Canada’s Teck Resources is heading for antitrust clearance in Europe. Defence stocks led weekly advances, with a near 10 per cent gain – their best showing since November 2020 – after US president Donald Trump called for higher defence spending. The retail rout carried on from the previous session. Pandora warned of weaker 2025 sales growth, sending shares of the jewellery maker down 13 per cent. US equities rose on Friday to new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index climbing 0.5 per cent at 11.30am in New York, on pace for its second closing high of 2026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rallied 0.8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent. In the consumer sector, Mattel slid 3.27 per cent and Nike more than 1 per cent. Traders were also parsing job numbers. US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, suggesting the labour market continued to soften at year-end, data released earlier in the day showed. The report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting but left the door open for cuts later in the year. On the corporate side, Meta Platforms agreed to a series of electricity deals to power data centres that will make it the biggest buyer of nuclear power among its hyperscaler peers. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are up after the company reported strong December sales. Qualcomm shares were down after Mizuho Securities downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from outperform. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin’s next super rally could depend on this key data point

Long-term Bitcoin holders sold nearly $300 billion worth of BTC in 2025, but as this sell pressure declines, a bullish outlook for 2026 has emerged. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan.11, 2026, 7.35 UTC): This article has been updated to correct the LTH supply figure to 13.6 million BTC. Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) went through one of the most aggressive distribution phases on record in 2025. While the scale of selling rattled the market, onchain data analysis suggests that this pressure may be fading, possibly outlining the next bullish period for BTC price. Key takeaways: Long-term holders distributed about $300 billion in BTC in 2025, marking a historic supply reset. Heavy LTH selling has occurred near cycle peaks or during structural transitions, not at the start of new downtrends. With selling pressure stalling, the next phase may hinge on how early the long-term holder supply stabilizes. An amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that had remained unmoved for at least two years moved onchain sharply in 2025. Nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year re-entered circulation. The 30 days from Nov. 15 to Dec. 14, 2025, marked one of the heaviest long-term holder (LTH) distribution periods in more than five years. Since 2019, sharp declines in long-term holder (LTH) supply have rarely appeared in isolation. They have surfaced during phases when Bitcoin’s trend was already under strain, either approaching exhaustion or undergoing a structural shift. In 2018, the LTH supply fell to 12 million BTC from 13 million, with selling intensity peaking when the 30-day distribution reached 1.08 million BTC in December. At that point, Bitcoin had already spent months declining. Price bottomed near $3,500 in February 2019, before stabilizing and rallying to $11,000 by mid-year, illustrating how heavy LTH selling could precede recovery rather than mark its end. The 2020–2021 cycle unfolded differently. LTH supply dropped to 11.65 million BTC from 13.7 million BTC, while Bitcoin price rose to $61,000 from $14,000. The 30-day distribution peak of 891,000 BTC did not immediately halt the rally. Instead, selling persisted as prices rose, gradually eroding upside momentum before the cycle ultimately rolled over, a reminder that LTH distribution can accompany expansion before defining its limits. During the 2024–2025 bull run, supply declined to 14.5 million BTC from 15.8 million BTC, with the 30-day distribution peaking at 758,000 BTC. Price topped slightly earlier in March, and both metrics then moved sideways through Q2–Q3, reinforcing a familiar pattern: Price strength tends to fade as long-term holders step up distribution. The final phase in mid-to-late 2025 proved more abrupt. LTH supply briefly recovered to 15.4 million BTC in June, before collapsing to 13.5 million BTC by December, the sharpest decline on record. Price weakness appeared in October, but the most selling followed later, with the largest-ever 30-day distribution peak of 1.14 million BTC in November. That sequence suggests capitulation rather than orderly profit-taking, marking a reset rather than a continuation of the prior trend. Related: Bitcoin RSI hints at $105K BTC price rebound as bull signals multiply Since December, the LTH supply has stopped falling, currently around 13.6 million BTC, while Bitcoin has entered a sideways range. Additional confirmation comes from the long-term/short-term holder supply ratio. Every time this ratio has fallen to –0.5 or below, Bitcoin has either entered a base-building phase or rallied to new highs within weeks. In December, the ratio dropped to about -0.53, after which price volatility compressed and momentum stalled, consistent with a reset rather than trend continuation. Thus this combination, aggressive distribution followed by supply stabilization, has historically marked transition phases rather than trend continuation. If the trend repeats, the consolidation through Q1to Q2 could act as a base-building period, with any sustained rally more likely to emerge later, potentially into Q3.

In a blog post, the institution co-founded by Alexander Hamilton described the move as a key step in bolstering its ability to move “programmable, on‑chain cash” across digital rails. The product is powered by the bank’s private and permissioned blockchain, BNY added. The product is for both institutions and “digital natives,” it added. BNY described its tokenized deposits as digital book entries representing funds that participating clients would be able to withdraw through traditional means. The bank said the tokens will initially be used in circumstances related to collateral and margin. The move underscored how Wall Street incumbents are increasingly using digital assets as a way to augment their existing businesses. BNY highlighted the ability of tokenized deposits to “reduce settlement friction” and “improve liquidity efficiency” in various settings. The company noted that clients’ balances, although they will be represented on-chain, will continue to be recorded with BNY’s traditional systems for compliance purposes. In a statement, BNY Chief Product and Innovation Officer Carolyn Weinberg underscored the trusted nature of the institution’s bank deposits. The bank, which has existed for more than 240 years, safeguarded $57.8 trillion in assets on behalf of clients, as of September. The New York-based behemoth also has $2.1 trillion in assets under management. As competitors like JPMorgan expand tokenized deposits to various networks, BNY said that its version of the product will serve as “the connective tissue of BNY’s digital infrastructure,” which includes a tokenized money-market fund with Goldman Sachs that was unveiled in July. After forming its digital assets unit in 2021, the company started managing private keys for clients the following year, with the debut of custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNY’s blog post included statements from around a dozen crypto-native firms, including crypto bank Anchorage Digital, stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, BlackRock-backed tokenization specialist Securitize, and Ripple’s institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. “BNY taking this step to enable tokenized deposits is a milestone moment for digital cash adoption,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said. Citadel Securities, which said in July that it accounts for 25% of U.S. equity volume, also described tokenization as crucial for the future of finance. The market-making giant's CEO, Ken Griffin, had in 2021 called crypto a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar.

Amazon shares dipped as reports confirmed the retail giant may slash 30,000 corporate roles by May 2026. This follow-up to the 14,000 cuts in late 2025 targets 10% of its white-collar staff. The move aims to eliminate "managerial bloat" and fund a $100 billion AI pivot. While trading at $245.98, the stock faces pressure as internal documents suggest 600,000 workers could eventually be replaced by automation by 2033.

The tech industry saw an estimated 245,000 jobs lost globally in 2025, with the US accounting for the majority of layoffs. Factors such as post-pandemic overhiring corrections and increased AI adoption are driving companies to reduce headcount. Every industry faces job cuts, especially in tumultuous economic times, new technologies replacing existing jobs, and so on. Unfortunately, it looks like the tech sector is experiencing global layoffs, with an estimation of nearly 245,000 jobs lost in 2025 alone. According to a recent report from RationalFX, they estimated that about 245,000 people experienced layoffs on a global scale in the tech sector in 2025. Based on their figures, the US was the most affected, with a little over 170,000 jobs lost. This accounts for approximately 69.7% of all global tech layoffs in 2025. The largest contributor to this was Intel. At the end of 2024, the company employed about 109,000 people, but it later revealed plans to drop those figures down further to 75,000 in 2025. Other tech companies also experienced similar layoffs. This includes Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, IBM, HP, and Salesforce, just to name a few. India also experienced pretty big layoffs, with an estimated 19,000 jobs lost in 2025. This was followed by Japan at a little over 11,000, Ireland, and Switzerland, rounding out the top five countries with the biggest layoffs. So, what’s happening, and why are jobs in the tech sector getting cut? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, RationalFX suggests that this is part of a post-pandemic correction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while jobs were lost, there were a lot of jobs created as well. This is due to a rise in demand for work-from-home solutions, entertainment, food delivery, and so on. However, following the end of the pandemic, many tech companies realized they had overhired and are working towards correcting that. Another reason why we’re seeing jobs cut is because of, you guessed it, AI. AI allows users to automate and complete tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken a human hours, days, or weeks. This means that companies can dump massive reports into AI and get summaries almost instantly. They can also use it to generate reports, make predictions, and identify patterns. This makes certain positions redundant. We’re also seeing how AI can generate impressive images and videos with a few simple prompts. But this isn’t necessarily doom and gloom. Like they say, when a door closes, another opens. When smartphones were created, suddenly being an app developer became a more viable career. Thanks to social media, being a content creator is also now a career for some. We’re not sure what the future holds for jobs in the tech sector, so we’ll have to wait and see.

Title: Are Leaders Responsible for Employee Wellbeing?
URL: https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/are-leaders-responsible-for-employee-wellbeing
Time Published: 2026-01-09T15:43:54Z
Full Content:
Work is increasingly understood as a powerful driver of wellbeing, and wellbeing as a factor shaping how organizations perform and endure. We asked Yale SOM leadership expert David Tate how leaders can create environments that support wellbeing without sacrificing rigor, accountability, or results. Has there been a shift in understanding of the relationship between work and wellbeing? Is more expected of leaders now? Yes, there has been a notable shift in how scholars and practitioners view the connection between work and wellbeing. Historically, work was seen primarily as a source of economic security and identity, with wellbeing considered a secondary outcome or the personal responsibility of the worker. Contemporary research, however, emphasizes that work is a significant determinant of psychological, emotional, and physical health and that the organizational environment profoundly influences employee wellbeing. Meta-analyses show that poor work conditions—high workload, low control, and limited social support—are associated with elevated risks of burnout, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders (Kivimäki et al., 2015). Conversely, positive work experiences, meaningful work, and supportive leadership are linked to greater engagement, satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. These insights have reshaped expectations for leaders. Modern leadership is increasingly understood not only as driving results but also as cultivating environments that support employee wellbeing. Leaders are expected to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy and to be aware of how organizational practices affect psychological health (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2013). Organizations are increasingly integrating employee wellbeing and psychological safety into strategic priorities, with leaders and executives explicitly accountable for creating conditions that support learning, engagement, and sustainable high performance (Edmondson, 2019; Gallup, 2023). The emergence of chief wellbeing officers and wellbeing dashboards illustrates that wellbeing is no longer solely an individual responsibility but a leadership and organizational concern (Grabarek & Sawyer, 2025). How can leaders pay attention to the wellbeing of employees and still be rigorous and high-performing? Leaders can support wellbeing while maintaining high performance by embedding wellbeing into the very definition of organizational success. Empirical research shows that workplaces emphasizing employee wellbeing often achieve superior outcomes, including higher engagement, lower turnover, improved innovation, and stronger financial performance (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; De Neve & Ward, 2025). Effective strategies include: Importantly, leaders should maintain high standards of rigor while making it clear that it should not come at the expense of personal health or ethical behavior. Evidence suggests that teams led by emotionally intelligent leaders who balance accountability with care are more resilient and productive over time (Cherniss, 2010; O’Boyle et al., 2011). What role should wellbeing play in performance management and feedback conversations? How do you draw the line between being supportive and being intrusive as a leader? Wellbeing should be an integral component of performance management, framed in ways that support rather than monitor employees. Research indicates that employees perform better when leaders attend to both technical and human aspects of work (Grawitch et al., 2006; Grant, Christianson, & Price, 2007). Best practices include: The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. Respecting personal autonomy and confidentiality is critical. Leaders should maintain curiosity, empathy, and transparency while staying within professional boundaries (Edmondson, 2019; Kulik et al., 2016). Integrating wellbeing into performance management enhances engagement, reduces burnout, and promotes sustainable performance. When framed appropriately, wellbeing is a powerful lever for high performance rather than a distraction from it.

Investing A change at the top of the Federal Reserve could pave the way for more rate cuts in 2026. After three rate cuts in 2025, investors could see two more in 2026. Quality high-yield companies like the Small Dogs of the Dow could rule in 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © marekuliasz / iStock via Getty Images The Dogs of the Dow is a well-known strategy first published in 1991 by Michael O’Higgins. The plan aims to maximize investment returns by purchasing the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year. The highest-yielding stocks are also the lowest-priced stocks in the venerable average, as the lower a stock (or bond) is priced, the higher the attached yield or coupon becomes. Since the turn of the century, the Dogs of the Dow have outperformed the overall Dow, and the Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five highest-yielding stocks, even more so. The fact that investors are buying the highest-yielding companies in the venerable index improves the chances for total return gains. From 2000 through the early 2020s, the Dogs strategy posted strong average annual returns, generally beating the Dow by a few percentage points over the entire period. The plan is not foolproof; it struggled during the dot-com bust (early 2000s) and the tech-driven growth surge post-pandemic (2020 to 2021), when growth stocks soared, and value stocks lagged. They also lagged in 2025 as the AI-driven rally continued for the third straight year. The Dogs often shine in tough markets (like 2008 or 2022), protecting investor capital much better than the broader market by holding stable, high-yielding blue-chip companies. This makes them an excellent choice for Baby Boomers seeking safety and passive income. While the AI/data center rally has pushed stocks and indices to all-time highs, and it could still be a force in 2026, the reality is that the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is expensive. It trades at 31 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings. With the midterm elections on the way this year, investors can expect some heightened volatility. So, the Small Dogs may be the perfect play for 2026 for growth and income investors wary of a major sell-off. alexei_tm / iStock via Getty Images Dividend stocks like the Small Dogs of the Dow offer investors a reliable source of passive income. Passive income is characterized by its ability to generate revenue without requiring the earner’s continuous active effort, making it a desirable financial strategy for those seeking to diversify their income streams or achieve financial independence. The following are the Small Dogs of the Dow. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that continues to offer tremendous value. It trades at 9.13 times its estimated 2026 earnings and pays a 6.72% dividend. Verizon provides a range of communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and government entities worldwide. Verizon’s trailing 12-month interest coverage ratio is 4.6× to 5.0×, providing ample cushion for dividend payments. With a very predictable revenue stream from telecom services, the company has less exposure to commodity cycles. In addition, the large scale helps in financing and absorbing shocks. It operates in two segments: The Consumer segment provides wireless services across the United States through Verizon and TracFone networks, as well as through wholesale and other arrangements. It also provides fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through its wireless networks and related equipment and devices, such as: The segment also offers wireline services in the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States through its fiber-optic network, Verizon Fios product portfolio, and copper-based network. The Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including: Network access services to deliver various IoT services and products to businesses, government customers, and wireless and wireline carriers in the United States and internationally. TD Cowen has a Buy rating and a $51 price target on the stock. This American multinational energy company, primarily focused on oil and gas, is a safer option for investors looking to position themselves in the energy sector. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) pays a substantial 4.34% dividend, which it raised by 5% earlier this year. This integrated giant operates energy and chemicals businesses worldwide and offers investors excellent credit ratings (AA), diversified operations, strong margins, and a long history of paying and raising dividends yearly. Its Upstream segment is involved in the following: The Downstream segment engages in: It also involves cash management, debt financing, insurance operations, real estate, and technology businesses. Chevron announced in late 2023 that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hess in an all-stock transaction valued at $53 billion. The transaction’s total enterprise value, including debt, is $60 billion. The deal closed last July, providing a solid boost to Chevron’s third-quarter earnings, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating with a huge $196 target price. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biological therapies, and animal health products. It is not just a healthcare company but a global force in the industry. This healthcare giant is a no-brainer, down over 30% over the past year while paying a solid 3.02% dividend. The company operates through two segments. The Pharmaceutical segment offers human health pharmaceutical products in: The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, health management solutions and services, as well as digitally connected identification, traceability, and monitoring products. Merck serves: Merck’s growth is a result of its efforts and strategic collaborations. The company works with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eisai, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and Gilead Sciences to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting HIV treatments, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and growth. BMO Capital Markets’ target price for the Outperform-rated shares is a massive $130. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was founded more than 185 years ago as a soap-and-candle company. It has paid dividends to shareholders since 1891, raised them for 70 straight years, and currently has a 2.95% dividend yield. The company focuses on providing branded consumer packaged goods worldwide. Segments include: The company’s products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, including social commerce channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores, including airport duty-free stores, high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores, and professional channels. It also sells directly to individual consumers. It has operations in approximately 70 countries. Procter & Gamble offers products under such brands as: Jefferies has a Buy rating with a $179 target price. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide. This biotech giant remains a top stock for investors to buy, offering a safer investment with a 2.75% dividend yield to capitalize on the massive growth potential of biosimilars. Amgen focuses on: The company’s products include: HSBC has a huge $425 target price and a Buy rating. Our Top 2026 Passive Income Ultra-High-Yield Picks With Up to 10% Dividends.

Title: Historical Data Tells Why Bitcoin Might Record a Parabolic Run in Q1 2026
URL: https://zycrypto.com/historical-data-tells-why-bitcoin-might-record-a-parabolic-run-in-q1-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-09T13:36:27Z
Full Content:
Historical performance patterns are shaping expectations of a strong first quarter for Bitcoin, especially following a muted year that preceded it. Data shows that Q1 has treated Bitcoin well, even in extreme bear market conditions. Since the negative first quarter of 2018, subsequent Q1 periods have delivered relatively resilient returns, even in the notoriously bearish 2022. After more than a month of sideways movement, price action has settled into a clearly defined channel that resembles an accumulation range rather than a continuation of a broader downtrend. The persistence of this range strengthens the probability that a local bottom has already formed. Market observers note that a decisive break above the $94,500 level could quickly unlock momentum, putting the psychologically critical $100,000 mark back firmly in focus. For further context, Bitcoin’s recent technical behavior is drawing comparisons to gold’s 2018 cycle. Gold at that time spent months bleeding lower within a falling wedge before breaking out, briefly retesting support, and then entering a powerful price discovery phase. Bitcoin has now exited a similar wedge formation, suggesting a comparable sequence may unfold. A shallow pullback followed by renewed upside would fit neatly into this historical analogue, and potentially accelerate sentiment as the year progresses. However, near-term flows are mixed. Recent data shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows late in December, with products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark, and 21Shares recording redemptions. On December 26 alone, IBIT, FBTC, and GBTC collectively saw outflows exceeding $589 million, followed by another round of redemptions on December 31, led again by IBIT. Additional funds, including BITB, HODL, BTCO, and EZBC, also posted weekly outflows. Despite this, the overall narrative is intact. Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory balances institutional demand through reserves and ETFs with ongoing technical evolution, including Layer 2 development and preparations for post-quantum security. If historical Q1 tendencies align with improving structure and macro liquidity, the conditions for a parabolic move may already be forming.

Radar > Topics > AI & ML The tech trends we’re watching in the new year By Julie Baron January 9, 2026 • 13 minute read We’re three years into a post-ChatGPT world, and AI remains the focal point of the tech industry. In 2025, several ongoing trends intensified: AI investment accelerated; enterprises integrated agents and workflow automation at a faster pace; and the toolscape for professionals seeking a career edge is now overwhelmingly expansive. But the jury’s still out on the ROI from the vast sums that have saturated the industry. We anticipate that 2026 will be a year of increased accountability. Expect enterprises to shift focus from experimentation to measurable business outcomes and sustainable AI costs. There are promising productivity and efficiency gains to be had in software engineering and development, operations, security, and product design, but significant challenges also persist. Bigger picture, the industry is still grappling with what AI is and where we’re headed. Is AI a worker that will take all our jobs? Is AGI imminent? Is the bubble about to burst? Economic uncertainty, layoffs, and shifting AI hiring expectations have undeniably created stark career anxiety throughout the industry. But as Tim O’Reilly pointedly argues, “AI is not taking jobs: The decisions of people deploying it are.” No one has quite figured out how to make money yet, but the organizations that succeed will do so by creating solutions that “genuinely improve. . .customers’ lives.” That won’t happen by shoehorning AI into existing workflows but by first determining where AI can actually improve upon them, then taking an “AI first” approach to developing products around these insights. As Tim O’Reilly and Mike Loukides recently explained, “At O’Reilly, we don’t believe in predicting the future. But we do believe you can see signs of the future in the present.” We’re watching a number of “possible futures taking shape.” AI will undoubtedly be integrated more deeply into industries, products, and the wider workforce in 2026 as use cases continue to be discovered and shared. Topics we’re keeping tabs on include context engineering for building more reliable, performant AI systems; LLM posttraining techniques, in particular fine-tuning as a means to build more specialized, domain-specific models; the growth of agents, as well as the protocols, like MCP, to support them; and computer vision and multimodal AI more generally to enable the development of physical/embodied AI and the creation of world models. Here are some of the other trends that are pointing the way forward. In 2025, AI was embedded in software developers’ everyday work, transforming their roles—in some cases dramatically. A multitude of AI tools are now available to create code, and workflows are undergoing a transformation shaped by new concepts including vibe coding, agentic development, context engineering, eval- and spec-driven development, and more. In 2026, we’ll see an increased focus on agents and the protocols, like MCP, that support them; new coding workflows; and the impact of AI on assisting with legacy code. But even as software development practices evolve, fundamental skills such as code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation are as vital as ever. And despite major disruption from GenAI, programming languages aren’t going anywhere. Type-safe languages like TypeScript, Java, and C# provide compile-time validation that catches AI errors before production, helping mitigate the risks of AI-generated code. Memory safety mandates will drive interest in Rust and Zig for systems programming: Major players such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have adopted Rust for critical systems, and Zig is behind Anthropic’s most recent acquisition, Bun. And Python is central to creating powerful AI and machine learning frameworks, driving complex intelligent automation that extends far beyond simple scripting. It’s also ideal for edge computing and robotics, two areas where AI is likely to make inroads in the coming year. Which AI tools programmers use matter less than how they use them. With a wide choice of tools now available in the IDE and on the command line, and new options being introduced all the time, it’s useful to focus on the skills needed to produce good code rather than focusing on the tool itself. After all, whatever tool they use, developers are ultimately responsible for the code it produces. Effectively communicating with AI models is the key to doing good work. The more background AI tools are given about a project, the better the code they generate will be. Developers have to understand both how to manage what the AI knows about their project (context engineering) and how to communicate it (prompt engineering) to get useful outputs. AI isn’t just a pair programmer; it’s an entire team of developers. Software engineers have moved beyond single coding assistants. They’re building and deploying custom agents, often within complex setups involving multi-agent scenarios, teams of coding agents, and agent swarms. But as the engineering workflow shifts from conducting AI to orchestrating AI, the fundamentals of building and maintaining good software—code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation—stay the same and will be what elevates purposeful AI-assisted code above the crowd. AI has progressed from being something architects might have to consider to something that is now essential to their work. They can use LLMs to accelerate or optimize architecture tasks; they can add AI to existing software systems or use it to modernize those systems; and they can design AI-native architectures, an approach that requires new considerations and patterns for system design. And even if they aren’t working with AI (yet), architects still need to understand how AI relates to other parts of their system and be able to communicate their decisions to stakeholders at all levels. AI-enhanced and AI-native architectures bring new considerations and patterns for system design. Event-driven models can enable AI agents to act on incoming triggers rather than fixed prompts. In 2026, evolving architectures will become more important as architects look for ways to modernize existing systems for AI. And the rise of agentic AI means architects need to stay up-to-date on emerging protocols like MCP. Many of the concerns from 2025 will carry over into the new year. Considerations such as incorporating LLMs and RAG into existing architectures, emerging architecture patterns and antipatterns specifically for AI systems, and the focus on API and data integrations elevated by MCP are critical. The fundamentals still matter. Tools and frameworks are making it possible to automate more tasks. However, to successfully leverage these capabilities to design sustainable architecture, enterprise architects must have a full command of the principles behind them: when to add an agent or a microservice, how to consider cost, how to define boundaries, and how to act on the knowledge they already have. The InfraOps space is undergoing its most significant transformation since cloud computing, as AI evolves from a workload to be managed to an active participant in managing infrastructure itself. With infrastructure sprawling across multicloud environments, edge deployments, and specialized AI accelerators, manual management is becoming nearly impossible. In 2026, the industry will keep moving toward self-healing systems and predictive observability—infrastructure that continuously optimizes itself, shifting the human role from manual maintenance to system oversight, architecture, and long-term strategy. Platform engineering makes this transformation operational, abstracting infrastructure complexity behind self-service interfaces, which lets developers deploy AI workloads, implement observability, and maintain security without deep infrastructure expertise. The best platforms will evolve into orchestration layers for autonomous systems. While fully autonomous systems remain on the horizon, the trajectory is clear. AI is becoming a primary driver of infrastructure architecture. AI-native workloads demand GPU orchestration at scale, specialized networking protocols optimized for model training and inference, and frameworks like Ray on Kubernetes that can distribute compute intelligently. Organizations are redesigning infrastructure stacks to accommodate these demands and are increasingly considering hybrid environments and alternatives to hyperscalers to power their AI workloads—“neocloud” platforms like CoreWeave, Lambda, and Vultr. AI is augmenting the work of operations teams with real-time intelligence. Organizations are turning to AIOps platforms to predict failures before they cascade, identify anomalies humans would miss, and surface optimization opportunities in telemetry data. These systems aim to amplify human judgment, giving operators superhuman pattern recognition across complex environments. AI is evolving into an autonomous operator that makes its own infrastructure decisions. Companies will implement emerging “agentic SRE” practices: systems that reason about infrastructure problems, form hypotheses about root causes, and take independent corrective action, replicating the cognitive workload that SREs perform, not just following predetermined scripts. The big story of the back half of 2025 was agents. While the groundwork has been laid, in 2026 we expect focus on the development of agentic systems to persist—and this will necessitate new tools and techniques, particularly on the data side. AI and data platforms continue to converge, with vendors like Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce releasing products to help customers build and deploy agents. Beyond agents, AI is making its influence felt across the entire data stack, as data professionals target their workflows to support enterprise AI. Significant trends include real-time analytics, enhanced data privacy and security, and the increasing use of low-code/no-code tools to democratize data access. Sustainability also remains a concern, and data professionals need to consider ESG compliance, carbon-aware tooling, and resource-optimized architectures when designing for AI workloads. Data infrastructure continues to consolidate. The consolidation trend has not only affected the modern data stack but also more traditional areas like the database space. In response, organizations are being more intentional about what kind of databases they deploy. At the same time, modern data stacks have fragmented across cloud platforms and open ecosystems, so engineers must increasingly design for interoperability. A multiple database approach is more important than ever. Vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, and Weaviate help power agentic AI—while they’re a new technology, companies are beginning to adopt vector databases more widely. DuckDB’s popularity is growing for running analytical queries. And even though it’s been around for a while, ClickHouse, an open source distributed OLAP database used for real-time analytics, has finally broken through with data professionals. The infrastructure to support autonomous agents is coming together. GitOps, observability, identity management, and zero-trust orchestration will all play key roles. And we’re following a number of new initiatives that facilitate agentic development, including AgentDB, a database designed specifically to work effectively with AI agents; Databricks’ recently announced Lakebase, a Postgres database/OLTP engine integrated within the data lakehouse; and Tiger Data’s Agentic Postgres, a database “designed from the ground up” to support agents. AI is a threat multiplier—59% of tech professionals cited AI-driven cyberthreats as their biggest concern in a recent survey. In response, the cybersecurity analyst role is shifting from low-level human-in-the-loop tasks to complex threat hunting, AI governance, advanced data analysis and coding, and human-AI teaming oversight. But addressing AI-generated threats will also require a fundamental transformation in defensive strategy and skill acquisition—and the sooner it happens, the better. Security professionals now have to defend a broader attack surface. The proliferation of AI agents expands the attack surface. Security tools must evolve to protect it. Implementing zero trust for machine identities is a smart opening move to mitigate sprawl and nonhuman traffic. Security professionals must also harden their AI systems against common threats such as prompt injection and model manipulation. Organizations are struggling with governance and compliance. Striking a balance between data utility and vulnerability requires adherence to data governance best practices (e.g., least privilege). Government agencies, industry and professional groups, and technology companies are developing a range of AI governance frameworks to help guide organizations, but it’s up to companies to translate these technical governance frameworks into board-level risk decisions and actionable policy controls. The security operations center (SOC) is evolving. The velocity and scale of AI-driven attacks can overwhelm traditional SIEM/SOAR solutions. Expect increased adoption of agentic SOC—a system of specialized, coordinated AI agents for triage and response. This shifts the focus of the SOC analyst from reactive alert triage to proactive threat hunting, complex analysis, and AI system oversight. Business focus in 2025 shifted from scattered AI experiments to the challenge of building defensible, AI-native businesses. Next year we’re likely to see product teams moving from proof of concept to proof of value. One thing to look for: Design and product responsibilities may consolidate under a “product builder”—a full stack generalist in product, design, and engineering who can rapidly build, validate, and launch new products. Companies are currently hiring for this role, although few people actually possess the full skill set at the moment. But regardless of whether product builders become ascendant, product folks in 2026 and beyond will need the ability to combine product validation, good-enough engineering, and rapid design, all enabled by AI as a core accelerator. We’re already seeing the “product manager” role becoming more technical as AI spreads throughout the product development process. Nearly all PMs use AI, but they’ll increasingly employ purpose-built AI workflows for research, user-testing, data analysis, and prototyping. Companies need to bridge the AI product strategy gap. Most companies have moved past simple AI experiments but are now facing a strategic crisis. Their existing product playbooks (how to size markets, roadmapping, UX) weren’t designed for AI-native products. Organizations must develop clear frameworks for building a portfolio of differentiated AI products, managing new risks, and creating sustainable value. AI product evaluation is now mission-critical. As AI becomes a core product component and strategy matures, rigorous evaluation is the key to turning products that are good on paper into those that are great in production. Teams should start by defining what “good” means for their specific context, then build reliable evals for models, agents, and conversational UIs to ensure they’re hitting that target. Design’s new frontier is conversations and interactions. Generative AI has pushed user experience beyond static screens into probabilistic new multimodal territory. This means a harder shift toward designing nonlinear, conversational systems, including AI agents. In 2026, we’re likely to see increased demand for AI conversational designers and AI interaction designers to devise conversation flows for chatbots and even design a model’s behavior and personality. While big questions about AI remain unanswered, the best way to plan for uncertainty is to consider the real value you can create for your users and for your teams themselves right now. The tools will improve, as they always do, and the strategies to use them will grow more complex. Being deeply versed in the core knowledge of your area of expertise gives you the foundation you’ll need to take advantage of these quickly evolving technologies—and ensure that whatever you create will be built on bedrock, not shaky ground.

2026 is just getting started, and layoffs are already underway. Companies, including Angi, the company formerly known as Angie's List, and the popular web tool Tailwind, have cut staff, citing the impact of artificial intelligence among the reasons for the layoffs. More than 100 other companies, from Amazon to Nike to Verizon, have filed legally mandated WARN notices about job cuts to come in 2026, according to WARN Tracker. Some of the cuts are part of previously announced reductions. This year's cuts follow three years of significant workforce reductions across a broad range of industries, including tech, media, finance, and retail. The moves come as artificial intelligence, public policy, and broader economic conditions present sweeping changes to the business landscape. A World Economic Forum survey last year found that some 41% of companies worldwide expected to reduce their workforces in the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. The survey also found that jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030. Last year, Business Insider tracked layoffs at around 65 major companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Paramount, and Starbucks. In 2026, we'll continue to track additional job cuts based on company announcements, WARN notices, and our own reporting. Here are the companies with job cuts underway in 2026, listed in alphabetical order. Angi, the popular contractor listing site once known as Angie's List, said in January that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In a January 7 SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Tailwind, a popular web tool, said it cut three of its four engineers in January, citing an AI-driven decline in revenue. "75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business," CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment on January 6 that made waves in the tech community.

Title: Nvidia (NVDA) Stock: Poaching Google's Marketing Leader Signals New Strategy - CoinCentral

Nvidia made a key leadership move Thursday by hiring its first chief marketing officer. The company tapped Google Cloud marketing veteran Alison Wagonfeld for the newly created position. NVIDIA Corporation, NVDA Wagonfeld announced her departure from Google on LinkedIn. She will join Nvidia in late January after spending nearly a decade at the search giant. At Google, Wagonfeld led marketing for the cloud computing business. She worked closely with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. Her new role at Nvidia consolidates marketing responsibilities that were previously split among several people. She will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang. The hire comes as Nvidia looks to expand beyond just chip sales. The company wants to position itself as a full AI platform provider offering software, systems, and services. Wagonfeld’s move from Google to Nvidia highlights the relationship between the two tech companies. “I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She emphasized that Google and Nvidia maintain a strong partnership. The two companies plan to continue their collaboration despite her switch. This partnership angle matters for investors. Some analysts have worried about competition from Google’s Tensor Processing Units potentially eating into Nvidia’s dominance. Signs of cooperation rather than rivalry could ease these concerns. The market may view Wagonfeld’s hire as confirmation that the two companies see themselves as partners rather than enemies. Nvidia stock fell 2.2% during Thursday’s trading session. Shares remained flat in after-hours trading following the announcement. The stock has struggled to break out recently. It’s down 1% over the past three months despite strong demand indicators for AI chips. Nvidia remains the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips. But the stock has been range-bound for several months as investors digest its rapid gains from earlier periods. The company faces questions about maintaining its market leadership as competitors ramp up their own chip offerings. Google’s TPUs represent one potential challenge to Nvidia’s position. Wagonfeld brings deep experience in marketing complex technology products to enterprise customers. Her background at Google Cloud could help Nvidia refine its messaging as it expands beyond hardware. The appointment reflects Nvidia’s evolution from a chip company to a broader AI infrastructure provider. Creating a CMO role signals the company’s intent to strengthen its brand and market positioning during this transition.

Title: Should You Use the New Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds?

Learn to make your money work as hard as you, so you can focus on your patients, your family, and your own wellness. Quick Start Page Recommended Professionals Financial Boot Camp Since mid-2024, BlackRock has been offering lifecycle-style ETFs that include an income annuity as part of the mix of assets. Now, it looks like Vanguard wants to get in on the action, announcing in December 2025 a new series of target retirement funds called Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. You should know two things about the Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. The first is that this is a new series of funds. We're not talking about all of Vanguard's target retirement funds that were introduced in 2003. Totally different funds. I have no idea why Vanguard used such a similar name, but there will be substantial confusion—especially since the existing target retirement funds include one that is called Target Retirement Income Fund. The key difference is the word “lifetime” in the title. The second thing is that these funds will only be available in employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. That seems kind of silly, so hopefully that's a temporary thing. The reason it's silly is that when people leave their employers to retire (i.e., the time when an immediate annuity of some kind actually makes sense), they usually roll their 401(k) or 403(b) money to an IRA to allow for more control, more investing options, and often lower fees. Now there's an option available in the 401(k) but not the IRA? What a pain. Perhaps the reason these funds will be a 401(k)-only option is because they are not actually mutual funds. They are Collective Investment Trusts (CITs). Here is an excerpt from a future WCI post on CITs, currently scheduled for publication in March 2026: A CIT is a mutual fund alternative that only exists inside qualified retirement plans, like your 401(k). It's best to just consider it the same thing as a mutual fund, but there are a few minor differences, none of which are really bad. Google lists them well: Bottom line, sometimes CITs are put into 401(k)s instead of mutual funds because they're slightly cheaper. Most of them are index funds or lifecycle-style balanced funds, which is generally a good thing for 401(k) participants. However, because they don't have ticker symbols like mutual funds and stocks, CITs can be a little harder to research on the internet (such as Morningstar and similar resources). More frequently you'll just have to obtain and review the information provided by Human Resources at your company or the 401(k) provider to learn more about the investments. The plan for Vanguard is for these new target retirement funds to look like the older ones, at least until you hit the age of 55. Then, it'll start replacing some of the assets with an immediate annuity to provide more guaranteed income. Morningstar hypothesized that it would look like this: The annuity portion will apparently be run by TIAA-CREF. The idea is to provide a more stable income during those years when you really want a stable income: during your retirement. Perhaps it will help reduce the Sequence of Returns Risk a little better than the mix of stocks and bonds in the older version of target retirement funds. More information here: Best Investment Portfolios — 150+ Portfolios Better Than Yours The 15 Questions You Need to Answer to Build Your Investment Portfolio Probably not. Few have. They're brand new. That's reason enough for me not to buy them. Besides, for most WCIers, lifecycle funds are something they grow out of by necessity as their retirement account situation becomes more complex. It's fine for your Roth IRA in residency. Not so fine when you have a 403(b), a solo 401(k), Roth IRAs, a 457(b), a cash balance plan, and a big taxable account. Target retirement funds are all-in-one solutions that function great when all of your investments are in retirement accounts that offer them. That's not the case for most WCIers by the time they're 55, when this new series of target retirement funds would even start incorporating the annuities. I don't necessarily think these annuity-containing lifecycle funds are a terrible idea, but they also feel like a solution looking for a problem. I suspect most WCIers who want to annuitize a portion of their retirement assets are going to do it directly rather than via a target retirement fund—especially since you can't even buy these things in an IRA. It's good to know these Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds exist, but I think you can pass on them for now. What do you think? Are you interested in lifecycle funds that contain annuities? Why or why not? James M. Dahle, MD, FACEP, FAAEM is a practicing emergency physician and the founder of The White Coat Investor.

Δ Δ The problem these solve is that retirees move their money out of the employer plans. I can tell you that my father’s retirement has been financed mainly by TIAA and it has been extremely lucrative. The TIAA-CREF representative told him that his retirement was funded with 30 year treasuries that were purchased in the 70’s and 80’s when you could get 10% (for 30 years). 30 year rates are back to generational highs right now – but only at about 5%. I think Vanguard is trying to capture that lightning again with a vehicle that can pay out better than 5% yearly for the duration of retirement. This is to entice retiring employees to continue to use the employer funds – which was TIAA-CREF’s secret power. I actually think the tranche of retirees and near retirees who move into this (right now) could actually do pretty well.

Title: Colin Hunt: ‘We’ve seen greenwashing. The new phenomenon is greenhushing’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/09/colin-hunt-weve-seen-greenwashing-the-new-phenomenon-is-greenhushing/

For Colin Hunt, the Lego-loving chief executive of AIB, the State’s exit as investor in 2025 marked a satisfying milestone, with a big final piece of the bank’s painstaking rebuild clicking into place. “It was an important moment from a morale perspective, but it hasn’t led to any change in strategy or operations, because, in fairness, the State always acted as a rational investor and had a clear desire to exit the share register at a point in time,” said Hunt in an interview with The Irish Times. But some things have changed permanently since taxpayers were forced to commit €20.8 billion to prevent the bank’s collapse during the global financial crisis (GFC), he said. “AIB’s a very different organisation now. I think we’re far more externally oriented than we would have been pre-crisis. And I think AIB’s a less siloed, less hierarchical organisation than it was,” he said. “Banking globally is a very, very procyclical industry and, traditionally, banks would have overlent at the top of [economic] cycles and underlent at the bottom. Our approach now is very much that we take a medium term, acyclical approach and lend through the cycle.” The regulatory environment has changed utterly, too, with banks on both sides of the Atlantic required to hold higher levels of capital reserves and have ‘living wills’ in place to bail-in creditors if regulators deem a lender is likely to fail. The Central Bank of Ireland has gone further, introducing some of the strictest mortgage lending restrictions in Europe, higher fines for wrongdoing, and a regime to make it easier to find senior executives responsible for failings under their watch. “We’re very aware that without the support of Irish taxpayers, this bank would have ceased to exist,” said Hunt. “However, that would have been extraordinarily detrimental to the Irish economy and to our society.” At the end of October, AIB bought back stock warrants that the Government continued to hold in the bank after selling its remaining shares in the lender during the summer. It brought the total that the State has recovered from the bank’s rescue to almost €20.2 billion – leaving a shortfall of a little over €600 million. [ From PTSB sale to Revolut’s mortgage entry: why 2026 is set to be busy year in bankingOpens in new window ] Yet it was far from certain that taxpayers would recoup so much from Ireland’s costliest bailout of a surviving lender – particularly when AIB shares were trading below €1 each during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, just a seventh of the price at which the final shares were sold last June. However, the crisis led to two key developments that have fuelled the bank’s turnaround: a surge in inflation – further stoked by the Ukraine war – that triggered aggressive central bank rate hikes; and the purchase of two large loan books from Ulster Bank, as it exited the market. Ulster’s owner, NatWest, had highlighted the impact of Covid-19 when it confirmed in late 2020 that it was carrying out a strategic review of the bank. AIB – among the most rates-sensitive banks across the sector in Europe – couldn’t help but make record profits in recent years. Indeed, when the European Central Bank’s (ECB) deposit rate peaked at 4 per cent early 2024, AIB was making more money out of parking €32 billion of surplus deposits with the Central Bank than it was from its €35.7 billion Irish mortgage book. But Hunt, who took charge of the bank in 2019, said that measures undertaken by the bank have also underpinned earnings, including the use of financial derivatives – known as interest rate swaps – to protect the bank as the benchmark ECB rate fell by half in 13 months to last June. “That’s an insurance policy that’s working very well,” he said. AIB forecast in November that net interest income would decline only about 10 per cent last year from a record €4.13 billion in 2024. There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis AIB has seen its underlying loan book grow over the past four years, even after stripping out acquired Ulster loans. It follows a series of false dawns for when Irish bank balance sheets would grow again, after contracting dramatically after the financial crash. Hunt has also set up AIB for “a big opportunity” with decisions to repurchase Goodbody Stockbrokers, where he previously served as chief economist, in 2021 and get the bank back into life and pensions after a decade out of this business, by setting up a joint venture, AIB Life, with Canada’s Great-West Lifeco in 2023. Ageing populations are one of three “huge megatrends” (along with artificial intelligence, or AI, and electrification) that Hunt reckons will change the banking sector over the long term. The Republic’s old-age dependency ratio – the percentage of the population aged over 65 relative to those between 15 and 64 – will more than double to about 50 per cent in 2057. “There is inevitably going to be an increase in demand for savings, investment and pensions and it is incumbent on us to make sure that we have AIB-branded products available to our customers,” said Hunt. “And we now have that.” Still, it has a distance to go to catch up with its biggest rival on that front. [ ‘Down to the wire’: ECB’s digital euro project faces decisive vote in 2026Opens in new window ] Bank of Ireland managed to convince the European Commission in 2013 not to force a sale of its New Ireland arm under a restructuring plan tied to its taxpayer bailout. It also repurchased its former Davy unit in 2022, after the firm was plunged into crisis in the wake of a regulatory fine. RBC Capital Markets analysts estimated in a report last month that AIB had €17 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of 2025, with Goodbody accounting for 85 per cent and AIB Life the remainder. Bank of Ireland’s AUM stands at €58 billion, with a little over half of this in Davy. While Irish households have grown their wealth by an average of 7 per cent a year over the past decade – more than twice the European rate – they still hold only 12 per cent of their net worth in financial products, including life and investment products and direct shareholdings in companies, the RBC report said. This compares to 19 per cent in France and 16 per cent in Italy and Germany. With 85 per cent of the €172 billion of Irish household deposits sitting in current and on-demand deposit accounts earning little or nothing, according to the latest Central Bank data, RBC said AIB, with the greatest share of Irish deposits, has the best opportunity to nudge customers towards savings and investment products. Goodbody is also known to be in advanced talks to buy BCP Asset Management, which has about €3 billion of AUM. The relationship between AIB and Goodbody is “fundamentally different” from the one that existed when he left the stockbroking firm in 2004, said Hunt. AIB went on to sell the company in 2011 under an EU restructuring plan tied to its bailout. “There were tensions in that relationship that are absent now,” he said. “There is real collaboration and engagement. The AIB that Goodbody came back to is a fundamentally different beast from the one it left.” [ Don’t be fooled — everything has changed for the global economyOpens in new window ] Goodbody now provides investment, pension, and financial planning services for AIB Private Banking clients, whereas under the previous ownership, they competed against each other. Convincing households to put idle money on deposit to potentially better use may be difficult. “There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis,” said Hunt, who was surprised by how reluctant households were to move money to higher-earning term deposits that banks started to offer when ECB rates spiked. The residual trauma has played out in other ways, with debt across households and small businesses at a fraction of where they stood before the crisis, relative to income. “Leverage was completely overinflated in 2007. But, for me, one of the great mysteries in the past 10 years is that while we have had a marked recovery in Irish economic activity, we haven’t seen an increase in credit demand,” he said. “And the best explanation from what I’ve seen is that it’s down to the psychological damage done by the GFC and the collapse of the Irish economy.” AIB disappointed the stock market in early August when it reported that its loan book grew by only 1 per cent in the first half of the year to €71.6 billion, and downgraded its full-year growth forecast to 3 per cent from 5 per cent. This was mainly down to weakness in its international climate capital business, the smallest, but fastest-growing division in recent years, which specialises in large renewable and infrastructure projects across Ireland, Britain, Europe and North America, and caution among small Irish businesses. There was a notable slowdown in green energy investments in the US when Donald Trump took office as president in early 2025. “I think that decisions might have been paused initially,” said Hunt. “There is significantly less talk about the green transition than there was a few years ago. But it’s still happening.” Global spending on green energy investment rose almost 5 per cent to $2.2 trillion last year, double what was allocated to fossil fuels, according to International Energy Agency estimates. “We’ve had greenwashing in the past. The new phenomenon at work now is greenhushing. Investments are being made, projects are being built, but people aren’t talking about it,” he said. “I’ve been of the view for a very long time that capital will need to be deployed [for the green transition] at a scale and pace that we have never seen in the history of global banking. So, it’s an absolutely enormous opportunity – and it requires a certain skill set to safely, prudently deploy capital in this space. We have built that skill set over time.” When Hunt set up a capital climate unit after joining AIB in 2016 from Macquarie to run what was then the group’s wholesale, institutional and corporate banking division, it had four people. It now has about 110. “They do amazing work. They have a really strong reputation.” The team tends to be the lead arranger on many of the multi-banked deals in which it is involved – giving it the opportunity to shape transactions and secure higher fees. The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible. It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine On the retail side of the house, close to 60 per cent of the mortgage business written last year was for green loans – where the property has a building energy rating (Ber) between A1 and B3. All told, AIB exited 2025 “with good momentum” on the lending side, Hunt said, adding that he is “comfortable with the medium-term expectation that our loan book will grow by 5 per cent” on a compound annual growth rate basis. Hunt has insisted AIB will bring its running costs, which breached €2 billion last year, back below that level in 2026 – despite its commitment to increase salaries and ongoing inflation – as it continues a policy of not replacing most of the staff who are retiring or quitting naturally. Some analysts say the target will be a tough ask. Total headcount fell by 3 per cent in the 12 months to September – to about 10,350. AIB has become the early front-runner among the domestic banks in warming to AI. It introduced a conversational assistant, called Abi, to customers in 2024 to help with everyday banking questions across its phone and online banking systems. It also rolled out Microsoft Copilot, an AI assistant that helps users write, summarise, analyse data and complete everyday tasks, across the organisation last year. “The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible,” he said. “It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine.” Asked if he sees the increased adoption of AI ultimately leading to AIB targeting a much lower workforce, Hunt said: “We’re looking at AI now in terms of cyber [security], fraud detection, our IT resilience, and coding. And I do think you will see it become ever more present in all aspects of the business in the next number of years. Do I have numbers in my head about how this is going to impact our cost base? No. Do I think we’re going to be very significantly reducing our headcount? No.” Hunt said he sees AIB reducing its total workforce by 2-3 per cent a year, through ongoing natural attrition, “in the years ahead”. [ OTC Markets targets Irish companies as listing alternative in New YorkOpens in new window ] The chief executive, meanwhile, has pressed ahead with a plan for staff to work from one of its offices for a minimum of three days a week from the start of the year, even after the Financial Services Union (FSU) said members in the bank had voted “overwhelmingly” to reject the blueprint. The bank is continuing talks this month with the union under the guidance of a mediator on concerns and issues around the new hybrid working model. This year will see Hunt and his team work on the bank’s next three-year strategic plan, which will be presented to the board in November, and will run from 2027. “I’m not letting too many cats out of the bag at this stage by saying I don’t think that our strategic priorities are going to change,” he said. Of big interest to investors will be guidance on how the bank plans to distribute excess capital over the period. RBC estimates AIB has the capacity to fork out €5.7 billion to shareholders over three years by way of dividends and share buy-backs. AIB is also planning the launch of a mobile app in the second half of the year. “I’m really pleased with the shape it’s taking,” said Hunt. “It’s going to be far more intuitive and far easier to use, and it’s going to be more encompassing of all aspects of a person’s financial life.” In the near term, investors will learn how AIB plans to remunerate Hunt, after the Government lifted a bailout-era €500,000 executive pay cap last summer after selling its remaining shares in the bank. “It’s not a matter that I have any influence over. That is decided upon by the remuneration committee of the board, and ultimately by the board itself,” he said, adding that any changes will be revealed at the time of the annual results release, in early March.

NEW THINKING In December 2024, Omnicom merged with IPG, eliminating approximately 4,000 jobs. Among those displaced were hundreds of brand strategists who had spent their entire careers honing the art of positioning, differentiation, and cultural resonance. They didn’t lose their jobs because they weren’t talented or dedicated. They lost them because the infrastructure they relied on—the promise-making apparatus of the advertising age—collapsed from obsolescence. This wasn’t a cyclical downturn. It was structural. And understanding why requires an understanding of how brands have fundamentally changed the way they create value for their owners and the customers they serve. This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter. Join the world’s smartest marketers and subscribe here for actionable insights delivered directly to your inbox. The Shift Everyone Saw Coming (But Was Still Surprised By) For more than a century, the brand-building playbook was remarkably consistent: Make a promise. Tell it beautifully. Repeat until it sticks. Sneaker companies promised athletic identity. Banks promised security and partnership. Consumer brands competed on who could craft the most compelling story about what their product meant, not what it could actually do for you beyond its basic function. This made sense given the constraints of the era. A sneaker company couldn’t actually make you a better athlete—but it could make you feel like one. A bank couldn’t simplify the genuine complexity of personal finance—but it could promise you’d feel confident and secure. So an entire industry architecture evolved around this model: Agencies optimized persuasion. Research measured perception. Media delivered reach. Success meant winning the battle for attention and preference through superior creative execution and bigger media budgets. Here’s what changed: That playbook just became obsolete. Not outdated—obsolete. Like a Rolodex or a fax machine or the idea that you can build a brand without actually being useful to people. And the implications are more profound than most CMOs have fully absorbed. Which is understandable—it’s hard to notice the ground shifting when you’re standing on it. Three Technology Shifts That Ended the Promise Era Three technological capabilities emerged that fundamentally eliminated the constraints that made promise-based branding necessary: First, brands can now deliver contextual utility at scale. Connectivity, sensors, and AI enable brands to understand individual contexts in real-time and orchestrate genuinely personalized responses. Nike doesn’t just promise athletic identity anymore—it delivers adaptive training programs, biomechanical feedback, and performance optimization through Training Club. Capital One doesn’t promise financial confidence—it delivers real-time spending insights, instant fraud alerts, and automated savings tools. The promise has become operationalizable in ways that were simply impossible a decade ago. Second, consumer expectations shifted irreversibly. People now expect brands to be useful, not just meaningful. A 2024 Edelman study found that 67% of consumers define brand trust primarily through “helping me solve problems” rather than “sharing my values”—a complete inversion from 2015 when values alignment dominated. Cultural resonance still matters, but it’s become table stakes rather than differentiation. Amazon’s cultural salience is near zero, yet it maintains dominant positions because it relentlessly delivers operational value: speed, convenience, reliability, and price. Third, promise-making now creates vulnerability in transparent markets. Social media, review platforms, and instant information access have made gaps between promise and delivery instantly visible and permanently documented. Brands that overpromise face immediate, public accountability. There’s a reason “We’ve heard your feedback” became the most panic-inducing phrase in corporate communications. The old model—craft aspirational messaging, deliver adequate product—now generates backlash rather than loyalty. Trust gets built through consistent delivery of value, not repetition of claims. Why The Old Model Creates New Strategic Risks The promise-focused approach isn’t just less effective—it actively creates three forms of new strategic risks: Capital misallocation. Marketing budgets optimized for awareness and persuasion are generating diminishing returns. A 2023 McKinsey analysis of 200 CPG brands found that incremental media spend beyond baseline thresholds produced 0.3x ROI, while investment in what they called “experiential utilities” – apps, services, and personalization engines – generated 3.2x returns. Every dollar spent on louder promises is effectively subsidizing competitors who are building better delivery systems. Talent misalignment. The most sophisticated strategic and technical talent now gravitates toward brands that are building operational capabilities – product teams, experience designers, and data scientists—not communications roles. Agencies report 40% declines in applications from top-tier creative talent since 2019, while product-led brands like Stripe and Notion face talent surpluses. The promise model simply can’t attract the capabilities required for modern competition. Commodification risk. When multiple brands make similar promises without differentiated delivery, entire categories collapse into price competition. Consider banking: Every major institution promises ‘financial partnership’ and ‘personalized service.’ Yet 89% of consumers report experiencing no meaningful difference whatsoever. If you’ve ever tried to distinguish between Chase’s promise and Bank of America’s promise and Wells Fargo’s promise, you know exactly what I mean. They all sound like they were written by the same AI prompt: ‘Sound trustworthy but not boring, aspirational but not arrogant, personal but not creepy. Point being, the promise layer has become completely indistinguishable, forcing bank brand competition toward rate arbitrage. Meanwhile, brands with superior delivery systems, such as Chime’s instant notifications and Revolut’s multi-currency infrastructure, capture disproportionate growth despite minimal brand investment. Playing Three Games Simultaneously Here’s what I’ve learned watching brands win and lose over the past several years: They’re no longer just trying to play one simple game where the rules are known to everyone. They’re playing three different games simultaneously. There’s the game everyone knows: Products. Better ingredients, faster processors, longer battery life, and superior formulations. This is the traditional realm of functional performance where CPG and consumer tech have always competed: simple product features, tangible benefits, and superiority claims. Then there’s the game brand strategists have obsessed over for the past 20 years: Ideas. Cultural conversations about what the “good life” looks and feels like. Not just brand positioning, but participation in broader societal dialogue about meaning, identity, and values. This is where brands try to build emotional affinity, ethical identity, and cultural capital. But there’s a third game that’s fast becoming the deciding factor: Services. And I need to be specific about what I mean here, because I’m not talking about customer service. I am not referring to call centers, return policies, or post-purchase support functions. Those remain operationally important, but they’re cost centers focused on maintaining satisfaction. What I am talking about is capability delivery: Technologies, platforms, and orchestrated experiences that give customers new abilities or dramatically expand what they can accomplish with products. Sephora’s Skincredible AI skin analysis isn’t customer service fixing a problem; it’s giving customers the tools they need to choose the best products for their skin type. Nike Training Club doesn’t address product quality issues that arise after purchase; it helps its customers become better athletes. Capital One’s real-time spending insights don’t supply FAQs. They help build financial acumen. These services don’t merely satisfy their customers’ aspirations. They provide them with new abilities. And capability delivery generates a behavioral dependency that messaging simply can’t replicate. Once you’ve integrated Spotify’s algorithms into your daily routines, you don’t switch to a competitor offering better brand promises. You’ve offloaded the cognitive work of music curation to a system that knows your preferences better than you can articulate them yourself. That’s a moat built through delivered utility, not communicated meaning. The critical insight: The competitive hierarchy among these three games has completely inverted. And understanding how requires seeing the mechanism at work. How Culture Drives the Need for Services The traditional model assumed a linear progression: Products → Ideas → Communications. Build a better mousetrap, craft compelling meaning around it, and then broadcast that meaning at scale. The modern reality operates completely differently: Culture → Products → Services → Cultural Permission. Please allow me to show you how this works: Step 1: Culture elevates aspirations. Societal movements are perpetually redefining what “good living” means. Over the past decade, we’ve seen dramatic aspiration inflation across multiple dimensions: Step 2: Elevated aspirations raise the performance bar across products. These cultural shifts don’t just change what people want. They change what they expect brands to do. When culture elevates healthspan as a new well-being aspiration, food brands face pressure for clean ingredients, supplement brands need clinical validation, and fitness brands must deliver personalized optimization. The product performance threshold rises across entire categories. But here’s the critical dynamic: Product improvements alone no longer create sustainable advantage. Technology diffusion and manufacturing democratization mean functional parity arrives faster than ever. Plant-based proteins, carbon-neutral production and AI-powered personalization—these innovations spread across competitors within 18-24 months. Product superiority becomes temporary, not structural. Step 3: Services become the actual differentiation layer. Elevated cultural aspirations create expectations not just for better products, but for personalized, connected, joyful experiences of those products. This is where services (and experiences) enter as the new competitive battleground. Consider the beauty sector: Cultural conversations about inclusive beauty standards raised product expectations such as broader shade ranges, clean formulations, and dermatologist-tested ingredients. Every major brand can now meet these thresholds. Product parity is nearly complete. But Sephora dominates because it competes in the service layer: AI skin analysis, virtual try-on technology, personalized routine recommendations, community tutorials, and beauty advisor access. These services deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” experiences that elevated beauty aspirations demand. And here’s what matters most: Service delivery earns permission to shape cultural conversation. Sephora can credibly participate in defining beauty standards because it operationally delivers inclusive, personalized beauty experiences. Competitors still making promises about inclusive beauty without service infrastructure sound hollow—the gap between claim and capability is instantly visible to consumers. Step 4: The compounding loop that changes everything. Brands that build service layers don’t just differentiate. They trigger a self-reinforcing cycle: Culture elevates aspirations → Raises product and experience expectations → Brands that deliver service layer differentiate → Service delivery generates cultural credibility → Cultural credibility earns permission to shape the next cultural iteration → Strengthened cultural position attracts more users → More users generate behavioral data → Data improves service delivery → Improved services strengthen cultural authority → Culture elevates aspirations further. Brands stuck in the Products + Ideas model can’t enter this loop. They’re making cultural promises without experiential proof. Meanwhile, brands building service infrastructure compound their advantage with each cycle; cultural position strengthens operational capability, which strengthens cultural position. Why Meaning Still Matters—But Can’t Stand Alone This framework resolves what seems like a paradox: Cultural salience remains absolutely essential, but it’s now downstream from service delivery, not upstream from product marketing. Ideas are still the prize. Brands that shape cultural conversations about aspiration achieve disproportionate mindshare, loyalty, and pricing power. Nike’s cultural influence on athletic identity, Patagonia’s environmental leadership, and Apple’s creative empowerment positioning. These idea-level assets generate billions in equity value. But services have become a powerful weapon for winning in the marketplace of ideas. You can’t credibly shape cultural aspiration through messaging when competitors are delivering capability. Let me be clear: This doesn’t mean promises have no role. Brand awareness and initial consideration still require cultural presence. Consumers need to know a brand exists before they can experience its service layer. But awareness without delivered utility now creates vulnerability, not competitive advantage. A compelling brand promise gets you into the consideration set. But a compelling service determines whether you’ll win the decision and build the kind of behavioral loyalty that compounds over time. Three mechanisms explain why this shift happened: 1. Service as Cultural Credential: The New Authenticity Standard The brand services layer doesn’t replace cultural meaning. It validates it. Brands attempting to lead cultural conversations through messaging alone face immediate authenticity scrutiny in transparent markets where gaps between claims and capabilities are instantly visible. Consumers and critics ask, “What operational evidence gives you permission to speak on this topic?” The service layer provides the answer through demonstrated commitment, not stated values. Consider Patagonia. They earn permission to shape environmental conversations because their service infrastructure proves they’ve operationalized sustainability, not just marketed it. Their Worn Wear platform offers repair services and a used gear marketplace. Their supply chain transparency tools make factory data and material sourcing publicly available. Their environmental activism funding, the 1% for the Planet commitment, gets operationalized through actual donations you can track. This provides concrete evidence that environmental stewardship is structural to their business model, not performative in their advertising. When Patagonia’s leadership advocates for public lands protection or criticizes fast fashion, the service layer grants credibility. They’re not making promises about values. They’re demonstrating values through operational commitment that costs them margin, constrains their growth, and creates a competitive disadvantage in pure product comparisons. That sacrifice is what earns cultural authority. Now contrast this with the authenticity gap that undermines promise-based cultural positioning: Dove spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars on “Real Beauty” campaigns celebrating body diversity and challenging unrealistic beauty standards. Yet they delivered retail experiences and product formulations identical to competitors who made no such cultural claims. When you asked “what operational evidence supports your beauty inclusion message?” the answer was effectively “our advertising says so.” “The service layer provided no proof. The result: cultural skepticism, campaign fatigue, and minimal impact on actual beauty culture conversations despite massive investment. Meanwhile, Fenty Beauty achieved instant cultural authority in beauty inclusion with a fraction of Dove’s marketing budget. Why? Rihanna established a service infrastructure that implemented inclusivity by offering 40 foundation shades at launch, compared to the industry standard of 6-12, utilizing undertone-matching technology that catered to the full spectrum, ensuring diverse model representation across all customer touchpoints, not just in advertising, and developing products that prioritized historically underserved skin tones. The service layer granted permission to lead beauty culture conversations that Dove, despite decades of promise-based positioning and vastly larger budgets, couldn’t credibly join. This pattern is pretty consistent: Cultural salience remains the prize, but service delivery is the credential that earns entry to the competition. You can’t claim environmental leadership without circular service models. You can’t champion inclusion without operationalized accessibility. You can’t promise empowerment without capability-conferring tools. The service layer is how brands prove their cultural positioning is authentic rather than opportunistic. And in transparent markets, that proof is a prerequisite for cultural authority. This is why the three-marketplace model places Ideas downstream from Services in the modern competitive hierarchy. Brands don’t build service capabilities to support their cultural positioning. They earn cultural positioning by building service capabilities. The causality reversed. 2. Experience as Proof: Making Abstract Aspirations Tangible Abstract aspirations become concrete through delivered experiences. “Healthspan” as a cultural aspiration remains vague until Peloton delivers personalized training that makes you measurably stronger, or until Levels provides continuous glucose monitoring that reveals how specific foods impact your energy throughout the day. The service translates aspiration into felt reality. And felt reality is infinitely more persuasive today than aspirational storytelling. 3. Behavioral Integration: Creating Mental Availability Through Utility When brands deliver utility in specific contexts, they achieve what The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute calls mental availability at Category Entry Points—the purchase moments that actually matter. Tesla famously doesn’t advertise, yet it dominates EV consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value, the Supercharger network, over-the-air updates, and autopilot capability are in the exact moments relevant to EV purchase decisions. The service delivery is the marketing, creating situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate. The Pattern of Competitive Displacement The three-marketplace framework reveals why incumbents with superior product heritage and decades of cultural equity are losing to service-first challengers. Again, allow me to show you the pattern I’ve seen everywhere in my work and research: Traditional Banking vs. Chime/Revolut Incumbents compete on Products (marginally better rates) plus Ideas (trust and partnership messaging). Challengers compete on services: instant notifications, fee elimination, multi-currency infrastructure, and automated savings. Despite zero brand equity, service-first challengers capture disproportionate growth because they deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” financial experience that elevated money-management aspirations demand. Traditional Retail vs. Amazon Department stores maintained superior product curation and cultural positioning; lifestyle aspiration and promises of personal service. Amazon built service infrastructure: 1-click ordering, Prime shipping, personalized recommendations, and Alexa integration. Amazon’s cultural salience is minimal, yet it dominates because service delivery creates behavioral lock-in that messaging can’t overcome. Traditional Beauty vs. Sephora Legacy brands owned a stronger product heritage. L’Oréal formulations and Estée Lauder brand prestige and cultural equity were built through decades of advertising investment. Sephora invested in the service layer: virtual try-on, skin analysis, its Beauty Insider community, and personalized routines. Now Sephora shapes beauty culture conversations despite having weaker product IP. Service delivery earned cultural permission that heritage brands assumed was permanent. Traditional Eyewear vs. Warby Parker This same pattern extends beyond tech giants to mid-market challengers in commodity categories. Everyone knows this story by now. Warby Parker entered a mature eyewear market dominated by Luxottica’s brands (Ray-Ban, Oakley, and LensCrafters), which had superior product heritage, widespread retail presence, and a design legacy spanning 50+ years. Warby couldn’t win on lens technology. Prescription optics are scientifically standardized. They couldn’t win on frame design alone because fashion cycles move too fast for sustainable differentiation there. They won by competing in the service layer: Home Try-On, which ships five frames free for customer testing; Virtual Try-On technology using AR-based fit visualization; prescription renewal reminders; streamlined insurance integration; and Vision for All, which is its social impact program delivering donated glasses. These services delivered the “personalized, convenient, socially conscious” eyewear experience that elevated consumer aspirations demanded. Aspirations that Luxottica’s promise-based marketing through celebrity endorsements and fashion advertising couldn’t satisfy operationally. The result: Warby Parker achieved $500M+ revenue and market-leading satisfaction scores despite competing against brands with 50+ years of cultural equity and 100x their marketing budget. Service delivery earned cultural permission. Warby Parker now shapes conversations about accessible, responsible, stylish eyewear that incumbent brands can’t easily defend against. Their product was comparable. Their experience layer created an asymmetric advantage. The pattern holds across categories, even B2B: Service infrastructure beats cultural promise when aspirations have elevated beyond what products alone can deliver. How Service Delivery Creates Compounding Advantage Brands that architect service delivery systems rather than communication strategies build three forms of advantage that compound over time: 1. How Services Create Dozens of Moments Where Your Brand Matters Here’s something that becomes clear when you study what’s actually working: When you deliver utility through services, you’re not just strengthening the moments where people already think about your brand. You’re multiplying the number of moments where your brand comes to mind in the first place. Traditional brands compete for mental real estate at a handful of purchase occasions. Nike shows up when someone thinks, “I need running shoes.” Gatorade comes to mind at “I’m thirsty after my workout.” These are discrete, infrequent moments, maybe once or twice a year, where brand awareness determines which product ends up in the shopping cart. But watch what happens when Nike builds Training Club. Suddenly, Nike becomes mentally available at entirely different moments: “I’m starting my morning workout.” “I need motivation to actually exercise today.” “I want to track whether I’m making progress.” “I’m planning my fitness routine for the week.” “I’m recovering from an injury and need modified exercises.” “I’m training for my first 10K.” Each of these situations creates a new trigger point where Nike comes to mind—not because someone saw an ad recently, but because Nike’s service delivers utility in that specific context. They’ve gone from owning 2-3 purchase moments to being present across 15-20 behavioral moments in someone’s life. Promise-based competitors are still fighting for the same old purchase occasions with louder messaging and bigger media budgets. Meanwhile, service-delivering brands have quietly embedded themselves into dozens of daily situations through integrated utility. The compounding advantage works like this: When someone finally forms purchase intent – when they actually need new running shoes – the brand that’s been useful across twenty different moments wins consideration automatically. Not because their last ad was more memorable, but because they’ve built mental availability through delivered value across multiple contexts in that person’s life. And here’s what makes this a real moat: These aren’t just awareness touchpoints and memory structures. They’re habit formation moments. Changing someone’s opinion about a brand is relatively straightforward. A competitor’s advertising campaign can shift preference in a few months. But changing someone’s embedded daily routines? That’s extraordinarily difficult. Once Tesla’s Supercharger network becomes part of how you plan road trips, once Peloton’s 6am class becomes non-negotiable in your morning routine, and once Spotify’s Discover Weekly feels like it knows you better than you know yourself, switching to a competitor means disrupting established behavioral patterns. That friction protects market position far more effectively than emotional brand attachment alone. As I’ve already said, Tesla doesn’t run ads, yet they dominate electric vehicle consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value at every moment that matters for EV ownership: route planning through Supercharger network locations, managing charging anxiety through fast infrastructure, receiving software updates over-the-air, optimizing performance through autopilot capability, and protecting resale value through battery warranty programs. The service delivery is the marketing. They’ve created situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate—and competitors can’t disrupt by outspending them on Super Bowl spots. The contrast is stark: Traditional brands spend millions fighting for 2-3 moments of consideration. Service-first brands invest their capital in building capabilities that create 15-20 moments of integration. One approach buys temporary awareness. The other builds behavioral dependency. That’s not a better marketing strategy. That’s a different category of competitive advantage entirely. 2. Learning That Compounds: Why Brand Services Improve 10-20x Faster Promise-based brands study consumers. Service-based brands learn from them. This distinction creates a structural advantage in speed-to-market fit that compounds over time. Traditional brands optimize through episodic research cycles: Conduct focus groups to understand preferences. Analyze survey data to identify unmet needs. Test campaign concepts to predict resonance. Measure post-launch performance to assess effectiveness. Adjust messaging for the next iteration. This cycle takes 6-12 months minimum, often longer for complex categories. By the time a brand has learned whether a message resonates and has deployed adjusted creative, market conditions have shifted, cultural moments have passed, and competitors have moved. Branded services and experiences are optimized through continuous behavioral feedback: Every interaction that delivers value generates data about actual usage patterns, contextual preferences, and revealed priorities, not stated intentions. Algorithms process this data in real time, not quarterly. Improvements deploy daily or hourly, not annually. Spotify doesn’t survey users about music preferences every six months. It processes 500+ million listening sessions per day and continuously adjusts recommendations. Netflix doesn’t run focus groups about content preferences. It analyzes billions of viewing decisions and uses those signals to inform content production and personalization engines. This compression of learning cycles means service-delivering brands achieve product-market fit 10-20x faster than research-dependent competitors. A service feature that isn’t creating engagement can be identified within days and modified within weeks. A messaging campaign that isn’t driving awareness requires months to measure and quarters to adjust. The velocity difference is structural, not tactical. More importantly, the learning compounds exponentially through a self-reinforcing cycle: Better service attracts more users → More users generate more behavioral data → More data enables algorithmic improvement → Improved algorithms deliver better service → Better service attracts more users. Each cycle strengthens the next, creating what people in tech call data network effects. Promise-based brands can’t enter this compounding loop because they’re optimizing communications about value, not capabilities that deliver it. You can’t A/B test your way to delivered utility. You can’t survey your way to behavioral integration. You can’t focus-group your way to capability conferral. Optimization happens through usage, which requires operational infrastructure that messaging-focused organizations don’t build and that agency partners can’t provide. Sephora’s beauty advisor recommendations improve with every skin analysis completed, every product review submitted, and every purchase made. The system learns which advice generates satisfaction and which creates returns. This learning is specific, behavioral, and continuous, creating service quality that manual consultation or static product knowledge can’t match. Competitors can copy Sephora’s service concept. But they can’t copy the years of behavioral learning embedded in the algorithms. The data moat is as defensible as the experiential moat. 3. Cultural Authority Through Demonstrated Values Brands that operationalize cultural aspirations through service delivery achieve authentic cultural presence without performative messaging. IKEA is an excellent case in point. The company’s commitment to sustainability is important to the culture because it’s built into the way they do business. For example, their Furniture Buyback program pays customers for used items, their refurbishment workshops fix and resell returned items, and their spare parts marketplace extends the life of products. These aren’t marketing claims—they’re measurable service systems customers can use. When brands demonstrate values through capability delivery, they earn cultural authority. When they merely state values through communications, they invite skepticism. The Strategic Imperative—And the Infrastructure Problem The shift from promise to delivery represents a categorical transformation in how brands create competitive advantage through customer value creation. The three-marketplace model reveals the mechanism: Culture elevates aspirations → Products must meet raised bars but quickly commoditize → Services differentiate by delivering elevated experiences → Service delivery earns cultural permission → Cultural authority compounds operational advantage. Technology eliminated the excuse for gaps between aspiration and reality. Consumers recalibrated expectations accordingly. But here’s the strategic tension most brand leaders haven’t fully confronted yet: When brands shift from making cheap promises to expensive experience innovation, the cost of guessing wrong increases dramatically. A failed advertising campaign costs media dollars and creative agency fees—painful, but contained. The brand survives. You regroup, test new messaging, and try again next quarter. Campaign failure is recoverable. A failed service platform costs engineering years, operational integration complexity, and customer trust. When you’ve asked customers to change behavior, integrate your service into their routines, share personal data, and invest time learning your interface, and then you deprecate that service, deliver broken experiences, or pivot strategy, leaving them stranded, you don’t just lose the financial investment. You lose permission. And unlike a cheesy Super Bowl ad that everyone forgets by February, a broken service or a poor experience is the kind of betrayal that still gets mentioned in a Reddit thread five years later. ‘Remember when Brand X launched that thing and it just… stopped working? Yep, never trusting them again. Brands that waste people’s time or betray their trust through incompetent execution don’t often get a second chance from their customers. Service failures create lasting brand damage that messaging can’t easily repair. This asymmetry creates a new imperative: Brand strategy can no longer afford to run on creative intuition, historical precedent, and post-launch measurement. The decision-making infrastructure that served the promise era is fundamentally inadequate for the capability era. A Clear Gap in Our Brand-Building Infrastructure The tools that most CMOs currently rely on, such as focus groups, brand tracking studies, campaign pre-testing, message recall metrics, and annual strategy planning cycles, were engineered for a world where: This infrastructure can’t support the new capability era, where The New Capabilities We Need For Experience Innovation CMOs investing in experience innovation need analytical infrastructure that can: → Simulate how cultural communities will respond before launching service platforms: Will this capability feel valuable or intrusive to target segments? Does it align with their elevated aspirations or violate their expectations for brand behavior? Which cultural communities will embrace it versus reject it? → Model which service touchpoints create sustainable habits versus one-time engagement: How many different life contexts must the service serve to achieve meaningful mental availability? What’s the threshold for behavioral lock-in that creates real switching costs? → Predict how quickly usage data will improve service quality: What volume of users is required to generate meaningful learning? At what point do the data advantages create defensible competitive moats versus remaining replicable by well-funded competitors? → Test whether proposed experiences actually deliver the elevated, personalized, joyful experiences that current cultural aspirations demand: Or will they feel transactional, generic, and friction-filled, failing to meet the raised performance bar that culture has established? → Assess operational feasibility and integration complexity: What organizational capabilities, technology infrastructure, and partnership ecosystems are required to deliver this service reliably at scale? Where are the execution risks that could turn a theoretically strong service into a practically broken experience? Current brand management tools still operate on unreasonably long timescales and fuzzy data types, such as stated preferences from surveys, recall metrics from tracking studies, and claimed behaviors from focus groups. All of these are fundamentally mismatched to service platform decisions. When you’re committing engineering years and operational integration to a capability that customers will depend on daily, you can’t afford to “test and learn” after launch. The cost of learning through failure is too high. Customer patience for broken experiences is too low. The competitive window for establishing behavioral advantages closes too quickly. The gap between what brand strategy now requires and what current analytical infrastructure provides has never been wider. Closing that gap – building decision-making tools adequate to the risks, speed, and complexity of experience innovation – is perhaps the most urgent infrastructure challenge facing marketing organizations today. The strategists who master this new discipline won’t just help brands avoid expensive mistakes. They’ll help brands simulate, test, and optimize service strategies in low-risk environments before committing capital to high-risk deployment. They’ll compress the learning cycle from years to weeks. They’ll turn experience innovation from a leap of faith into a calculated investment with predictable returns. That capability doesn’t exist at scale yet. Which means the professionals who build it will define the next era of brand strategy practice. The Human Cost—And the Professional Opportunity Remember the hundreds of strategists who lost their jobs in December? This is what this shift means for them—and frankly anyone navigating the future of brand building today. This isn’t just theoretical. It’s deeply personal for thousands of talented people right now. The market for traditional brand strategy work is contracting. Not cyclically, but structurally. When brands realize that incremental media spend produces 0.3x ROI while experience infrastructure generates 3.2x returns, they don’t just shift budgets—they shift what kind of expertise they actually need. The demand signal moves from “help us craft better messages” to “help us architect better value delivery.” This creates profound professional displacement. Strategists trained in cultural semiotics, brand positioning frameworks, and campaign development find their core skills misaligned with what clients now require. The anxiety in the strategy community is real and entirely justified. Careers that seemed secure—trajectories pointing toward Chief Strategy Officer roles, agency leadership, and independent consulting—suddenly feel precarious. But I want to be clear about something: This displacement isn’t the death of brand strategy. It’s the genesis of something more valuable. The shift from promise to delivery doesn’t eliminate the need for strategic thinking; it elevates it. The questions become harder, the stakes become higher, and the impact becomes more measurable: Old question: How do we position our brand to resonate culturally? New question: What service capabilities must we build to earn permission to shape cultural conversations? Old question: What message will differentiate us from competitors? New question: What delivered experiences will create behavioral advantages that messaging can’t overcome? Old question: How do we communicate our values authentically? New question: What operational systems will demonstrate our values through capability delivery? These new questions aren’t easy to answer. They require strategic rigor plus an understanding of technology enablement, operational feasibility, data architecture, and service design. They demand strategists who can operate at the intersection of culture, capability, and customer value—not just at the intersection of culture, creativity, and communications. I firmly believe this is the future of brand strategy work: helping companies build value-delivery systems that earn cultural authority rather than crafting communications that try to cheat it. The opportunity space is vast: These aren’t incremental evolutions of existing roles. They’re new disciplines that don’t yet have established career paths, educational pipelines, or professional associations. Which means: The strategists who master this transition will define the next era of our profession. For many strategy professionals, the recent layoffs feel like a hopeless ending. And for too many careers, they will be. But for strategists willing to evolve from promise architects to value delivery shapers, this moment represents the most significant professional opportunity of our era. The old guard is collapsing. The new infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. And yet, the brands that will dominate the next decade desperately need strategic guidance on how to make this transition without destroying operational efficiency or customer trust in the process. The uncertainty you’re feeling isn’t the absence of a future. It’s the absence of a defined future. Someone will define it. The question is whether displaced strategists will lead that redefinition effort or wait for engineers to do it for them. And trust me—you don’t want engineers defining what ‘cultural salience’ means.

Title: Ethereum: BlackRock buys $149mln of ETH, but sellers guard THIS zone

Whales locked supply, leverage unwound, yet ETH refused to move decisively. What’s holding price in place? On-chain data showed whales rotating $31.7 million into staked Ethereum, locking over 40,000 stETH as BlackRock accumulated ETH during market volatility. Large holders continued rotating capital into ETH staking. One whale redeployed $31.7 million via Wintermute, then converted the funds into over 40,000 stETH, worth roughly $126 million. That move locked the supply instead of keeping it liquid. Alongside this, BlackRock added 46,851 ETH, valued near $149 million, over three consecutive days, reinforcing sustained accumulation. Meanwhile, BitMine expanded its commitment by staking an additional 19,200 ETH. This pushed its total staked balance to 827,008 ETH, worth about $2.62 billion. These figures mattered because staking and accumulation removed ETH from circulation. As a result, immediate sell-side pressure continued to thin. Even so, the price did not react impulsively. Ethereum [ETH] traded inside a clearly defined range, reflecting balance rather than weakness. Sellers continued defending the $3,300–3,350 supply zone, where several recovery attempts stalled. Buyers, however, consistently stepped in near the $2,780–2,850 demand zone. Recent pullbacks slowed around $2,800, then rebounded toward $3,100 without acceleration. This repeated behavior highlighted absorption. Volatility narrowed as the price oscillated between these levels. As a result, downside momentum weakened with each test of demand. Sellers struggled to force continuation. Buyers also avoided chasing breakouts. Instead, they accumulated gradually. This range-bound structure aligned with growing staking activity. Locked supply reduced panic selling. Consequently, price stability improved as the market waited for direction. Source: TradingView Spot flow data reinforced the same narrative. ETH continued posting persistent net outflows from exchanges. Recent daily figures showed withdrawals exceeding $52.3M, extending a multi-week trend. This matters because exchanges represent immediate selling venues. When ETH exits, sellers lose fast access to liquidity. Therefore, the circulating supply keeps tightening. However, price has not surged sharply. That detail signals accumulation rather than speculative chasing. Buyers absorb supply without forcing higher levels. Meanwhile, sellers fail to generate follow-through on dips. Outflows remain steady rather than reactive. This consistency reduces downside risk. Each retracement meets thinner sell pressure. Consequently, ETH stabilizes faster after pullbacks, reinforcing the broader compression structure. Source: CoinGlass Derivatives data added another layer to the picture. Open Interest declined by about 2.03%, settling near $40.64 billion. That drop reflected leverage unwinding rather than aggressive short positioning. Importantly, the ETH price held firm during the reduction. This limited forced liquidations and cooled volatility. As leverage exited, the market reset risk instead of amplifying moves. Lower Open Interest reduced liquidation cascades during pullbacks. Consequently, downside moves lost speed and depth. Combined with staking growth and exchange outflows, reduced leverage supported price stability. The market shifted from speculation toward positioning. Source: CoinGlass Overall, growing staking and accumulation activity pointed to rising conviction that downside risk remained limited at current levels. Locked supply, persistent exchange outflows, and declining leverage continued to reduce selling pressure. Upside remained gradual, but structure favored stability over breakdowns.

Title: Warner Bros investors torn on Paramount Skydance bid

Some investors criticise board’s rejection of Paramount’s offer, citing better regulatory chances Share Save Some of Warner Bros Discovery’s biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance’s sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until January 21 to accept Paramount’s latest $108.4bn proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of, Stranger Things, is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7bn, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount’s deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 percent of Warner Bros, as of September 30, agrees with the board. “The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent,” Fitch said in an email to Reuters. Though Paramount’s offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it does not cover the $2.8bn breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5bn in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350m in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board’s decision to reject Paramount’s offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The deal would leave the combined company with $87bn in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent on Wednesday that the board “breached its fiduciary duty” to shareholders by rejecting Paramount’s offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny. Warner Bros’s board “is choosing not to inquire about what improvements Paramount is willing to make to its offer,” he said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path to regulatory approval. “At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.” Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros’ fifth-largest shareholder, remains open to changing its position. “If they [Paramount] come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage,” Fitch said. It is not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes Harry Potter and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired the US and Australian distribution rights to the runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance, Heated Rivalry. Warner Bros’s top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some 22 percent. All three are also among the top 10 investors in Paramount and Netflix. On Wall Street, Warner Bros stock is down 0.7 percent while Paramount stock is up 0.7 percent in midday trading. Netflix is trending downwards at 0.2 percent below the market open. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: CA hires DEI chief to 'integrate DEI' into retirement investments – has no finance experience

CalPERS, which faces an estimated $166 billion shortfall, insists the position won't influence financial choices.

Title: Amazon demands proof of productivity from employees, asking for list of accomplishments
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/08/amazon-demands-proof-of-productivity-from-employees-asking-for-list-of-accomplishments/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T18:33:03Z
Full Content:
Internal documents reveal that Amazon is asking its corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider. Employees must provide specific examples of what they delivered to the company, along with actions they plan to take in order to continue growing at the company. “Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,” the internal guideline specified. “Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn’t lead to the results you hoped for.” The performance review process, known internally as Forte, helps the company determine future pay. The new performance standards mark a break from previous reviews, according to people familiar with the matter, placing greater emphasis on individual accomplishments than in recent years. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million globally, with most of its corporate employees subject to the performance review process. Past Amazon reviews have placed less emphasis on productivity, instead asking employees about their areas of interest and strengths, posing questions like “When you’re at your best, how do you contribute?” To be sure, productivity is a common metric measured in corporate performance reviews. Productivity, along with goal progress, strengths and attendance are common talking points of corporate performance reviews. And an updated performance review does not indicate that Amazon plans to conduct layoffs. Yet Amazon’s performance review models standards around employee discipline that have become commonplace throughout the tech industry in recent years. After taking over X (formerly Twitter) in 2022, Elon Musk demanded Twitter employees explain what they accomplished each week, a tactic he brought to the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency last year. CBS News chief Bari Weiss asked her staff to describe their jobs to her when she took over in October 2025, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The review shift matches similar changes made at Amazon since Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos as CEO. In September 2024, the company initiated a return-to-office requirement for corporate employees and, in May 2025, altered compensation to better reward the highest performers. Documents leaked in 2022 revealed a peek into the company’s review process. In the documents, Amazon bosses were instructed to gauge an employee’s “overall value” by evaluating two metrics: their performance score and the potential they had exhibited. The tech giant has also reshaped its workforce through layoffs. In October, the company laid off 14,000 corporate employees amid broader AI investments. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is bullish on emerging AI technologies and has sought aggressive cost-cutting measures for the company since starting in the role. Last June, Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that “AI agents will change how we all work and live,” defining agents as “teammates” that will help employees “focus less on rote work.” And in July, Jassy told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that AI would fundamentally reshape Amazon’s workforce, automating menial work while creating new opportunities in advanced technology. However, Jassy says that the corporate layoffs had nothing to do with AI development or cutting costs, pointing instead to a mismatched cultural fit. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said. “It’s culture.” Amazon is placing its bets on AI, announcing in July an additional $100 million investment in AWS generative AI, as well as $50 billion in investments to expand AI and supercomputing infrastructure for government agencies.

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. January 8, 2026 A new year means a fresh CES, and once again Las Vegas turned into tech central for CES 2026. Our team spent the week on the ground, walking the show floors, chasing down announcements, and getting hands-on with as many products as humanly possible. Nobody can see everything at CES, since the show is massive, but we focused on the gear that genuinely stood out. This year brought big upgrades in smart home tech, plenty of creative ideas in mobile and wearables, smarter displays, and a few products that simply put a smile on our faces. So let’s get into it. Here are the Android Authority Best of CES 2026 Award winners. Samsung’s boldest foldable yet made its public debut at CES 2026. The Galaxy Z TriFold immediately feels like both a glimpse of what’s next and a reminder of how hard that future is to reach. This is Samsung’s first phone that folds twice, opening from a standard cover display into a full 10-inch AMOLED tablet. The TriFold finally delivers on the long-promised idea of a tablet that actually fits in your pocket. Internally, the Galaxy Z TriFold shares a lot with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and the same camera setup, but adds a larger 5,400mAh battery to help power the much bigger screen. Where the TriFold really separates itself is software. One UI 8 on Android 16 enables true three-app multitasking, splitting the screen into equal thirds without crushing app layouts. Samsung DeX can also run directly on the device, turning the inner display into a full desktop workspace without an external monitor. The Galaxy Z TriFold is an engineering statement more than a mass-market product, but as a Best of CES pick, it shows just how far Samsung is willing to push form factors. SPONSORED ARZOPA is known for its innovative, affordable digital display technology, designed to elevate how we work, play, and connect. And while Christmas might be behind us, you don’t need special occasions to give your family gifts, especially when it’s something as thoughtful and bound to bring a whole lot of joy as the ARZOPA D14 Digital Photo Frame. While you might be away from your family, the D14 digital photo frame lets you still share beautiful moments and memories instantly. With just a tap, you can send photos and videos to any D14 photo frame anywhere in the world, so every update becomes a shared moment, with share-anytime-anywhere convenience. Of course, multiple family members can send photos and videos directly to the frame, keeping you instantly connected to your family, even if you’re thousands of miles apart. With a gorgeous 14-inch IPS anti-glare display with a Full HD resolution, every photo and video stands out in beautiful detail. It connects to Wi-Fi, so pictures and videos are uploaded and available instantly, and you can even send 2-minute video messages through the frame. With 32GB of built-in storage, microSD card support, and free and unlimited cloud storage, you can share plenty of memories for years; no subscriptions or fees to worry about. It’s easy to set up and use, and is designed to blend seamlessly into any space around your or your family’s home. Whether it’s for your parents, grandparents, siblings, or your own household, the ARZOPA D14 Digital Photo Frame is a gift that grows more and more meaningful the more you share. TCL doubled down on eye comfort at CES 2026 with the NXTPAPER 70 Pro, a phone built for people who spend a lot of time staring at their screens. Using NXTPAPER 4.0, the 6.9-inch FHD+ 120Hz display has a matte, paper-like finish that cuts glare and reflections without sacrificing smoothness. It feels closer to reading on paper than a normal display and that difference is obvious the moment you pick it up. The dedicated NXTPAPER button returns, letting you switch between display modes, including a high-contrast monochrome option that is ideal for reading. TCL also improved the anti-flicker tech, which not only reduces eye strain but makes the screen easier to film without visible banding, a small touch that shows how much thought went into real-world use. Under the hood, the NXTPAPER 70 Pro keeps things sensible. You get a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization and TCL’s MuseFilm processing, a Dimensity 7300 chip, and a 5,200mAh battery. Performance is not chasing flagships, but that is not the point here. Optional T-Pen support and built-in AI translation features add to the phone’s practical appeal. Priced from around $400, the TCL NXTPAPER 70 Pro stands out by offering a genuinely different smartphone experience. SPONSORED DREO is known for its intuitive, efficient, powerful, and elegantly designed home appliances. From tower fans and ceiling fans to portable ACs, humidifiers, heaters, and more, DREO offers a massive portfolio of performance-focused, user-centric products that make your home life easier. And the brand is bringing all that expertise to its latest product showcase at CES 2026 – the TurboCool™ Misting Fan 765S. As its name suggests, the Misting Fan 765S delivers faster, stronger cooling you can feel immediately. It’s dramatically cooler from the get-go, beyond anything you’d get from traditional fans and evaporative coolers, with lab tests showing a massive ambient temperature drop of up to 10°F. When used as a misting fan or humidifier, it’s designed for mess-free indoor use. The device produces ultrafine 17 μm mist that evaporates rapidly without condensing, even at the highest mist output levels. A dedicated internal blower system and an advanced dual-channel flow system separate air and mist paths, preventing the formation of large droplets. You won’t have to worry about damp floors or furniture when using the fan in Mist or Humidifier modes. Its HyperSilent™ operation, going as low as 20 db, makes it ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, and close-range use. Whether you’re working, watching TV, or sleeping, the Misting Fan 765S won’t be a distraction. And finally, the Misting Fan 765S is easy to manage and maintain. Its pump-free architecture eliminates mold and bacteria buildup, and it’s easy to remove, clean, and refill the 6L tank. The large tank provides up to 7 hours of Turbo cooling, or up to 30 hours in lower settings. You get independent wind and mist adjustments, 12 fan speeds, and integrated temperature and humidity sensors so you can find the perfect balance. Everything is easy to set up and control, via the app, using your voice (compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant), or with a remote. The DREO TurboCool™ Misting Fan 765S is priced at $179.99 and will be available from April 2026. SPONSORED We see lots of smart lighting showcased at events like CES, and this year is no different. One that truly stands out from the crowd is the Linkind SP6 Smart Solar Pathway Light. Designed for backyards and lawns with pathways, the SP6 is ideal for anyone looking to upgrade their pathway lighting, bringing not only safety but also a touch of style and elegance to your home’s outdoor areas. What makes the SP6 pathway light special is the inclusion of five interchangeable projection lenses that let you create patterns like Ripple, Concentric, Radial, Circular, and Lozenge. The best part? It’s all managed and controlled through the AiDot app; no tools required, and you don’t have to swap lenses manually to change the projection pattern. With 60 lumens of output and tunable white and full-spectrum RGB color adjustment, the possibilities for your outdoor decor are endless. The SP6 Smart Pathway Lights are easy to install and durable, and are powered by an advanced MPPT system that optimizes solar charging, especially in low-light conditions. A full charge gives you 12 hours of brightness, and there’s also an Eco Mode for extended running. And if solar power isn’t enough, say, during poor weather, you can also charge the lights via the built-in USB-C port. With multiple lights, you can turn your walkway into a personal lighting experience. With Bluetooth Mesh, you get automatic syncing across connected devices without a hub or Wi-Fi. And through the app, you also get 43 preset modes, music-sync capability, and scheduling for seamless, coordinated lighting effects. If you’re looking to enhance your outdoor pathway lighting, the Linkind SP6 Smart Solar Pathway Lights offer the convenience and ease of use like no other and are a great way to improve your outdoor safety and ambiance. Roborock went big at CES 2026 with the Saros Rover, a robot vacuum that rethinks mobility in a way we have not seen before. Instead of trying to work around obstacles, the Rover deals with them head-on. It uses a pair of hinged wheel-legs that let it balance, lift itself, and move over uneven surfaces, including stairs. Yes, it can climb stairs, and it can clean them while doing so. Unlike earlier stair solutions that simply carry a vacuum from one floor to another, the Saros Rover stays active the entire time. As it climbs, one leg remains planted on the step below to keep the body stable, while the other moves forward. That lets the Rover clean each step individually on the way up or down. Roborock says the system also works on curved staircases and ramps, which makes it far more flexible than past attempts at vertical cleaning. The Rover is still a preview rather than a finished product, and Roborock is not ready to talk pricing or launch timing yet. Even so, seeing it operate in person makes one thing clear. This is a strong attempt to solve one of the last major problems in robotic cleaning, and it hints at a future where no part of your home is off-limits to a robot vacuum. Motorola made its biggest foldable leap yet at CES 2026 with the Razr Fold, the company’s first book-style foldable and a clear signal that the Razr brand is no longer limited to clamshells. Built around an 8.1-inch inner display and a tall outer screen, the Razr Fold feels immediately familiar if you have used other large foldables. But it still carries Motorola’s design DNA, from its clean software look to its signature materials and finishes. In hand, the Razr Fold strikes a balance between size and comfort. It opens into a spacious tablet-like canvas that feels well-suited for any task. Meanwhile, the outer display remains useful enough to handle quick tasks without unfolding. Motorola’s hardware confidence shows here. The hinge feels solid, the displays are bright and smooth, and the overall design feels well thought out. Motorola’s software approach also plays to its strengths. The experience stays close to stock Android, with light customization and thoughtful touches carried over from the Razr flip lineup. Even in early hands-on time, the interface feels calm and approachable on a large screen, which is not always a given with foldables. The Razr Fold marks Motorola’s entry into large foldables with a clear focus on design, usability, and brand identity. If Motorola can follow through on polish and long-term support, the Razr Fold has the potential to become a compelling alternative for people who want an approachable large foldable. XGIMI surprised us at CES 2026 by stepping away from projectors and into wearable tech with the Memo One, the lead product under its new MemoMind brand. These AI glasses actually look and feel wearable, weighing just 28.9g and designed for all-day use without calling attention to themselves. In person, the Memo One feels closer to normal eyewear than most smart glasses we have seen so far. The Memo One uses dual-eye displays paired with built-in speakers to deliver information discreetly. The system focuses on short, relevant interactions, such as live translation, summaries, reminders, note-taking, and contextual guidance. Powering all of this is a hybrid AI system that dynamically selects the best model for each task, pulling from multiple major AI platforms in the background. Comfort and personalization are clearly a priority. XGIMI offers multiple frame styles and interchangeable temples, along with full prescription lens support. Battery life is also handled sensibly, with all-day use from the glasses themselves and a charging case that can stretch total runtime close to a full week. At around $599, the MemoMind Memo One are not cheap, but they feel thoughtfully positioned. If AI glasses are going to move beyond novelty, this is the kind of approach that gives them a real shot. Lenovo brought a more focused handheld experience to CES 2026 with the SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2. It is the same second-generation hardware as the Windows model, but paired with Valve’s controller-first operating system for players who want their handheld to feel closer to a console than a tiny PC. The pitch is simple and effective. SteamOS handles quick suspend and resume, native Steam library access, cloud saves, and a UI built around buttons and sticks rather than menus and windows. Lenovo says this is its most powerful handheld to ship natively with SteamOS. You get an 8.8-inch OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of storage with microSD expansion. What makes this model appealing is choice. Windows is there for flexibility and broad compatibility, while SteamOS is for players who want a cleaner, more predictable gaming experience without desktop friction. That mirrors what Lenovo already did with the Legion Go S, and it feels like a smart continuation of that strategy. Starting at $1,199 and launching around June 2026, the SteamOS Legion Go 2 is clearly positioned above the Steam Deck on price. Lenovo is aiming at players who want top-tier handheld hardware and prefer SteamOS to do exactly one thing well: play games. Dreame returned to CES 2026 with a clear goal: refine its flagship robot vacuum without making compromises. The X60 Max Ultra builds on last year’s stair-climbing concept and pushes it further, letting the robot roll over obstacles up to 8.8cm high. That still will not handle a full staircase, but it is enough to deal with raised thresholds, room dividers, and other problem spots that usually stop a robot in its tracks. Dreame really managed to slim things down with this new model. The X60 Max Ultra measures just 7.95cm tall, making it the company’s lowest-profile robot yet. To pull that off, Dreame uses a retracting LiDAR system that lowers itself when the robot moves under furniture, then pops back up to maintain full mapping accuracy. Paired with the latest OmniSight navigation system, Dreame claims significantly faster path planning and more confident object recognition. Mobility is handled by the new FlexiAdapt system, which uses retractable legs and swinging arms ahead of the wheels to lift the robot over raised surfaces instead of avoiding them. Combined with strong suction and a full mopping setup, the X60 is designed to clean more of your home in a single pass, rather than asking you to prep the space first. The high-end dock rounds things out with hot-water mop washing at 100°C, cutting down on odors and manual maintenance. Priced at $1,699, the Dreame X60 Max Ultra is firmly in flagship territory, but it earns that spot by tackling multiple real-world pain points all at once. Beatbot used CES 2026 to show just how far robotic pool care has progressed, and the AquaSense X is the clearest example yet. AquaSense is a system designed to make pool maintenance feel close to self-managing, from cleaning to post-cycle upkeep. The standout feature is the AstroRinse Cleaning Station, a self-cleaning dock that automatically rinses the robot’s internal filter, flushes debris into a sealed bag, and starts recharging once a cycle is finished. For pool owners, this removes one of the most annoying parts of robotic cleaning. No more handling wet filters or rinsing debris by hand after every run. The large-capacity debris bag is built to last weeks between emptying, even with frequent cleaning. Beatbot AI 2.0 and HybridSense AI Vision combine cameras with infrared and ultrasonic sensors to identify dozens of debris types across the pool floor, walls, waterline, and surface. Navigation adapts dynamically to pool shape and depth, allowing a single cycle to handle areas that often require separate passes on other robots, including shallow ledges and surface debris. At $4,250, the Beatbot AquaSense X is a premium product. But by addressing both cleaning and the maintenance that follows, it can conceivably take care of the pool in the background, which feels like the real next step for this category. TCL went all-in on premium TV performance at CES 2026 with the X11L Series, a flagship Mini LED TV that is clearly aimed at ending the usual OLED versus LED debate. The X11L combines extreme brightness, deep black levels, and unusually accurate color in a well-rounded package. At the core of the X11L is TCL’s new SQD-Mini LED display system, built around Super Quantum Dots, a new UltraColor filter, and advanced color processing. Users get BT.2020 color coverage with far more consistency than we usually see from Mini LED panels. TCL pairs that color performance with up to 20,000 dimming zones and peak brightness hitting 10,000 nits. This combo of features should translate into intense highlights, strong contrast, and minimal blooming even in difficult scenes. TCL’s upgraded Halo Control System and new 26-bit backlight controller allow for tighter light control and cleaner shadow detail, while the TSR AI Processor handles motion, upscaling, clarity, and sound tuning. The panel itself is ultra-thin, just 0.8 inches (20mm) deep, with a flat back designed to sit flush on a wall, reinforced by an Art Mode that helps it blend into a living space when not in use. Audio is similarly ambitious. Bang and Olufsen tuning is built in, with the option to expand into a full wireless Dolby Atmos setup over time, including a subwoofer and surround speakers. Starting at $6,999 for the 75-inch model, the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED sets its own bar for what a no-compromise premium TV should look like in 2026. Razer brought one of the more unexpected ideas to CES with Project Motoko, a concept that asks a simple question: what if smart glasses worked just as well without sitting on your face. Instead of lenses, Motoko builds its AI experience into a pair of over-ear headphones that look and feel like regular wireless cans. The trick is a pair of forward-facing cameras embedded into the headphones, capturing a first-person view of the world around you. Motoko delivers the same kind of contextual help we have come to expect from smart glasses. Live translation, object recognition, price comparisons, directions, and weather updates all worked smoothly in demos. The system is not locked to a single assistant either, with support for platforms like Gemini, ChatGPT, and others depending on what you prefer. What makes Motoko stand out is the form factor. Unlike smart glasses, these headphones blend in. On the head, they feel like normal everyday headphones, and visually, nothing about them signals experimental tech. For people who like the idea of ambient AI help but do not want a visible wearable, that matters a lot. Project Motoko is still a concept, with no pricing or release details yet. If Razer decides to take this further, smart headphones could end up being a far more natural home for everyday AI than glasses ever were. LG Display showed off one of the most extreme gaming panels we’ve seen with a 27-inch OLED monitor panel built for pure speed. This is a QHD display that pushes refresh rates far beyond what most gamers have ever seen, topping out at a staggering 720Hz. The headline feature is Dynamic Frequency and Resolution, or DFR. This lets players choose what matters most in the moment. In Performance Mode, the panel runs at a full 720Hz for the smoothest possible motion. Switch to Resolution Mode, and it delivers QHD clarity at 540Hz, still far beyond today’s mainstream gaming monitors. Paired with a 0.02ms gray-to-gray response time, motion blur and latency are pushed to levels that LCD panels simply cannot match. Because this is OLED, image quality keeps up with the speed. The panel delivers perfect blacks, up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness, and near-complete DCI-P3 coverage with strong BT.2020 support. Color depth and contrast remain intact even at extreme refresh rates, which is not something high-speed panels have always managed in the past. LG Display also leaned into comfort, with flicker-free operation, reduced glare, and low blue light output to support longer play sessions. As a technology showcase, this 720Hz OLED panel sets a new ceiling for competitive gaming displays and signals where the very top end of esports hardware is heading next. Samsung expanded its PC ambitions at CES with the Galaxy Book 6 lineup, pairing Intel’s newest Panther Lake processors with a clearer performance hierarchy and the return of the Ultra model. The series includes the Galaxy Book 6, Book 6 Pro, and the Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, covering everything from thin-and-light productivity to heavy creative and gaming workloads. All models are built around Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips, delivering a sizable jump in performance and efficiency. The base and Pro models rely on Intel Arc integrated graphics, while the Galaxy Book 6 Ultra stands apart by offering NVIDIA RTX 50 series GPUs. The Ultra can also be configured with up to 64GB of memory, reinforcing its position as the most powerful Galaxy Book yet. Displays remain a strong point. The Pro and Ultra feature Samsung’s latest Dynamic AMOLED panels with high resolution, dynamic 120Hz refresh rates, strong brightness, and anti-reflective coatings. For battery, Samsung claims up to 30 hours of video playback on the Pro and Ultra. Design tweaks are subtle but intentional, including cleaner branding and a more uniform keyboard layout. Samsung has not yet announced pricing for the Galaxy Book 6 series. Availability begins later this month in select markets, with US sales expected to start in the spring. Lenovo continued its rollable push at CES 2026 with the Legion Pro Rollable Concept, a gaming laptop that takes the idea of an expanding display to an extreme. Built for esports and high-end gaming, this concept starts as a fairly normal 16-inch laptop and then unfurls into something much larger, turning into a desktop-style gaming screen on demand. The rollable PureSight OLED display can expand up to 24 inches in “Arena mode,” or stop at 21.5 inches in “Tactical mode” for setups where space is more limited. That flexibility is the real hook here. You can travel with a reasonably sized gaming laptop and still get a massive screen once you sit down to play. Lenovo uses a dual-motor system to extend the display smoothly, aiming to keep vibration and noise to a minimum during the transition. Under the hood, the concept is based on the Legion Pro 7i, which means top-tier hardware. Lenovo confirmed that the system is paired with Intel Core Ultra processors and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, making it clear this is not just a visual experiment. This is still very much a concept, and Lenovo has not said when or if it will reach production. Even so, it feels like a natural next step after the company’s first commercial rollable laptop. Pebble made an unexpected and welcome return to Las Vegas with the Pebble Round 2, a smartwatch that feels deliberately out of step with modern wearables, in the best way possible. It is a spiritual follow-up to the Pebble Time Round, keeping the same ultra-thin, lightweight circular design while fixing its biggest flaw with a much larger, edge-to-edge display. The new 1.3-inch e-paper screen completely changes how the watch feels day to day. Notifications are easier to read, watch faces finally have room to breathe, and visibility in bright light is excellent without relying on a backlight. Pebble sticking with e-paper is a clear statement that this watch prioritizes readability and battery life over flashy visuals. Comfort is where the Pebble Round 2 really stands apart. The case is extremely thin and light, to the point where it almost disappears on your wrist. For people with smaller wrists, or anyone tired of bulky smartwatches, this is refreshing. It feels closer to wearing a traditional watch than a mini computer. There are obvious omissions. No heart rate sensor, GPS, NFC, speaker, or fitness tracking. That is intentional. The Pebble Round 2 is designed to be a notification-first smartwatch with up to 14 days of battery life, nothing more. Pebble Round 2 costs $199 and is expected to start shipping in May. A collaboration between XREAL and ASUS, the ROG XREAL R1 is a gaming-first take on AR glasses that puts a high-refresh display directly in front of your eyes. This is not positioned as a general-purpose wearable. It is designed to function like a portable gaming monitor, and the hardware reflects that focus. Each lens features a 1080p micro-OLED display running at up to 240Hz, with latency rated at just three milliseconds. That combination makes fast motion feel smooth and responsive, closer to what you would expect from a dedicated gaming display than from a wearable. A wider 57-degree field of view helps the virtual screen feel more immersive without dominating your entire vision. The R1 fits neatly into ASUS’ gaming ecosystem. It connects over USB-C for simple plug-and-play use and pairs especially well with devices like the ROG Ally. A dedicated dock lets you switch between multiple inputs, while built-in head tracking allows the display to stay anchored in space as you move. Audio is handled through Bose-tuned speakers built into the arms, keeping the setup self-contained. Automatic electrochromic lens tinting adjusts to ambient light, making the glasses easier to wear across different environments. Pricing has not been announced yet, but availability is expected in the first half of 2026. Our annual Best of CES awards highlight products that stand out at the very top of the show. But the event has always been about more than established names and headline launches. It is also a proving ground for smaller teams and newer brands looking to break through with fresh ideas. To recognize that side of the show, we created the Best of CES 2026: Breakthrough Awards. The products below may not come from the biggest players, but each one brings something new to the table and shows real potential. Here are the 10 Best of CES 2026 Breakthrough Award winners. Keep an eye on them, as any of these could shape where tech goes next. Which of these products is your favorite? Let us know the top Best of CES 2026 award winner in the comments below, and stay tuned for more! Thank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting.

Business Paramount and Warner Bros logos are seen in this illustration taken December 8, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Jan 8 : Some ‌of Warner Bros Discovery's biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance's sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until Jan. 21 to accept Paramount's latest $108.4 billion proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of "Stranger Things" is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7 billion, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount's deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 per cent of Warner Bros, ‌as of Sept 30, agrees with the board. "The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already ‌been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent," Fitch said in an e-mail to Reuters.

Loading Though Paramount's offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it doesn't cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5 billion in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350 million in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, Chief Investment Officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board's decision to reject Paramount's offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The ‍deal would leave the combined company with $87 billion in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent Wednesday that the board "breached its fiduciary duty" to shareholders by rejecting Paramount's offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny.Warner Bros' board "is choosing not to inquire about what improvements ​Paramount is willing to make to its offer," he ‌said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario ​Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said ⁠its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path ‌to regulatory approval.“At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.”Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros' fifth-largest ​shareholder, remains open to changing its position. "If they (Paramount) come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage," Fitch said.It's not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO ‍Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes "Harry Potter" and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired ⁠the U.S. and Australian distribution rights to runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance "Heated Rivalry."Warner Bros' top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some ​22 per cent. All three are also among the ‌top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. All three fund firms declined to comment.

Title: Can Palantir Double Again in 2026? This Analyst Is Confident

Investing Palantir (PLTR) trades at 180 times forward earnings despite expected sales growth slowing from 54% to 42%. Palantir reports full-year 2025 results on February 2nd. The stock has stalled near $180 after reaching $200 in October. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Palantir could reach a $1 trillion valuation within two to three years. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / Piotr Swat Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) stock has made remarkably little progress in the past few months. It is below the level it was in August 2025, so concerns about a plateau seem quite valid. The momentum that carried it from $20 in April 2024 to over $200 in October 2025 seems lost. That said, no one knows what kind of paradigm shift 2026 may bring for the company as defense tech spending remains hot. The business itself is humming on strong, with the full-year 2025 plus Q4 report expected to be out on the 2nd of February. This may reinvigorate the bulls and push the stock beyond $200 again if Palantir reports another blockbuster quarter. But some analysts believe $200 is just a stepping stone to an even more ambitious valuation: $1 trillion. Let’s first look at where Palantir stands today before we explore the analyst’s argument. Among big companies, Palantir is the one you have to pay the most for, by far. Analysts who have been ringing the bell on an AI bubble expect Palantir to be the first domino to fall, even ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). That’s because, unlike Nvidia, the stock price is far ahead of the earnings curve. Buying PLTR stock at ~$180 today means you’re paying for results over a decade in advance. PLTR stock trades at almost 180 times forward earnings. Even on a free cash flow basis, you’re paying in excess of 130 times FCF. In comparison, NVDA stock trades at 25 times forward earnings with stronger and more durable sales growth. A software company like Palantir is not in the intersection of the AI infrastructure buildout and mostly relies on an increasing number of customers. The company can scale once it gets its foot in the door, but there’s only so much market it can capture. Analysts thus expect sales growth to come down a notch from ~54% for all of 2025 to ~42% in 2026. EPS growth is also expected to come down from 77% to less than 40% this year. In short, you may not be getting your money’s worth. The idea is that AI will be rapidly adopted across U.S. commercial companies, with Palantir being the “default” enterprise AI platform. This may allow it to grow much faster than expected, with Wall Street slapping an even higher premium. And the idea does have some meat to it. If the market was comfortable paying over 200 times forward earnings, 400, or even 500, may not look too ridiculous until the music stops. The most well-known analyst pushing this is Dan Ives from Wedbush, who believes Palantir can be a $1 trillion company within “two to three years”. He has advised investors to “triple down” on the stock. A lesser-known analyst, Will McGough from Prime Capital, also believes PLTR can reach a $1 trillion market cap. The likelihood of PLTR stock doubling in 2026 is minuscule. If the AI rally accelerates this year, PLTR Palantir can cross $200 again, and perhaps $250, but even with blockbuster earnings and an unceasing rally, doubling the market cap from here is unrealistic. The stock has been losing momentum, so a $1 trillion valuation in even two years is extremely unlikely at this point. Software AI stocks are seeing maturing valuations, and the market is likely to let the earnings catch up to the sky-high valuations first before slapping a bigger premium. The worst-case scenario would be if the AI rally ends this year. There’s plenty of profit to be taken, and the market will hurriedly punish the stock, especially if Palantir cannot sustain the beat-and-raise cadence for dozens of quarters as expected. All things considered, it is much safer to buy AI hardware stocks. For software AI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains my top bet. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: BlackRock adds $900M BTC as Bitcoin long-term selling falls to 2017 lows

BlackRock added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-year drawdown in 2025 and pointing to early signs of BTC accumulation. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s fresh round of Bitcoin (BTC) buying takes place alongside a sharp slowdown in long-term selling, a combination that points to cooling downside pressure after the recent market pullback in Q4. Key takeaways: BlackRock added nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin in the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-2025 drawdown. Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling at their lowest rate since 2017, despite elevated prices. Onchain data pointed to a possible accumulation phase among certain wallet cohorts. Data from Lookonchain indicated BlackRock has accumulated Bitcoin for the past three days, adding 9,619 BTC valued at roughly $878 million. The asset management company currently holds about 780,400 BTC, worth $70 billion. BlackRock’s BTC holdings peaked on Nov. 30 at about 804,000 BTC. At the time, that position was valued at roughly $96.5 billion. Although holdings fell to 771,000 BTC by Jan. 1, BlackRock has swiftly added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January. The institutional buying coincided with a notable shift among long-term holders. Bitcoin’s Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance has fallen to its lowest level since 2017, signaling that older coins are barely moving onto exchanges. For context, long-term holder supply dropped to 13.6 million in November 2025 from over 15 million in July 2025. Over the past couple of months, the long-term supply has not decreased further. Onchain data from CryptoQuant helps explain this shift. The SOPR Ratio, which broadly compares whether recent buyers and long-term holders are selling at a profit or loss, has dropped to levels associated with market resets. Newer participants are selling at losses, while long-term holders remain profitable and largely inactive. This pattern reflects a clean-up phase after sharp rallies, where speculative positions unwind, and coins change hands at lower prices. With Bitcoin down roughly 20% to 25% from its highs, this dynamic can mark the early stages of accumulation, provided selling pressure from recent buyers continues to drop. Related: Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF could offer strategic value beyond inflows, analysts say Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) added another layer of context. The metric currently sits near the 0.3 level, a zone that has historically marked transitions from recovery into more constructive market conditions. Holders, on average, are back in moderate profit, but the market remains far from the excess seen near major cycle tops. This positioning suggests a cautious transition phase rather than a clear breakout. Confidence appears to be rebuilding, but broader confirmation on both onchain and market structure would be needed before a stronger move.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr Is Back!!: Nvidia’s $20B Groq Grab, Meta’s $2.5B Manus Play, and Why “Invisible Unemployment” Will Define 2026
URL: https://www.saastr.com/20vc-x-saastr-is-back-nvidias-20b-groq-grab-metas-2-5b-manus-play-and-why-invisible-unemployment-will-define-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T17:21:49Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The latest from the 20VC x SaaStr collaboration with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll Jensen Huang wanted the deal done before Christmas. He got it in two weeks. Nvidia just dropped $20 billion on Groq—a company doing sub-$50 million in revenue—because when you’re protecting a $3.5 trillion market cap, 1% is a rounding error. Meanwhile, Meta paid $2.5 billion for Manus (25x ARR), Yan LeCun is calling Alex Wang “naive and inexperienced,” and somewhere in America, Stanford CS grads are discovering that a degree from the best university in the world doesn’t guarantee a job anymore. Welcome to 2026: the year of spite startups, 24/7 AI inference, and “invisible unemployment” that won’t show up in the government numbers but will reshape everything. Jensen didn’t buy Groq for its $175 million in revenue. He bought it to eliminate margin pressure on a $100 billion annual cash flow machine. “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia,” Rory explained. “This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table.” The math is brutal in its simplicity: $20 billion is less than 1% of Nvidia’s market cap and less than 20% of annual free cash flow. For that price, they neutralize a competitor, acquire Jonathan Ross (inventor of Google’s TPU), and close the whole thing before the holiday party. The kicker? 3x the last round is the traditional “remove all objections and close instantly” price. Jensen knew exactly what he was doing. Benchmark turned a controversial bet into a 5x return in 8 months. But the real story is why the founders sold at $2.5 billion when they were doing 125 million run rate and growing fast. “This was a local maximum deal,” Jason argued. “Best of breed orchestration layer, but Anthropic can do some of this. OpenAI is going to do some of this. They’re all running multiple LLMs. They’re all orchestrating multiple agents.” The founders owned 80% of the company. At $2.5 billion, they each walked away with roughly half a billion dollars. In Singapore. With 0% capital gains tax. “In the end, words are words and half a billion dollars is life-changing,” Rory added. “At some point the entrepreneur can turn to you and say: if you think $2.5 billion is underpriced, don’t cash out my $500 million—give me $50 million off the table.” Anthropic was born from spite with OpenAI. XAI was born from spite. Now Yan LeCun is potentially starting another spite startup after publicly calling out Meta’s AI strategy. “If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite,” Jason declared. “This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” But it goes deeper than founder feuds. Jason argues many CEOs are driven by spite about how they were forced to run companies in 2021—the “kumbaya work at home” era that let the world pass them by. “Zuck is spiteful he was forced to run the company in a certain way. He may burn every last penny he has, but some of it’s out of spite that they got this far behind.” OpenAI is spending 46% of revenue on stock-based compensation—34x higher than comparable pre-IPO tech companies. The panel’s take? It makes total sense. “If you’re a CEO and you have zero shares, you don’t worry about dilution,” Jason noted. “Sam just wants to build the biggest greatest AI company on planet Earth. If he dilutes everyone 99%, it doesn’t impact him at all as a shareholder.” Rory added the historical perspective: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.'” The real tell? Even with $1.5 million average compensation, OpenAI still only has 60% retention among researchers. The talent wars have thrown all conventions out the window. SoftBank closed its $40 billion OpenAI investment on December 29th. Days later, the position was already up 2-3x on paper. “The level of risk tolerance that guy has is just amazing,” Rory said. “He had the right to put $40 billion in OpenAI. Now I better find the money by selling other stuff. He’s scurrying right down to the line to find the money the week before Christmas.” But here’s the real insight: Masa is now the only double-digit percentage shareholder in what could be the most important company of the next decade. Entry price was high, but ownership percentage at this stage is nearly impossible to achieve. “His greatest play ever was Alibaba—getting 20% and holding it for 20 years,” Jason said. “But if OpenAI goes to the moon, this may be his best deal ever. He had to enter later, but he got his double digits. It’s not easy to get double digits at this stage.” OpenAI is developing a pen-like device with a camera and microphone. Johnny Ive is involved. The initial reaction was skepticism—but Jason sees something bigger. “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to.” The insight: When we’re all running AI 24/7—multiple agents, continuous inference, persistent memory across every conversation—we’ll want our AI companion with us everywhere. Not as a note-taking device, but as a permanently present intelligence that knows everything about our lives. “When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” Navan went public and promptly dropped to 4x ARR. A 27% growth company with positive non-GAAP operating income trading at 4x revenue should be a win—but the circumstances tell a different story. “Maybe Navan only IPO’d because it was their least best bad option,” Jason suggested. “700 million in debt, only 200 million in cash. It had to IPO to pay off its debt.” The lesson: If you’re not Figma or better, it’s going to be rough out there. The IPO window isn’t open—it’s barely cracked. And companies like Stripe, Databricks, and Revolut are proving that staying private might just be the smarter play. “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets,” Rory argued. “They can look the public markets in the eye and say: ‘You guys just aren’t a compelling product.'” This might be the most important insight of the episode. Jason sees a massive labor market shift that won’t show up in government statistics—but will reshape tech and society. “Shopify saying for the third year in a row they can hit insane growth without adding any headcount. Every single CEO wanting to keep headcount flat and backfill with AI. This is not robots firing us. This is tighter and tighter companies, radically higher ARR per employee.” The most vulnerable? Entry-level knowledge workers and senior executives who can’t reskill. “If you’re top of your class in math at any school, you will be found by Anthropic and OpenAI. They will find you. But for the other 99% of your class—why do I need you with Claude Code? Why do I need any SDRs? We don’t need any of them.” IBM reported turnover of almost 2% last year. “No one left IBM because they know they got no other job.” Revolut is doing $3.5 billion in profit. Stripe kicks off billions in free cash flow. Databricks just raised at $62 billion. Why would any of them go public? “If you can take out $400 million a year yourself just as a dividend, that’s enough for many of us,” Jason pointed out. “He can play the bank dividend card. At when you’re producing $3.5 billion, what does he own? 18%. Just say I’m going to dividend it out.” The panel identified two distinct categories now: traditional late-stage (companies that can’t yet go public) and what Jason calls “Post-IPO Scale Still Private”—companies that could go public but actively choose not to. “If I was running NASDAQ or NYSE: Why is our product so uncompelling to Ali at Databricks that he got all the way to $150 billion in enterprise value before he thought going public was a good idea?” The scariest insight: Young, driven founders know exactly who the other driven people are in their cohort. And with AI reducing headcount requirements, they never have to lower the bar. “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent,” Rory observed. “The 25-year-old founder knows the five people in his class who were smart and the 95 who didn’t grind—and he’s only going to hire the ones who were smart.” Previously, companies needed 300 people to reach $100 million in revenue. If you can get there with 30, you never have to compromise on culture, work ethic, or talent quality. “If you don’t need 300 people to get to $100 million in revenue anymore, you just don’t need 300 people. So you don’t have to give. So that means no jobs for those people.” On the spite economy: “For venture, this is the era of the spite startup. Anthropic’s a spite startup, XAI and Twitter’s a spite startup. Now we’ve got Meta’s AI guy who’s doing a new spite startup. If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite. This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” On invisible unemployment: “I call it invisible unemployment and it’s all around us. It doesn’t show up in the government numbers yet, but it’s everywhere. This is the year where we will see the end of so many entry-level sales jobs. We still need AEs. We still need people knocking on doors. We do not need 21 and 22-year-old kids sending emails. Those jobs will disappear.” On AI naming itself: “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to. When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” On Nvidia’s defensive acquisition: “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia. This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table. $20 billion is less than 1% of their market cap and less than 20% of their annual free cash flow. For that, we can buy up a competitor and eliminate that potential margin pressure.” On OpenAI compensation: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.’ Sometimes the budget doesn’t matter. No one remembers the budget for World War II. Winning is the only thing.” On founder vs. VC alignment: “Trying to persuade a founder to hold on when they don’t want to is a very hard thing to do. And arguably you shouldn’t even try. In the end, 90% of the time the founder controls the exit decision and the 10% of the time they don’t, it’s usually a mistake for the VCs to try and control it.” On public market dysfunction: “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets.” On the Manus deal math: “If we’re on the Manus board, it’s doing 100 million now. Say it does 3x given the growth rates—that’s only 8x end of year revenues next year. It does feel quite cheap.” On young founders judging talent: “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent. The founder at 25—they’re marked to market on their team and on other people they know. That’s the generation they grew up with. They’re finding these new companies now and they’re going to hire the best and they’re going to discard the rest.” The 20VC x SaaStr collaboration continues.

Title: Slightly more Americans file for jobless benefits in the last week of 2025, but layoffs remain low

By MATT OTT WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. filings for jobless benefits rose in the last week of 2025 but remain historically low, despite signs that the labor market is weakening. The number of Americans filing for jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 3 rose by 8,000 to 208,000, up from 200,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was right in line with what analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. The government’s December jobs report will be released Friday, with analysts expecting that the U.S. added 55,000 non-farm jobs. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the 12 months ended in March. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 7,250 to 211,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 27 jumped by 56,000 to 1.91 million, the government said.

Angi said Wednesday that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In an SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Angie's List got its start in the 1990s as a database to help homeowners find contractors for projects such as home improvement and lawn care. The company, which rebranded in 2021 as Angi, had about 2,800 employees at the end of 2024, according to its latest annual filing. Executives at tech companies from Amazon to Salesforce have said that they are replacing at least some human workers with AI in recent months. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist known as "the godfather of AI," predicted that job losses from AI will claim even more jobs in 2026. Jump to

Title: Why BlackRock’s $1B crypto bet could shape markets in 2026

BlackRock’s latest move signals a pivotal moment for the 2026 bull cycle – Here’s what you should know. BlackRock has officially ended its silence. After a period of strategic inactivity, the world’s largest asset manager has re‑entered the market, beginning a high‑conviction accumulation phase. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that over the last 72 hours, BlackRock has absorbed nearly $1 billion in digital assets. The firm transferred 9,619 BTC valued at $878 million and 46,851 ETH worth $149 million into its custody. This three-day blitz signals a decisive pivot from the choppy outflows of late 2025 into a concentrated ‘ETF 2.0’ era for 2026. To understand why BlackRock goes through long periods of flatlining followed by massive spikes, let’s view the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a global liquidity grocery store. During mute weeks, the store isn’t empty; it’s simply operating off the inventory kept in the backroom. In technical terms, this is the secondary market buffer. Authorized Participants (APs) often hold a surplus of shares or Bitcoin [BTC], allowing them to satisfy buy orders without the ETF ever needing to interact with the underlying spot market. To the outside observer, BlackRock appears inactive. But, in reality, the backroom supply is being quietly absorbed by investors. This is when the accumulation week triggers as the shelves run bare. When internal liquidity is exhausted or when quarterly rebalancing cycles converge, BlackRock is forced to enter the spot market to restock. This creates the massive green bars we see in the data, not necessarily representing a sudden change in sentiment, but the visible fulfillment of weeks of pent-up institutional demand. Needless to say, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF also falls into the same analysis. This comes at a time when, after a surge of optimism kicked off 2026, the market has hit a technical speed bump. Despite the three-day accumulation streak, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded outflows worth $130 million, cooling off from the inflows seen in the first week of the New Year. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETHA also saw $6.6 million in outflows this week, following a strong opening week. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the market was feeling the weight of this consolidation. Bitcoin was trading at $90,245.14, down by 2.41% in 24 hours, while Ethereum [ETH] has slipped to $3,118.03, a 4.99% drop during the same period. When such movements happen, these prices typically move sideways. The lack of aggressive selling from institutional giants prevents a total collapse, stabilizing the market at these higher valuations. For traders, this is the calm before the shock. History also shows that once BlackRock finishes this quiet accumulation, the resulting supply squeeze is often what pushes Bitcoin through major resistance levels, like the current $94,500 barrier.

Share this article BlackRock, the global investment management firm, moved about 3,064 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $276 million, along with 26,723 Ethereum worth more than $83 million, to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The latest transfers come as ETF flows in early 2026 turned volatile, with strong inflows at the start of January quickly giving way to sharp outflows. After solid buying on Jan 2 and Jan 5, sentiment reversed sharply on Jan 6 and Jan 7, resulting in net outflows for the period, per Farside Investors. IBIT, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, posted $130 million in redemptions yesterday as US spot Bitcoin funds suffered $486 million in net outflows, their biggest daily outflow since late November.

Dominic D’Agostino: Great to see you, Tim. Thanks for connecting. Tim Ferriss: So I suggested — definitely — I suggested we hop on the phone because I have been harassing the living hell out of you with so many questions via text message. And I thought, this must be pretty annoying. So rather than answer me once, why don’t we hop on and record a bunch of the details because the details are so fascinating. And for people who are just tuning in who might not know the good doctor, D’Agostino, “Dom” Dominic, we should establish some basics. And I at this point have been quote-unquote in ketosis for 18 days now. And we’ll dig into a lot of questions around that, tactical practical questions. But before we do, why would someone — and we can talk about what it is and so on, but first let’s just give some of the — let’s call it established benefits ideally in human studies, but could extend to animal models. And then, if there’s anything on the horizon, say in the next few years, because you’re at the cutting edge, if you think there’s anything that might plausibly be established as a benefit, what could that be? So what would you put on the bullet list of benefits of intermittently or for extended periods of time, being in ketosis? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, there are many benefits to being in ketosis and a ketogenic diet, if we’re going to go there, kind of has the benefits of fasting. And for millennia, we know the benefits of fasting, without the baggage, without the metabolic baggage. The muscle loss, the fatigue, obviously, you can’t live in that level of caloric deficit. But in regards to the practical applications of it, we know that being in a state of ketosis really quiets the mind. And I think that has major implications. And this was from centuries we knew this. And now over the past decades, this has been like a term kind of used. And it’s backed up by experimental data to show that there’s an elevation of GABA. Obviously, it’s silencing a broad array of seizures independent of the etiology, temporal lobe seizures. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, rare forms of epilepsy. The ketogenic diet just quiets the brain, lowers glutamate, and elevates GABA, a brain stabilizing, calming neurotransmitter. And that’s why people gravitate towards alcohol, right? The GABA-ergic effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. So you can sort of, in a very gentle way, transition your physiology to a state of ketosis, which changes the neuropharmacology of your brain to sort of quiet it down. And that, I think, really echoes its broad application for metabolic psychiatry, which is everything from major depression to bipolar, to schizophrenia, to anxiety disorders, to anorexia nervosa. So that’s a very interesting and rapidly expanding application of ketosis that’s being funded largely by the Baszucki Group. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Had David on. And on the physical side, some folks, if they’re old enough, may remember the Atkins diet. Not saying that is what we should hold up as the necessarily the end all be all of any sense, but why would someone go on this for benefits outside of the cognitive psychiatric? Are there any other benefits that you could list off? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I think first and foremost, it’s weight loss. So it’s very satisfying to go into a state of ketosis because you do see the scale change pretty dramatically, and that’s due in part to some fluid loss associated with a reduction of fluid volume. So it does have a diuretic effect. Ketosis does, ketogenic diets and obviously fasting, and also a natriuretic effect where you dump out some sodium. Your plasma volume, your blood volume will contract a little bit. So if you have high blood pressure, that will likely go down. So if you’re on blood pressure medication, you have to think about that. But first and foremost, it’s an effective way to get your body to lower the hormone insulin, if you have insulin resistance, and shift your metabolism to burning fats. And as we burn more and more fat, that stimulates the production of ketones, ketogenesis. And ketones have a broad array of applications, metabolic signaling epigenetic that have real world applications. And that’s why the whole field of exogenous ketones has developed and there’s 160 or more registered clinical trials on exogenous ketones, on clinicaltrials.gov. So yeah. And I could go into each of the applications individually if we want to go there. Tim Ferriss: Well, as we talked about before recording, and I’ll have to act as a bit of a referee for my audience because I know you can go as deep as we want down the rabbit hole into the 17 dimensions of biochemistry. So if you get possessed by the organic chemistry demons and start speaking in tongues, I’ll reign you in a little bit. However, let me perhaps provide a personal example first for folks because some of this will be familiar to people who’ve listened for a long time, maybe to other episodes of the two of us. But a lot of it’s going to be new. But I want to establish some priors just so people are aware of what this might look like in practice. So I have experimented with the ketogenic diet, also extended fasting, and you can arrive at some similar places, but like you said, Dom, there can be some pretty heavy taxes to pay with extended fasting. The ketogenic diet, I’ve experimented with all the way back to the ’90s. Some of you weren’t even born probably who are listening, but some of you will remember the ’90s. And I was using it specifically for mood stabilizing. This was towards the end of college, but also to lean out while building muscle on something called the cyclical ketogenic or ketogenic diet. So we’re going to get to that later in the conversation, but it was effectively, let’s call it six days of focusing on a ketogenic diet with one day or a half to three quarters of a day of glycogen depletion and then, loading with more carbohydrates, lower fat, et cetera. The reason that the ketogenic diet became doubly interesting to me is that when I had Lyme disease the second time, which came with all sorts of co-infections like babesiosis and so on. And this isn’t chronic fatigue or depression searching for a diagnosis that is external. I feel like sometimes the cottage industry of diagnosing and treating people for quote-unquote Lyme disease can be shady at best. But in this case, I’m coming from Long Island. Everybody in my family has had tickborne disease and was credibly diagnosed. So the second time I had Lyme, I got to a point — because I did not see the bullseye rash, assumed I did not have it, which is a mistake because sometimes you don’t see the dermatological response and you nonetheless have contracted something like Lyme disease. I ended up weeks later slurring my speech, took me minutes to get out of bed because my joints hurt so much, forgetting friends’ names. And my assistant said, “Tim, you really need to see someone. This isn’t fatigue. I’ve seen you sick. I’ve seen you tired. This is something else.” And suffice to say, that turned into several months, even post antibiotic treatment, which I do think is important, of we could call it pseudo dementia. I mean, I really felt like I was operating at 10 percent cognitive capacity. And basically at my wit’s end, I said, “Well, what can I control? Because a lot has not done the job.” And I went into strict ketosis. What does that mean? That means that I’m consuming moderate protein, probably getting at least 50 percent of my calories from fat and keeping my carbohydrates to less than 20 grams a day probably at that point. And within three or four days, I’d probably say around day three or four, because I wasn’t very fat adapted at the time. My body wasn’t well-trained to use fat because I wasn’t doing intermittent fasting, which we’ll come back to. And within three or four days, effectively, all of my cognitive symptoms disappeared. And I stayed in that state through nutritional ketosis for a few weeks, had complete remission of any of the cognitive symptoms plus the joint pain symptoms, and those never came back. And I recommended that, and this is not a randomized controlled trial, but over the years, as due to various factors, we’ve had ticks growing in population, also expanding to the coasts and on the West Coast that is, and elsewhere, had three friends replicate this with ketosis after suffering various symptoms from tickborne disease. And we were texting, maybe even talking about this, but I never had a great explanation for why it worked. I said, “I don’t know the exact mechanism. Maybe I have faulty glucose metabolism that was somehow — maybe something was impaired by the ticks and therefore I’m giving my brain this alternate fuel that it really likes ketones,” but it didn’t explain, necessarily, the durability of the changes. In brief, do you have a theory or an explanation for why that would work? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I’m glad you brought that up because quickly dozens, if not hundreds of people with tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease and all the tickborne diseases have communicated with me. And one of the patients is actually Deanna Tedone, who was diagnosed with ALS prior to 2010, and has basically been stabilized given three years to live. So I realized that it’s underdiagnosed, the tests to do that are kind of controversial with the CDC testing, the two-tiered testing, and IGeneX. So I know I’m going off track a little bit here, but yes, I think it’s important to say that the spirochete, Borrelia, that spirochete is essentially 100 percent glycolytic. And when you limit glucose availability and glycolysis, you are targeting the energy systems of that microbe. So that’s one thing to think about. And it’s well established now. It wasn’t three years ago, but a ketogenic diet in particular, beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated in the blood, stimulates the adaptive immune response. And that’s essentially your body’s ability to target foreign invaders and neutralize them. And that has become a rapidly growing area of interest. University of Pennsylvania, just — they’re doing CAR-T therapy and checkpoint inhibitors because of the ketogenic enhancement of the adaptive immune response. So I think that plays a role. And situationally, I have observed that you go into ketosis if you have an inflammatory process and Lyme disease is inflammatory. But people who have shingles and herpes simplex and things like that, I have an inbox full of people that do that. And I would like to experimentally go down that direction to understand why. But I think there’s two reasons you’re targeting the energy systems and you’re augmenting the immune response to keep the spirochete in a dormant stage or maybe eradicating it in some context. PREROLL? Tim Ferriss: It’s really incredible on a whole lot of levels. And I’m just lucky that I had the prior experience with the ketogenic diet to even have it occur to me as a last ditch effort. And for people just to — if it wasn’t clear, I mean, you explained it clearly, but glycolytic, I’m simplifying here, but it means that something needs to eat sugar or metabolize carbohydrates to survive, right? And there are also, Dom, correct me if I’m wrong, but particular cancers that are very sensitive to being starved of glucose as well. And for people who want more on sort of fasting ketosis as it relates to cancer, we may come back to it also, but we’ve had prior conversations about this and the benefits, some of the incredible effects of fasting prior to cancer treatments of various types.PREROLLSo is it fair to say, do you think most of the benefits that someone would derive from fasting prior to cancer treatments, they could also get from ketosis or is it dialed back to a smaller percentage of effect? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, that’s a good question. I think it requires a nuanced answer that we probably don’t have time for. But if you are overweight and your BMI, for example, is like — as many cancer patients tend to be like 28, 30, 32, a fasting or a calorically restricted ketogenic diet is the way to go. If a patient is trending towards being lighter, like a BMI, 20, 22, something like that, a eucaloric, meaning like keeping stable caloric level to maintain your weight is going to be important. And then elevating beta-hydroxybutyrate will be important to get some of the anti-inflammatory effects and also the immune boosting effects and the neuroprotective effects going into cancer therapy because there’s people studying ketosis for chemo brain, like reversing chemo brain and like managing that. So it has a broad array of applications, not just targeting — it’s targeting the tumor growth and putting a break on it. It’s not a cure for cancer, and I cringe when people talk about that like online, the ketogenic diet curing cancer, it does slow it down, especially if it’s highly glycolytic, which 80 percent of cancers are. And it enhances and augments the response to the standard of care that’s radiation, chemo and immune-based therapies. So we know that now. Tim Ferriss: All right. Why have I been in ketosis for 18 days and why am I doing it a few times a year? Well, part of how I implement this does hinge and will continue to hinge on some of the answers in this conversation, because this is very self-interested. But what I have found is that for mood stabilization, and you mentioned metabolic psychiatry, and you made the introduction, I believe, Chris Palmer out of Harvard on the podcast to discuss this. But there’s certain conditions, whether it’s depression, but even more squirrelly when you’re dealing with something like schizophrenia, for instance, or different types of bipolar, people who’ve been on dozens of medications who go into, let’s call it remission, or they no longer meet the criteria for the diagnosis of some of these things after being treated on a ketogenic diet, of one type or another. It is astonishing. And so for my own mental health, I’ve noticed complete stabilization and without subduing the highs, right? I’ve never had mania necessarily, I’m not talking about that, but I’m not muted. I feel just calm, stable, sharp and that’s one reason in and of itself to do it for periods of time, but I seem to feel a carryover effect, also have Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases in my family. I have three relatives with rapidly advancing Alzheimer’s at the moment. So maybe we could talk also to how these things might intersect. But my feeling is possibly, and I’d love your input here, if I follow a ketogenic diet for a number of weeks or maybe a month and a half or something like that, I’d love to know the timing you might recommend. Let’s say I do that two or three times a year, that there could be enduring effects that have sort of a protective carryover, right? And I also find it much easier now that I started doing intermittent — I’ve been in intermittent fasting pretty much every day for the last six months, which means I’m eating between typically 2:00 p.m. and like 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and having two meals a day, that’s it. Not hungry at all. I haven’t eaten today, it’s 12:30 my time, I will not be hungry for another two, two and a half hours. That by itself completely revolutionized. I mean, that’s an overused word, but completely polished my insulin sensitivity and metabolic health on a bunch of levels. My labs have never been better. My oral glucose tolerance test has never been better. And one question I have for you, which is just for Timmy, Tim, Tim, but will apply to other people is, is there an argument to be made, and maybe I’m totally off base, but that if you follow a ketogenic diet and make it work for a multi-week period of time, that you’re changing your metabolic machinery or just your body in some way that has carryover effects, even after you stop the diet, or is that me just doing some hand wavy fancy footwork as a muggle? I don’t know if there’s a there, there, but what are your thoughts? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I would say absolutely. I think the science is still working to clarify that and make it less ambiguous, the benefits that we are deriving from that. But that is kind of like one of the pitches for the fasting mimicking diet by Dr. Valter Longo, who was one of our keynote speakers at Metabolic Health Summit, and he’s presented some really compelling research on that, that opened my eyes to that five days of fasting can have — I think he presented a time, even three months of effects on sort of cardiometabolic biomarkers. Tim Ferriss: And in his case, this would be the fast mimicking diet, so a few hundred calories a diet, of — yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, like 600, using his protocol of various foods, kind of gravitating towards more of a plant-based lower protein strategy. And I think that it’s promoting metabolic flexibility and ramping up fatty acid oxidation enzymes. And much like muscle memory, I think there’s a metabolic memory. So the more you stay in ketosis, the easier it gets and the more benefits you derive from it and the more that you shift your body to being more fat adapted, just like you can build your VO2. When you build your VO2 max or you build up to like a 400-pound bench press and you take like months off and you go back and you can only do like 225 for a couple reps, it only takes like two or three months to get back, but it took you 10 years to get there. That muscle memory snaps back quick and everybody agrees that there’s this metabolic memory and I think there’s a lot of things at play, including gene programs, epigenetic regulation that comes to play. So first and foremost is changing our mitochondrial function and mitochondrial capacity. So the number of mitochondria increase, and then when you take a break and then stimulate, get that stimulation again, that mitochondria is kind of there and it responds very rapidly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thank you for that. And I mean, I want a bookmark, maybe we come back to this, but if people are trying to think about this, understanding that the science right now is maybe provisional or there’s a little bit, hypothesis worth disproving at this point, but that it seems to make sense from an evolutionary perspective that both muscle memory and metabolic memory would be a thing. Otherwise, it makes sense your body would want to adapt to be prepared for the next famine or whatever it might be, right? If there is a — Dominic D’Agostino: I just want to say muscle memory is metabolic memory. So someone — I gave the analogy of like lifting weights, but someone who runs marathons, it’s the same scenario. They take time off and then that VO2 max quickly establishes again and it’s muscle, but it’s metabolic. So I like to use the term metabolic memory. Tim Ferriss: Metabolic memory. Okay. Yeah, metabolic memory. So just so people know where I am at the moment and actually, yeah, I’ll just tell people what I’m doing because I know they’re probably getting itchy for some just like, what does this look like in practice? And then, I want to talk a bit about how ketosis or the ketogenic diet may or may not be helpful for maybe not treating, maybe treating. I’ve certainly seen some interesting effects in some of my relatives when I give them exogenous ketones where suddenly their sentences are three or four times longer, 30 minutes later, which is wild to see. But in terms of prevention or staving off the onset of some of these diseases, I’d love to hear your perspective. But let me tell people what I’ve been doing for the last few months, and especially in the last 18 days. So for the last whatever it is, I think I mentioned six months, I’ve been doing intermittent fasting. And that was after hearing a conversation between Dr. Rhonda Patrick, who I’m a big fan of, and Mark Mattson, M-A-T-T-S-O-N, who’s done a lot of research related to intermittent fasting. And the key piece for me, because you see all of these different types of intermittent fasting, all of these different ways to do time restricted feeding, and I am going to paraphrase here. So Mark, I apologize if I’m getting this wrong or oversimplifying, but in effect, it’s important that you fast, this means no calories, or we could talk about pure fat, but let’s just assume you’re not consuming any calories for 16 hours because you want to deplete your liver of glycogen. And once you deplete your liver of glycogen, your body experiences this metabolic switching. And I’ve certainly felt this just doing intermittent fasting where my meals contain carbohydrates later, that around the end of that fasting period, boom, something switches and my mind is sharper, right? And then when I got to the point of going into the ketogenic diet this time and also a few months ago, because I was doing the intermittent fasting, and it took me about a week and a half for my body to get comfortable with that, at which point it was no problem. But I was a little pissy, a little irritable for a little while, a little foggy. And then when I went into the ketogenic diet this time, it was the easiest transition I’ve ever had. I did not have any fogginess, I did not have low energy, I did not have what some people might call the kind of keto flu adaptive period, which seems to be pretty remediated or addressed with electrolytes for a lot of people, but it was incredibly easy. Just straight into the ketogenic diet with no problem because I was already doing the intermittent fasting. And then for 18 days, I’ve been having two meals a day and you’ve recommended a few that sound frankly pretty disgusting, but that are actually really easy, like two cans of canned mackerel with about two tablespoons, 30 milliliters of MCT oil plus apple cider vinegar with some salt and pepper. It’s actually delicious. I just love mackerel. There it is. Yeah, you’ve got your apple cider vinegar right there. Dominic D’Agostino: Cheap stuff you can get on Amazon. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. For people who might think, “Oh, wow, this is what for fancy people who can do all sorts of expensive things in their diet,” we’re talking about like, how much does that meal cost, three bucks? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, a dollar a can for that Chicken of the Sea. And literally you get almost a pound of mackerel, and this is like third-party tested very low chub mackerel, the little mackerel, less — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: So yeah, you got like a $1.50 for almost a pound of mackerel that you can get that for. And the omega-3s are off the charts, the heavy metals are low. I consume pounds of this stuff and I’ve gotten my blood and my hair heavy metals tested and it’s like super low, like non-detected. So I wouldn’t worry about that. People have questions about cost and heavy metals and that’s a non-issue for me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And maybe you could mention, I’ll put links in the show notes as well, but since we’re on the topic, any brands that you default to, that you like. And that chub mackerel piece for folks, that detail is important because they’re a mackerel of many different sizes. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. King mackerel is kind of high. This is Chicken of the Sea. So if you want to do the budget, you buy the case, the more you buy and then Amazon subscription and then, it goes on sale. You can actually get it for like less than a dollar a can. And I do the same with Chicken of the Sea jack mackerel or yeah, just chub mackerel or jack mackerel. So they’re both small fish. And I kind of like the King Oscar brand too. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a little bit more pricey and Seasons brand is pretty good too, but I mean, it’s like as cheap as dog food. I mean, we buy some pretty fancy like freeze dry, we don’t buy the kibble stuff, but when you run the numbers and we buy — Tim Ferriss: It’s very inexpensive. Dominic D’Agostino: Cases of eggs for like 120 per — if you do like eggs, fish, beef and also turkey, you can get turkeys for under a dollar a pound, the whole turkey. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and just for people who are like, “Oh, my God, I can’t believe you guys are eating mackerel mixed with oil and vinegar in a dog bowl.” That’s not all you can eat. There’s more that you can eat. You can have, like, chicken with cheese on it. You can have vegetables. There are certain things you have to watch out for, so you’re not whacking yourself out of ketosis. But in my particular case, I don’t mind — and the fact of the matter is when I wrote The 4-Hour Body, people were like, “Oh, my God, you want us to repeat the same meals over and over again?” I’m like, “What did you have for breakfast the last five days?” And they ate the same thing. You’re just swapping out to fall meals. So my first meal is something typically pretty small, like the macro I explained, and then I have a big meal. I might have some more protein in between, but it’s like yesterday I had lamb chops that were delicious with some vegetables made in an air fryer, no problem. And later on, I might have a rib eye on a big — chopped up on a big gigantic salad with some other stuff added to it. But that’s about it. You have to be careful with the macadamia nuts. Those things will creep up on you. But that is in effect the diet, right? And I’m doing my training, I’m doing my rehab, I’m doing my zone two. I do find them a little, let’s say lower performance when I’m in ketosis, but what I wanted to talk about is maybe a false negative that I’ve experienced and I’ll explain what that is. So how do you know if you’re — and I keep putting this in quotation marks like quote unquote in ketosis, right? Because most people are, or maybe all people are producing some level of ketones. So there are different concentrations that you can measure with a finger prick just like you would look at glucose. And at least with the finger prick, I think that’s measuring what you mentioned earlier as being so beneficial in a lot of studies, the beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB. I also have — because I wanted to run this tracking, a G7 Dexcom continuous glucose monitor on one arm and then a SiBio. Apologies if I’m not pronouncing that correctly, continuous ketone monitor on the other arm, and I’m wearing an Oura ring when I sleep to see how all of this affects my sleep architecture and everything else. So I’m gathering all of this, but then I noticed something really weird, which I’ve texted you about because I keep feeling like I’m failing at keto. I feel great. I feel sharp. And yet when I look at not just the continuous glucose monitor, but even with the finger prick, because you do have to often calibrate these things, right? Don’t assume that your continuous monitors are accurate. You want to calibrate them. But I’m looking at the numbers. And for instance, my girlfriend freaked out the other night because my phone started screaming. I had earplugs in because I didn’t hear it. And it was critical medical alert or whatever the code red was because my glucose was 69, I suppose. It’s gotten quite a bit lower on ketosis, but usually hovers somewhere between 65 and 80. And my ketones were 0.2 millimolars. Now, when we’ve talked in prior conversations about what kind of target you might aim for, it seems like between 1.2 and two millimolars is anxiolytic, lowers anxiety and then you’re looking for this ratio. You could talk about this, but the GKI, there’s a ratio of glucose to ketones. And I look at those numbers and I’m like, “This makes no sense to me because I’m not getting enough glucose to function well. And if I’m basing it off of the Keto-Mojo finger prick, even the Precision Xtra from Abbott or my continuous ketone monitor, I’m not getting any ketones either if you’re taking it at face value. So how am I functioning? How would you answer that? Because I don’t think I’d be the only person who feels like they’re doing something wrong if they run into this, but how would you interpret this? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I would definitely say you’re running lean. And I think what you’ve done in your OGTT test is really good. I think you had messaged that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and the OGTT for folks is just that oral glucose tolerance test where you drink a bunch of dextrose water and then they take your blood every 30 minutes for two hours to see how you’re responding to it. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. The biggest metabolic lever would be you have enhanced insulin sensitivity. And I think that has been the focus. For example, Ben Bikman wrote a book on this and doing hundreds of podcasts on insulin resistance, reversing insulin resistance and low carb ketogenic being effective for that. So that, first and foremost, your insulin sensitivity is very high. Your fat oxidation is really high and your glucose disposal is high. And if you’re in a caloric deficit, your ketone uptake is very high. We see this quite convincingly. In older rats where we gavage, where we tube feed the rats and they’re older, the ketones get to toxic levels. Whereas a younger metabolically fit rodent will dispose of it very quickly. Same with a couch potato human, same with an elite level athlete. So you have very rapid — So when you measure ketones in the blood, that’s a function of ketone production and ketone utilization. And you could have two to five times higher ketone utilization with high metabolic fitness. And that’s due in part to ketolytic enzymes, you up-regulate the MCT transporters, that could be two, or in rodents, two or three times higher. I haven’t done that personally and we have some data in humans we haven’t published yet, but that is a real thing and I think that you’re experiencing. Also, if you’re in a caloric deficit, there’s less spillover. I just bought an antique motorcycle and it’s got a carburetor and the float sticks a little bit and it always drips out the carburetor when I’m running it. And when I stop and it’s pouring out the carburetor. So there’s spillover of fuel, right? But when I’m running it’s running lean because I’m using the fuel that’s going to the carburetor. And the same analogy here is that if, for example, it might be good to just sit in one spot and relax and maybe eat a little bit of surplus calories or even eat a little bit of carbs. And what you’ll see often is your ketones spike up. So I remember some of my highest ketone levels ever is when I consumed carbohydrates after I was fasting or in a state of ketone. It jumped up to five, six, seven, and I was like, “What is going on here?” But the glucose in that context is ketone sparing, but the glucose will also shut off ketogenesis so it’ll tank afterwards. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, afterwards. Yeah, okay. So it sounds like then because of probably the intermittent fasting in large part, I would think, if my insulin sensitivity is high enough, that can be paired with higher ketone utilization. So if on the assembly line of my body, right, they’re producing 10 units of ketones. If I didn’t have good ketone utilization and it was my first rodeo with ketosis, let’s just say, or a ketogenic diet, the finger prick might pick up all 10 of those units. I’m simplifying here, right? But if I have high ketone utilization and my body’s quickly using eight of those, especially in a caloric deficit, then it’s only measuring two and I’m getting the false negative that I’m not actually producing ketones in the first place. Is that a fair, very, very simplified description? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. And you’re not measuring tissue levels of ketones, which we have done too, even in the brain, and that can shoot up really high. So that’s also, and I’ve done this with Peter Attia too, we were measuring blood and then breath, and it seems like when we were in a caloric deficit fasting, our ketones were really low in the blood. Low is one to two, but we were really deep into fasting, whereas our breath ketones were maxing out the meters. So the breath ketones in this — we concluded that after a lot of testing that the breath ketones were almost a better indicator of ketosis, a more accurate, I guess you could say, in a caloric deficit. Because when you’re in a caloric deficit, you just have very high ketone disposal uptake into the tissues. Tim Ferriss: It looks like a breathalyzer, right? So is that measuring, what is it, acetoacetate? No, I’m just trying to repeat words that I’ve heard once or twice, but it’s not BHB. Dominic D’Agostino: Acetone. Tim Ferriss: Acetone. God dammit. All right. I know I was close. It was a 50/50. Dominic D’Agostino: It comes from the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. We’ll spit out about 20 percent of the acetoacetate will kick off to acetone and then you can measure it. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Dominic D’Agostino: We’ve measured blood levels of each, and it’s very tricky to do that, but we’ve done it in the lab. Tim Ferriss: All right. Here’s another practical, tactical question for you because I’ve gone back and forth on this and Uncle ChatGPT has confused the shit out of me so maybe you can help resolve it. Gluconeogenesis and protein intake, right? So you consume, what is it, between 240 grams of protein a day, something like that? Is that roughly? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, on active days. On less active days, if I’m just behind my computer all day, maybe closer to 180, 200, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: And people might have picked up when Dom was casually throwing around like, “When you’ve been squatting 400 and you take a break and then you go back and you only can squat 300 pounds.” Dom’s a pretty big guy who’s also deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps before, after fasting for a week. So he and I are not the same size, but nonetheless, I’m trying to figure out on one hand how much protein I can eat without my liver taking excess protein amino acids and turning it into glucose, right? And depending on what I look at, and I have looked at sources outside of ChatGPT, on one hand, there are folks who say, “Don’t worry about it. If you’re consuming enough fat, you really don’t have to worry about it.” And then there are other folks who are like, “Watch out, watch out. If you consume more than X number of grams at a given meal, you can very easily knock yourself out of ketosis,” which would, if that’s true, be maybe an alternate explanation for why I’m getting these low readings, if I’m having a small meal around 3:00 and then a gigantic meal later on. How should I and how should listeners think about this? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So if you were to consume protein in the form of liquid, for example, like whey or something like that, then the rapid entry of amino acids into your bloodstream from your small intestine will shut off ketosis. So fat and fiber and salt, because your pyloric sphincter will basically be pretty tight until your — Tim Ferriss: Talking dirty, Dom. Dominic D’Agostino: Pyloric sphincter is where your stomach connects to your small intestine, if you have a very fatty, salty, high fiber meal, that entryway, we call that the sphincter, it’s the pyloric sphincter, will remain shut until the contents of your stomach become isotonic. Which means that your body has to give up water and it’s got to churn it and break it down. So you could delay gastric absorption simply with fat, fiber, and salt is pretty good too. You could do ketone salts or just salt electrolytes. So that will delay the entry of amino acids or protein into the small intestine and thus amino acids into the bloodstream. And that’s the major regulator of ketosis having an impact on insulin and also having impact on gluconeogenesis to that rate of entry. And if you can slow that down, you see nothing on the CGM and your ketosis levels can basically stay. You could further augment that by using MCT oil with the protein and the fiber. And so if you have long chain fats from a fatty steak and MCT oil and then fiber. And that could be insoluble fiber is pretty good to soluble and insoluble, that can slow the entry of amino acids and essentially buffer the gluconeogenic response. Tim Ferriss: So let’s say I was stuck in San Francisco late. I’m just taking a rare trip over here, which is a pretty exciting time to be here with all of the mania with AI going on. But I mean, everyone’s kind of drunk on the Kool-Aid, but that’s a separate story. I got trapped downtown because didn’t want to deal with traffic and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I ended up having a huge bunless double cheeseburger. Gigantic, this thing, I did not expect it to be as big as it was, right? And so I go online to try to figure out what the protein content of this thing might be. And it’s 80 grams of protein, right? But plenty of fat, certainly. Tons of fat, salty AF, plenty of salt, right? Not a lot of fiber, we’ll give that one a pass. Should I be worried about something like that knocking me out of ketosis? Dominic D’Agostino: I think you need to measure. So I’m default back to everybody’s a unique metabolic entity, but if you eat that and your activity level is high and you’re in a bit of a caloric deficit and you were to have that and not overdo it on the total calories. I know my body. I know my body, I could stay in ketosis, but if you have that oversatiated feeling — so we have neurons, we have neuronal pathways to and from the liver and to and from the gut. We call that afferent and efferent signaling in the enteric nervous system. And a big meal will basically tell your brain that you had a big meal. And independent, I talked about the amino acids going into the bloodstream kicking you out of ketosis. But there’s also this, when you have stretch receptors and you have the big full meal in your gut, then that could actually tell your brain to activate the sympathetic nervous system. And then that, by virtue of spilling out catecholamines can basically, we’re talking adrenaline, epinephrine, things like that, that can further augment and enhance gluconeogenesis. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Let me just translate that for a second. So people wake up. Cortisol has developed this bad reputation among a lot of online influencers, but you really need cortisol, right? So when you wake up in the morning and you see a bit of a glucose spike, it’s actually important to get your ass up and moving. If you’re in ketosis, it’s a different thing, right? So if I’m hearing you correctly, outside of how people think about digestion, blood sugar, insulin, et cetera, that just based on stretching your stomach, et cetera, with these mechanoreceptors, taking the inputs, that that signals to the brain, it’s go time. So let’s basically get things moving with these hormones and that could in and of itself then trigger the liver to produce more glucose or liberate more glycogen, I guess. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. It can. It’s above and beyond what you normally eat. If you train your body to that size meal, but it also activates other gut hormones like cholecystokinin, that’s called CCK, and other things that can then activate the parasympathetic nervous system that comes in a little bit after. At the same time, it bifurcates, but then the parasympathetic nervous system is relax, digest, rest and relax, digest. So that comes in after. So you might see a blip and make you feel stimulated. Also, all the salt, if it’s a salty meal, it’s going to expand your plasma volume. Your blood volume will increase and that can increase your blood pressure a little bit and that can activate your sympathetic nervous system. So it’s always good to go take a walk after a big meal. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I do that. Dominic D’Agostino: Not like a strenuous — not like go squat and deadlift, but just yeah. Even a 10, 15, ideally a 20-minute brisk walk is really good after a big meal. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Now let me ask you this on the walk timing. So when I have a big meal, and I will say, I think I have trained my body to have big meals. What the exact response is, I can only give you subjectively what I feel and I can give you what the monitors show, right? But I typically feel pretty good. However, if I have a big meal, whether this is in ketosis or otherwise, I don’t see the biggest spike until something like, depends on the meal, right? But 60 to 90 minutes later, that’s when I see the spike. So should I do the walk at 60 to 90 minutes, or should I do the walk right after the meal? When should I actually time the walk? Dominic D’Agostino: So you eat a meal, you go walk, and then you see the rise 60 to 90 minutes after, or is that independent of the walk? Tim Ferriss: Independent of the walk. Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. So you’re not walking, but you see the rise 60 to 90 minutes later. So I’m saying that you might not see that rise 60 or 90 minutes later because — Tim Ferriss: If you did it right after the meal? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, just because a little bit goes a long way. So just like walking, actually doing some stretching and walking too, it activates the glucose four, the GLUT4 transporters. So that’s an insulin independent. So less insulin is dumped, greater glucose uptake. And you’re also using the sympathetic nervous system mobilization of glucose through gluconeogenesis during that walk. So it then attenuates the buffering of ketogenesis, and a very short walk can go a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, cool. Is it GLUT4? GLUT4? How do you pronounce that? I don’t know. How do people say that? Dominic D’Agostino: I say GLUT. I say GLUT4. Tim Ferriss: Okay. All right, GLUT4. Dominic D’Agostino: People say GLUT. Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. For the OGs in the audience, go back and look for GLUT4 in The 4-Hour Body. It’s in there. So the other measurement question I want to ask you about, which is these continuous glucose and ketone monitors are not designed for someone like me, right? They’re developed presumably, I don’t know about the keto monitor, but in the case of glucose to help people with serious conditions not end up in very serious situations, right? So when I am looking at my ketone levels, like right now I feel very sharp. I had some KetoStart, you know this well. Exogenous ketone salt-based product not too long ago, just in hot water with a little bit of MCT oil. This was, I guess, an hour, hour and a half ago, but I’m at 0.4 millimolars. And I guess what I’m saying is whether I have a huge meal or I’m fasting as I am right now, my range is basically 0.1 to 0.4 95 percent of the time. There are a few outlier cases. If I’m just doing a YOLO, as many grams as possible exogenous ketone party, then maybe I can goose it, but we can talk about this. Once it gets past a certain point, then I might spike insulin and have a subsequent crash. But I guess what I’m trying to say in brief is my range for the most part is 0.1 to 0.4, regardless of whether I’m fasting or eating a gigantic double cheeseburger. So I’m not really sure how to determine what effect it’s having. I can watch the glucose, but right now I’m 0.4 millimolars of concentration on the SciBio. And as we’ve talked about, maybe the Precision Xtra would give me an extra 0.1 or 0.2, but they’ve been pretty close so far. And then ever since my cheat meal, we had this experiment, right? I wanted to see if I did a workout and then had one or two cheat meals last Saturday. It is now Thursday, but my glucose right now is 103, right, which is higher than the week prior, but it goes around. It moves around, right? Last night it was probably 70 something. Do you have any suggestions for how to read the tea leaves or is it mostly just subjective feel? I mean, still thinking about the size of the meal, right? But I guess what I’m saying is, if my device is telling me as it is right now, 0.4, fat not burning. You’re almost not burning fat at the moment, not in ketone. It’s very chastising. So if I’m to believe this by the letter of the law on the screen, I’m failing at ketosis, right? Any thoughts on how to read the tea leaves here? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, I would ignore that. I think that’s an app in the process of being developed, the fat — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: You would need whole body metabolomics to really answer that question if you’re in fat burning or do metabolic cart and look at respiratory quotient or whatever. But subjectively, if you feel good — We have seen an athlete, especially more advanced athletes that, and we do a very strict, strict keto macros and everything that basically with a bunch of athletes with 0.8 is about as high as we get, and that’s the average across. Sometimes you get guys 2.5, 2.6 every day. And the same guy with the same essentially metabolic phenotype will be running 0.4 or 0.3. He could potentially just have greater ketone utilization. So I think it would be important to measure your blood. So a continuous ketone monitor measures interstitial — that can be different. The SciBio, I think it’s a great device. It’s very versatile. I can jump in and out of salt water. The thing stays on me. It’s almost more reliable than a CGM. But I did notice, and I’ve probably used about 50 of these devices that the first week, is pretty accurate and then it tapers off, the sensitivity. And this is a known limitation of the technology is that essentially the enzyme-based sensor system tends to just — and you could get around that conceivably just by having the ability in the app to calibrate it. So if you were to measure it and the continuous ketone monitor is measuring 1.0, but your blood ketones is 2.0 that you should be able to calibrate it like you can with a Dexcom. So they acknowledged that at the company and they said, “Yes, we realize that that would fix the problem,” but that’s not a feature of the app yet. Tim Ferriss: They do have in events, they have blood ketone on the bottom right. I just don’t know if it actually calibrates it. It may just record the blood ketone at this point. Dominic D’Agostino: It does not have the ability to calibrate it to my knowledge. Tim Ferriss: I inputted one measurement on the Keto-Mojo and it didn’t seem to change it, right? The number stayed the same. So I think it’s just logging it because you can do that with a glucometer. Dominic D’Agostino: Well, you can do it with Dexcom, but not Abbott. Tim Ferriss: Dexcom. Okay. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a problem with the Abbott FreeStyle too. And that’s the feedback I gave them because I put these devices on, it’s reading me 130, but I measure I’m like 80, literally 50. Because — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: — if you are lean and it’s stuck in your muscle instead of your adipose tissue, the glucose levels are going to be higher, especially when — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: — you work out and stuff. So I’ve noticed this and that’s for me, so that’s why the Dexcom is very nice because I can calibrate it too, and I consistently show that. And that was a major issue I had. Tim Ferriss: Let me hop in also and just tell folks this is not going to be very quantifiable, but for what it’s worth. Part of my reason I avoided intermittent fasting for so long is that I thought I would not be able to get sufficient protein or caloric intake and that I would lose a bunch of muscle mass. I was dead wrong about that. I was very, very wrong. If anything, it seems to have enhanced my ability to put on muscle per calorie or per gram of protein ingested. And so I admit I was totally wrong about that. Furthermore, on this ketogenic diet where I’ve historically found it pretty hard to put on muscle or — I mean, I shouldn’t say keep muscle because I’m only doing it for a few weeks, but I have been astonished by having one small meal. I’ll have some oxtail soup after this with some veggies and obviously oxtail. It’s a whole separate story. And then I’ll go out and have another meal probably in three or four hours, which will be a much bigger meal. And just with that, and I am watching some of the grams of protein intake and so on, but I have not, looking in the mirror and looking at the weights that I’m putting up in the gym, I don’t feel like I have lost any muscle and I feel like I have leaned out. Some of that’s losing fluid, but I’ve been really impressed with how little relative to what I used to do in college, taking weight gainers and just all this garbage, how little it actually takes to at least maintain muscle mass. But I do have a question for you, which I’ve never really been able to answer to my satisfaction, and it relates to rabbit starvation. So for people who don’t know what that is, you could probably give a better description, but if you’ve ever watched the show Alone, Alone is probably the only reality TV show that I love to watch. seasons six and seven in particular are outstanding for folks. But what you’ll notice is that if people are trying to survive in the wilderness to outlast everyone else, that’s what the show is. You get to pick a handful of items, you get dropped off, you don’t get to choose where you’re dropped, and then you just need to survive for as long as possible. Sometimes it’s 100 days, sometimes it’s last man or woman standing. If somebody is only eating lean protein like rabbits, they will waste away. They will not last. They will have to get yanked out for medical reasons, and that might seem strange to people. My question though is on a ketogenic diet specifically, can you just consume leaner protein and then rely on body fat for the fat? And some people are like, “Yeah, everybody knows that doesn’t work.” But I really want to understand why that’s the case, right? Because I understand dietary fat dampens insulin response, right? Or at least that’s my understanding. Maybe there’s a rate limiting step in how much body fat you can break down and use, right? And who knows if that’s mediated by the kidneys or who the hell, liver, I don’t know, right? I guess it would probably be liver, but I’d love to hear your take on it, right? Because certainly in the past, I and lots of people reading The 4-Hour Body have been able to lose more body fat than they are told they are capable of losing, as measured through DEXA scans and other things. Can you do a moderate fat or low fat protein-based keto diet if your goal in part is to lose body fat, or does that backfire? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, just not indefinitely. So when I did the ketogenic diet for a year, I was cruising at about 300 to 320 grams of fat, sometimes 350 grams of fat per day. And then just experimenting, I would throw in a two days per week of protein veggies with about 50 to 100 grams of fat. And in those days of dropping to 300 plus grams of fat to 50 to 100 grams of fat, after two days, I swore I lost two percent body fat and I would just transition back. So I would just periodically throw in protein veggie days. I would cruise on keto and then periodically titrate in the protein veggie days to assist body composition alterations. So if I kept that going, I could get pretty dramatic, almost scary lean to where it happened very fast. It’s almost keto trains your fat metabolism and then if you just start titrating in, it’s just pulling fat out. And I think my body really liked throwing in the veggies with the fiber seemed to help with the gut health and I would do that twice a week and it’s pretty dramatic. Tim Ferriss: Why not do it seven days a week? What happens when you try to do it for more? Dominic D’Agostino: If the idea is to stay in ketosis, it was really hard for me to stay in ketosis if I do protein veggies. After two days, I would be out, but my metabolism would be cranking. Tim Ferriss: Mechanistically, why is that the case? Why doesn’t your body just break down more body fat? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, because, well, it’s taking body fat exogenously and endogenously and I think the more fat going to the liver and the more fat that’s in circulation, it gets shuttled to the liver and then that’s stimulating beta oxidation in the liver. You just have a greater fat pool. But actually, I think, the day that I would do protein veggie days and then the day I would jump back into ketosis, I would see this big ramp up in ketones that day. Whereas if I did like a cheat day and just ate a lot of carbohydrates, it took me two or three days to get back into ketosis. But if I just did like protein and veggies and cruised back into ketosis, then I would rapidly get back into ketosis and just give my body a break from the fat. But I think just that short amount of time really stimulates mobilization of fat from your body because your body is used to getting it exogenously, and then you’re pulling more fat off. But yeah, I think on the protein veggie days, I’m getting higher amounts of calories from protein. So that has a bit of an anti-ketogenic effect. And then shifting back into ketosis on that third day, I always had probably the best ketone numbers for the week. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I don’t want to beat this dead horse too long, but I’d love to just hear you riff on this a little bit more because I guess in my mind I’m thinking, well, on your protein veggie-only days, if you’re getting enough protein, not enough protein to satisfy all of your resting metabolic rate, like you’re hypocaloric, but you’re getting enough protein to not lose muscle, why wouldn’t the body just break down the fat that it needs to continue producing ketones, right? So I’m trying to avoid the gluconeogenesis problem where you’re having like 200 grams at a meal with no fat to offset it, but if you’re having smaller amounts that are slowly digested, but it’s just enough to keep you from losing muscle mass, maybe you’re doing some weight training to help with that or whatever, then I guess what I’m trying to figure out is why the dietary fat is so important? Because I think of the body, right? It’s like each pound of stored body fat is what? Dominic D’Agostino: 3,600. Tim Ferriss: All right. So 3,600 calories, that’s a decent amount of calories, right? And for somebody who’s, let’s just say you’re 150 pounds, 10 percent body fat, okay, you got 15 times 3,600, you got plenty of body fat to go around. So it would seem to be enough to do a few weeks of ketosis that is low fat, higher protein, but not enough protein to necessarily be hammering your liver with gluconeogenesis if you’re dividing it up, slowly digested protein. Some people are going to be really annoyed with me dragging this out so long, but why is dietary fat so important? Dominic D’Agostino: Because I mean, that’s the fuel that you are using, you coax your body into using. And I should probably add a little bit of context to my protein veggie days. So I would go from like 125 grams of protein to like 300 grams of protein. Tim Ferriss: Right, right. Dominic D’Agostino: That’s a pretty big bolus of protein. Tim Ferriss: That’s a lot, yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: And if one was to go a hundred grams of protein or whatever, and then bump it up to like 170 or 200 or something, they may not kick out of ketosis. But I remember just lower ketones, but not out of — I was still in ketosis, but typically how I think I did it like my protein veggie days were following like a heavy deadlift or squat workout. So the thinking was that I’m recovering for those two days and the extra amino acids and proteins and mTOR activation is sort of assisting in recovery and regeneration and skeletal muscle protein synthesis. And then I would kind of go back. I calculated it in that way. So yeah, I like double the protein on the protein veggie days, but my calories were about the same or maybe a little bit lower. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I need a SiBio if you’re listening, please allow me to calibrate this with a finger prick because I need a little more range. I need a little more range than 0.01 to 0.04 for me to be able to read this type of thing effectively, right? Because technically, if I’m reading this as it is, I’m never in ketosis. I shouldn’t say never, that’s not true. But in any case, it would not be nice to be able to calibrate. Let’s come back to something I promised that I would ask about, which is neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer’s, et cetera. Could the ketogenic diet benefit people with these conditions? And just as important, certainly for me personally, could this, is it plausible that there’s a mechanism by which the ketogenic diet regularly done could help delay the onset of any of these diseases? Or am I just Pollyanna hoping for a pie in the sky? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I think that’s a question we don’t have an unambiguous answer to, but I think all the science points into the direction that if you improve upon and optimize your cardiometabolic — I like to say cardioimmunometabolic biomarkers, instead of cardiometabolic biomarkers because if you can lower, for example, your insulin and keep that between two to six, and if you lower your hsCRP below 0.6 and then optimize your hemoglobin A1C or glucose. And I think also, and I’ve talked about this with Rhonda Patrick and other people, too, that if you measure your omega-3 fatty acids and look at your omega-3 to 6 ratio, I think that’s going to be a biomarker that’s probably going to end up in standard blood work because it’s so compelling, the data behind it. And you also measure your B12, too. I think that’s important. People coming into the Alzheimer’s center that can present as flat-out Alzheimer’s disease and then you correct their B12, a B12 deficiency will cause brain atrophy, and that could be reverse with B12. So the things that if you’re following ketone metabolic therapy, it’s impacting the things that we know are driving age-related chronic diseases, and then obviously one of them is Alzheimer’s. So the level of inflammation, hsCRP now is probably more atherogenic than LDL. There’s probably people selling statins that don’t want to hear that, but we know that the data is emerging on that now. So lower insulin, lower inflammation — Tim Ferriss: And that’s an inflammatory marker, right? The C-reactive protein. What does the HS stand for or what is that? Dominic D’Agostino: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Tim Ferriss: High-sensitivity. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So it measures in that lower range. And I used to trend to like two to two to three, like my early CRP, hsCRP when I was like on a high carb, I only had it measured twice when I was on like a high-carb diet, but since I’ve been keto, it’s like either non-detectable or like 0.2. Or when I did extreme environment research on myself, then I could bump it up a little bit. And when I had a bacterial or viral gastroenteritis, it shot through the roof because it activated your immune system. But generally that hsCRP is a big driver. I used to laugh at it and be like, “Ah, it’s this nonsensitive thing.” But now like all the data is pointing to the direction that we need to add that to that. And your omega-3 status, your B12, make sure you don’t have any deficiencies because that could lead to sort of rapid progression to Alzheimer’s disease, your magnesium levels. But also just in general like exercise, the biggest metabolic lever and your body weight, body composition. Get DEXA scans. I know it might be good for you to do a DEXA scan with your keto experiments, too. So I was doing once a year, but now I end up doing like three or four times a year because I do these mini experiments to see how acutely some of the things are impacting my body composition because I just get antsy for like an answer to that. But it’s a long-winded explanation to just basically say that your metabolic health is tightly linked to your brain health and can dramatically delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Not that you’re going to get it or reverse it altogether before something else gets you in the end. Yep. Tim Ferriss: Well, I mean, the metabolic health piece, just to underscore that, I mean, one of my relatives in question, APOE 3/3, I understand that’s not the only risk factor, but there’s something just seemed to be missing because the decline was so precipitous. It didn’t map to any patient data or clinical data that a number of doctors, who are also researchers I was working with, had seen. Also because this person, this relative had been assessed four or five years prior and did not show any indication of predisposition to a rapid decline. And I’m APOE 3/4, again, recognizing there are other factors at play, but when she just kind of disintegrated, there are a few things that came to light. Number one is her local GP had basically missed severe metabolic dysfunction for years. And I can’t remember the reference range, but like insulin, let’s call it upper bound of 12. I’m making this up, but you’ll get the idea. And she was like 43, right? It was just absolutely atrocious. Dominic D’Agostino: And her body weight and just general composition? Tim Ferriss: I mean, poor body composition. Yeah. Poor body composition, very little exercise despite my best efforts, misbehaves horribly, dietarily, not morbidly obese, but certainly — Dominic D’Agostino: Smoking, alcohol, other drugs? Tim Ferriss: No smoking or alcohol. But here’s the other piece that, so she had been diagnosed with stage one breast cancer, had a lumpectomy, was removed, late 70s was put on an estrogen, I think it’s an estrogen blocker called letrozole. And I looked at this and I spoke to a friend of mine who was a radio-oncologist and she said it is very poorly tolerated by most women from a cognitive perspective, like they get smashed by and large. Dominic D’Agostino: Guys, too, by the way. Guys who take — Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, guys do. Dominic D’Agostino: — aromatase inhibitors, yeah, for like TRT and things like that. It’s not a good thing to do. Tim Ferriss: Yep, yeah. So I was looking at it and I mean, it’s upsetting that I’m the one who has to kind of find these things, but it’s like, okay, well, we think about the oncologist’s role. It’s to prevent my mom from dying of cancer. That’s the directive, right? But if she were 30 and had later stage cancer that was really aggressive, it’s one thing, but she’s late 70s, stage one, all cancer removed, and so got her off of the letrozole with the cooperation and after discussions with doctors and almost saw an immediate turnaround within a handful of weeks after the washout period and everything. But it seems to, I mean, look, I’m not an MD. I don’t play one on the internet, but it seems to have done some real damage. I mean, there’s the metabolic piece that is very non-trivial, but the acceleration of decline was just so absurd over the course of a handful of months, terrifying to see. But I guess I’m laying this all in, not necessarily to explore this particular case because I’ve got a lot of people on it for all of my relatives, but it’s just to say that my — like I am not going quietly into the night with something like Alzheimer’s, right? And so what I’m trying to figure out for myself, I’d be curious to hear your perspective. I will be honest, I find keto pretty goddamn boring. I don’t find it to be the most diverse diet in the world. I don’t really want to do it all year round. I also have some maybe compromising cardiac elements. I’m a cholesterol hyper-absorber, so I do use — again, guys, talk to your doc. Don’t just copy me, but it’s like I’m using Repatha, taking ezetimibe. I have been also taking Nexlizet, but that might end up being redundant, the bempedoic acid with the Repatha. That is a long way of saying I’ve got to keep an eye on the heart stuff because neurodegenerative disease and cardiovascular disease is what kills everybody in my family. So for a lot of reasons, I don’t want to do keto all year, but I’m trying to figure out what is the sort of minimal effective dose that — and I know we’re going to have to probably take a couple of speculative leaps here, but just as a working hypothesis, what does a minimum effective dose of following a strict ketogenic diet look like for me? Assuming the rest of the time I’m still doing intermittent fasting, I’m not eating a lot of refined carbohydrates, but how might you suggest that I think about that? Because I don’t know what the durability of kind of keto memory, like metabolic memory is. So I’m trying to figure out like can I get away with two, three to four-week periods a year where there’s some carryover of like cancer-protective — our last conversation we kind of talked about thinking about ketones as hormones, but in terms of neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, yada, yada, yada, what are your thoughts? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, I think in your context it’s hard to say, like to give absolutes, but I would say you can get 80 percent of the benefits with a low-carb diet. Low-carb meaning 100 grams a day, just fibrous, non-starch, non-sugar carbs, low-carb Mediterranean, if you want to call it that. And then periodically, maybe one week out of a month, get into a deeper state of ketosis and at higher is not better. We know that from the research. When ketones get into that two, three, four, five millimolar range, that creates energy toxicity and something we call reductive stress, and that is not good. I did not know this before getting into this kind of research, but the sweet spot seems to be between one and two for therapeutic ketosis, unless you’re metabolically managing a disorder that’s highly responsive to a ketogenic diet like neurometabolic diseases. And some of the things that we actually study need to be in the two to three millimolar. And oxygen toxicity needs to be like four to five because it’s a — very powerful seizures. But one to two seems to be the sweet spots for metabolic management of many different things and also just general metabolic health. And I think what you’d be doing, just doing low-carb and periodic ketosis is just enhancing your metabolic flexibility and maybe increasing the diversity of food that you’re eating to prevent micronutrient deficiencies, too. I am of the opinion that plants are good for you to eat broccoli, asparagus, salads, colorful vegetables, things like that, that kind of fit into a pattern of eating that we’ve known. Even things like lentils are probably good. Lentils actually have like zero CGM response to me, but I — Tim Ferriss: Really? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, lentils seems to like, skyrocket other people that I know. I’m like completely flat. Tim Ferriss: I’m like somewhere in between. Yeah, I’m somewhere in between. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. Like completely flat. I don’t know. Maybe it’s the time of day that I have them at dinner, then I always go take a walk, but it’s like no bump at all in my CGM. And I think that’s where CGM comes into play and we can do a personal precision engineered diet, if you will, and it gives us insight into the types of foods and the amount of foods that we can eat. And I think that’s going to be really important information. And I know there’s a lot of people harping on, because another study came out on CGMs provide no benefit at all to the non-diabetic. And I’ve had this conversation with people actually at a big event and people that were type 2 diabetics and I asked them just flat-out, I just went around the table and just saying, “If you’re type 2 diabetic, when you were diagnosed like three years ago, if you were to be giving a CGM five years before that, or even one year before that, do you think you would’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes?” And they said no. They said once they got type 2 diabetes and got a CGM, it gave them the awareness. I mean, you can ask anyone who has flat-out over type 2 diabetes and just ask them the question, “Hey, if you were given a CGM a year or two in advance and you understood the impact of foods.” So I think a CGM is going to be important for delaying that Alzheimer’s disease. And if you have loved ones, Tim and your family, that I think you would encourage them to slap on a CGM and get some insight into what they’re eating. But it’s also forcing them to exercise because we’re talking about diet here, but just getting out and doing a brisk walk 20, 30 minutes a day can go a long way. Resistance exercise, I’m a little biased towards that, but muscle is like an endocrine organ that produces hormones and various molecules that are neuroprotective and muscle is tightly linked to brain size and, of course, your waist and your visceral fat. I would also encourage them to get a DEXA scan and gamify it and say, every year I’m going to get a DEXA scan and every year like I do, I just kind of create a lot of stress for myself to beat my DEXA scan every year and get their friends involved, make it like a social event. Everybody goes and gets their DEXA and then every year you go back and just try to beat your scores. But I mean, these are low-hanging fruit kind of things people should be doing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Let me, I think probably fair to say, make sure you consistently hydrate for any of these things like a DEXA scan. I do have a follow-up question. So also on the exercise piece, people can look up something called klotho, K-L-O-T-H-O. There’s a lot more that comes of exercise like BDNF and all these various things. There’s a book called Spark that covers some of it, but it’s very outdated, but check out klotho. There are a lot of good reasons to exercise. Thinking of muscle like an endocrine organ, that’s a really good way to put it. My question to you was, you mentioned, say, one week per month going to more of a lower carb or ketotic state. How would you think about the benefits of one week per month? Assuming that the rest of the time I’m behaving, most of the time with a lower carbohydrate Mediterranean diet, let’s just say, okay, one week per month, every three months or three weeks, like contiguous weeks once a quarter. Do you feel like one of those is superior to the other? Dominic D’Agostino: Not really. I think whatever pattern works best, I think you would gain benefits for both. That would be an interesting experiment to do. Tim Ferriss: I’m just thinking about the lead time to get into a properly ketogenic state. If I’m going from some carbohydrate to ketosis, I’m just — we could talk about things that might accelerate it, but if it takes me two days to get there or three days and then I only have kind of four days in the sweet spot, these are things running through my mind. I’m just curious to get your take. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. The one-week intervention for the month, my kind of opinion is that it could be pretty aggressive. Like you cut calories 50 percent the first two days and then cruise into it, so you’re really cranking ketones by the end of the week. And then you’re also cruising into it from what should be like a low-carb diet. So you should have that metabolic flexibility to kind of seamlessly transition into that ketosis state. And you could do intermittent fasting with mild caloric restriction for the first two days to ramp up ketones. Alternatively, if your schedule permits and like your work schedule, you have like three weeks where you need to really dig deep into a research project or something and ketosis seems to give you that cognitive flow or boost, then that might situationally fit into your schedule. And I definitely have periods of time where I do that, especially like if my wife is traveling or something like that, or on a research project or something, I just like, okay, I clean the house of certain foods and then I just prepare. I mean, simple things like that, too, I know just from the clinical ketogenic world is that if you have a family member that stocks the shelves with certain foods that can trigger and cause food noise, then that could really hamper your compliance to that. But you want to prepare the house, or if you’re going into a one week or you’re going into a three week, prepare the house and just make sure that you could do. Of course, you could just call Uber Eats and get anything delivered, but you want to kind of have the house prepared for that and mentally prepare for it. Tim Ferriss: So for you, personally, if you had some hereditary gnarliness, if you look back at your family tree and you’re like, ooh, whether it’s a bunch of cancer or a bunch of neurodegenerative stuff, maybe bit of both, who knows, would you be more inclined to do the one week per month, just for you personally or yeah, one week per month? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. And I would shoot to get a glucose ketone index of like one to two for at least three days out of that week. So really do a fairly aggressive ketone metabolic therapy intervention, kind of even think about it as like a prescription intervention, just like Valter Longo’s diet is a prescription medical therapy, right? So I would shoot to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two for three days. And everything that we’ve seen in the lab that I’ve seen sort of on paper, of course, people aren’t out there measuring the autophagosome like P62 and other things, but that you are achieving a level of autophagy and that’s also stimulating many of the benefits of ketosis, not just ketones as an energy source, but you’re getting many of the robust signaling effects and really adapting your metabolism to fat and ketone sort of oxidation that has long-term benefits that can go at least three weeks. So I’m convinced of that. So you get benefits for three weeks, reset one week, benefits for three weeks, reset one week so you’re always kind of getting — whereas if you do three weeks and then take a period of time off, I’m not totally convinced that those benefits are going to span that amount of timeframe. That’s my thinking. Tim Ferriss: And you mentioned people can find calculators out there and actually a lot of the devices will try to provide this to you. Actually, is that true? I guess they would have to have both data streams, so probably not, but the GKI. So the glucose ketone index, you can find calculators for this, but fact-check this, since this is AI overview from Google, I wanted to just take a look at it. Divide your blood glucose level by your ketone level. If your glucose is milligrams per deciliter, common in the US, you first divide it by 18, this is an important step, to convert it to millimolars per liter, matching the ketone units, then perform the division. So you can figure this out very easily. And that is the GKI that you were mentioning of a one to two. What might that look like just offhand? I’m very not known for my quick mental arithmetic on the podcast, but what would a GKI of, say, one or two look like in terms of the readout on the glucose, on the glucometer and the readout on the finger prick for the millimolars for ketones? What would be an example? Dominic D’Agostino: If people are like don’t want to do the millimolar concentration of glucose, if your glucose is 80 and then your ketones are two millimolar, that would be, you are right into that one to two kind of the glucose ketone index of one to two, you’ll be between that level. If you could bring your glucose down to like 18, so like 68, 70 and get your ketones up to three, so that would be a GKI of one. So that’s pretty hard to achieve, but relatively definitely doable with exogenous ketones and MCT and things like that. I think what’s totally feasible is getting your glucose down to like 80, 80 to 85 in that range and getting your ketones at the end of the one-week fast up to two and maintaining that. So that would be kind of achieving that GKI of two. Tim Ferriss: I think I’m probably saying what I wish to be true, which is that my insulin sensitivity has improved a lot in the last certainly year in particular, and that is to explain in part, or maybe wholly, the lower readout on the ketone meters. But part of the reason I have confidence in that is that I’m using the same devices that I used to use. And back in the day, I would have much higher millimolar readouts. Of course, I have new strips. I did, at least to the extent that I can, for the continuous monitors, I’ve done calibration for the CGM at least, the glucose monitor, but that presents a problem. Even if that is, “Good news, Tim Ferriss, you’re not failing at keto. You’ve actually just made yourself a lot healthier with intermittent fasting and other things,” it still presents a problem for me to figure out if I am in that GKI sweet spot. So how would you suggest I try to figure that out? Is there a way to measure my ketone uptake and, therefore, modify the equation such that I factor that in somehow? Like there’s a multiplier of the readout on the finger prick or something like that? How would you handle that? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Let me look real quick. Tim Ferriss: Dom is looking into his Santa’s workshop of various metabolic devices. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So I have a lot of different devices. So one is the Keto-Mojo device here. Tim Ferriss: Yep, that’s the one I have. Yeah, I’ve got the Keto-Mojo. Dominic D’Agostino: Okay. So that, I mean, you could just calibrate it such that it reads in millimolar concentration in glucose and ketones, and it actually gives you, this is the GKI version. It’ll just spit out the GKI. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you know what? I do have the GKI because you’re right, the Keto-Mojo also measures glucose. I guess what I’m asking for myself is since my readouts are so low, presumably as a placeholder due to improved insulin sensitivity and ketone utilization, I’m going to fail if I’m just using the glucose and the ketone strips for the Keto-Mojo. Because right now, if it’s telling me that I’m at 0.4 millimolars, and I can tell you subjectively, I do not feel like I’m at 0.4. I feel like I’ve got a lot more juice and a lot more gas in the tank. Is there a way to, whether it’s on paper or otherwise, account for the increased ketone utilization? I mean, it’d be great for me just to verify that somehow, but then whether I can verify it or not, if I wanted to try to determine during that week, like if I’m hitting my target GKI, how would you suggest that someone like me do that if I’m just not getting the numbers necessary to make the regular math work? Dominic D’Agostino: So one to two is a high bar, I guess, a GKI of one to two. And I think we’ve had this conversation back and forth with this group that we’re working with in the cancer community. The Society for Integrative Metabolic Oncology is a group that we’re discussing the GKI, and Thomas Seyfried is very adamant about, like, getting to one to two. But I give pushback and say one to four is if you look at the published literature, one to four is absolutely 100 percent therapeutic across not only cancer, but also like seizures and everything. So I’m going to expand that range to a one to four. So what does that mean? That would mean that your glucose level can be upwards of 80. And so you could have a glucose level of 75 to 80, and then get your ketone levels to one, and that would be a GKI of one essentially if you don’t have the glucose calibration for that. Or that would be a GKI of four, rather. And it would be really rare, if not impossible, for anyone in the general population eating to even achieve a GKI of like 5 to 10. So that’s indicative of high fat oxidation, ketone production, and I think that you’re getting a lot of therapeutic benefits. Also, a millimolar concentration of one in your blood represents a 10 percent available energy for your brain. And also the Keto-Mojo devices measuring D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. And if you’re doing supplementation with racemic D and L, then you’re not picking up the L. So that could be a factor too if you’re using racemic ketone salts. And there’s a number of publications that have already happened and some in the pipeline basically showing that elevate hydroxybutyrate takes about 4 to 5 times longer to metabolize. So that’s in circulation more. And also like, if you’re on a ketogenic diet for reasons we don’t fully understand and we are to rip out the heart, about 34 to 40 percent of the ketone in the heart is elevate hydroxybutyrate. And we don’t know why it converts the D to the L, but it serves a function that — the groups that have done the research are convinced it’s not an energetic, but it’s actually impacting cardiac output and reducing peripheral vascular resistance, maybe at the glycocalyx. So I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole. But basically, it’s like if your heart is pumping against pressure and think of it as like a garden hose and you take the kink out of the garden hose, the elevate hydroxybutyrate is taking the kink out of the garden hose of your vascular endothelium and then that’s also in your brain. So you have better blood flow to your brain. I mean, there’s tons of data out there showing an increase in brain blood flow with beta-hydroxybutyrate and the L trends better to increasing that blood flow. We do a Doppler blood flow measurement on various wound healing things that we’ve done in the lab. I mean, a lot of people have vascular dementia, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep. Dominic D’Agostino: So there’s different types of dementia, and it might be not like completely one or the other. And the metabolic phenotype of dementia could be vascular. You get a restriction of oxygen and energy to the brain. My point is that one millimolar of beta-hydroxybutyrate in circulation has an energetic effect and it also has a pronounced effect on the vascular endothelium to increase blood flow and circulation. So you are getting a benefit. Tim Ferriss: I’ve never had this experience in ketosis before where these levels have been this low. It’s so bizarre. And yet, let’s say, back in the day before the intermittent fasting, and it’s pretty much the lever that I pulled that I think changed things. Prior to that, I could tell you probably within 60 minutes of hitting 0.7 millimolars on the precision extra. Like I knew when my brain clicked past that point. And I did years and years and years of this stuff. I think as much as I like to measure things, I should just assume, right? If I’m having a bowl of mackerel dog food with MCT oil and apple cider vinegar and salt and pepper, then having a meal later that effectively has close to zero carbohydrates, if I’m doing that for almost three weeks, there doesn’t seem to be a physiological option C for failure, right? It’s like, what’s my body going to do? It has to be doing something because I’m not getting the dietary carbohydrate, and I’m not just mainlining whey protein isolate all day. So, I think I’ll probably just have to trust in the process because if I do have the increased ketone utilization and I’m just somewhere between 0.2 and 0.4 millimolars, for the most point, or for the most part, I just don’t think that the math might be really hard even to hit the GKI of four. But it’s like, if you’re following the process, I guess you’re following the process, right? Dominic D’Agostino: I say trust the process and also think about — I’m talking about like blood biomarkers, but let’s talk about physical metrics that could be considered biomarkers, right? So for me, it’s all about the numbers. Like my lab books and stuff like that have numbers in the lab, but also training. It’s like, I know exactly what I’m going to do going into the next workout and it’s all about X amount of weight for X amount of reps. So you can also do that with various brain training apps where you can do reaction time. So for our NASA NEEMO experiments where we’re in an extreme environment and we’re working with astronauts, we’re assessing reaction time, decision making, risk taking, where like this balloon blows up and you don’t know when it’s going to blow up, but you have to stop. It’s like a weird risk game. So we have this whole metric of testing cognitive function, reaction time and things like that. So there are things that you could do even with an app-based thing to assess that, and I think that would be a good thing. We have a massive NIH grant at University of South Florida on brain training games and assessing performance on that. Alzheimer’s was in my family, I would basically be doing everything possible, physical training, dietary metabolic training with nutrition, supplementation, and also brain training. And brain training games, and we use Joggle, the NIH Toolbox, I mean, we have like about six or eight different types of tests that we do to get a very objective measure of cognitive function. And I think it would be good to establish that now and then get your baseline just like we’re doing a DEXA for body composition, and then test that every six months. And then do it in the absence and presence of being in ketosis. So I would suggest something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I have time blocked out in my calendar this Friday to do a whole battery of cognitive testing. And again, this is not super precise, but having tracked myself for so long and developed a water fuel for certain types of performance, zone two feels a lot easier right now, a lot easier than usual. And coming back to your prior comments. And then, I would say, I’m using software right now. At some point I’ll be able to talk more about this, but to basically train my visual processing to compensate for presbyopia, it is crazy, some of the effects that this stuff has. But it also is very much indirectly a measure of reaction speed, and they see some really cool carryover effects. And my speed in terms of time to completion for four bouts, like modules of tasks has just gone up and up and up since I’ve sort of been in extended ketosis. Again, that’s very easy for me to see. So folks who are listening, I’ll have more to share on that later, but it’s pretty mind-blowing stuff. So Dom, a few things have come up that I would love to chat about because I get these questions all the time, which relate to exogenous ketones. And people have heard this term, exogenous, endogenous. It’s very fancy talk and a tuxedo for outside the body, in the body, right? I’m simplifying here, but the easy way to remember exogenous is exoskeleton, right? It’s like a skeleton on the outside of your body. Exogenous ketones, ketones that you’re taking from outside and putting inside. People always ask, and I know you have a dog in the fight here, so I want to recognize that too. But how should people think about supplemental ketones? And are there any warnings or disclaimers that you want to add to that, right? Because this is a topic du jour. I think there’s probably no biological free lunch if people are going to be mainlining fruity pebbles and eating tons of carbohydrates, maybe not a great idea to eat tons of exogenous ketones. I don’t know, I’d be curious to get your take on that. But what’s the good, the bad, and the ugly of exogenous ketones? Where should people go? How should they think about it? Dominic D’Agostino: The things to consider would be when you’re thinking about a ketone supplement to think about palatability. If it doesn’t taste okay, you’re not going to consume it. I would, but most people won’t. Palatability, tolerability, if it gives you disaster pants or it makes you nauseous or something. So palatability, tolerability, and then the next one, the third one would be the pharmacokinetics. So you want something that when you consume it, that it has an ideal pharmacokinetics, meaning it’s not going to spike up in 30 minutes and be out of your system in like an hour or two. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Pharmacokinetics is like the stock chart for something you put in your body, right? In this case, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. And that’s important because if you have a very rapid rate of rise of ketones, that can trigger an insulin response. And what I’ve observed, if I’m cruising in ketosis and I take a large dose of a ketone ester, it shoots my ketones up real high and it’s back down within like two hours, but it also kicks out insulin and that shuts off my own ketone production. Then I’m hypoketotic and hypoglycemic from the insulin. And that can create an energy deficit in the brain. Tim Ferriss: How long does that last for you? Dominic D’Agostino: And it lasts in the context of consuming, for example, a ketone ester by itself. But if you consume the ketone ester with MCT, if you could tolerate that, you could buffer that response to some extent, or you take it with food or something, or you could avert that by different ketone formulations and we could talk about that. But I just want to move down, so you got palatability, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties, and you also have toxicity. So that would be the four things that you need to consider when sort of selecting an exogenous ketone. And those things differ depending upon if you’re using it acutely, like in a medical situation, or it’s like a daily thing that you want to take every day for prevention, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s talk about toxicity first. Dominic D’Agostino: Toxicity is probably the most important too. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Let’s, for the time being, not talk about the acute medical delivery. Let’s talk about recreational/better said layperson use, right? This is as a dietary supplement. So could you speak to the toxicity piece? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, what we observed about 10 years ago was that formulations that contained 1,3-Butanediol, that includes an ester. I have a lot of patents on and I have actually ongoing experiments with 1,3-Butanediol by itself is a ketogenic agent and that can have toxicity when used chronically. 1,3-Butanediol is an alcohol dimer and it gets metabolized through alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Aldehyde dehydrogenase kicks out a beta-hydroxybutyrate aldehyde that can be toxic. Tim Ferriss: How is it toxic? What are its toxic effects? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So alcohol dehydrogenase uses NAD, consumes NAD as its function, right? So it can basically deplete the liver of NAD. And aldehyde dehydrogenase also consumes up NAD and it rapidly depletes, for example, the liver, the hepatocytes of ATP. So we know that there’s a paper coming out that’ll show that in our lab we’ve seen therapeutic effects in certain contexts, but when delivered acutely. But when consumed chronically, when we go beyond our experimental window and give these things chronically as like a lifestyle, exogenous ketone. And then we sacrifice the animals and then we do blood work and we look at the liver, we see signs that are scary, right? And this could be inflammation in the liver, TNF-α, sinusoidal dilation, sort of like gaps in the liver, fatty liver, a number of different things start to surface. And that’s pretty much just due to metabolizing something that’s considered a toxin to the body, 1,3-Butanediol. It’s a very versatile drug. 1,3-Butanediol by itself is more toxic than 1,3-Butanediol based ketone esters. So you have the ketone monoester, which is technically the millimolar concentration. You have 51 percent of a ketone monoester is 1,3-Butanediol. So it hydrolyzed in the liver, gets into circulation. Still over 50 percent of that is 1,3-Butanediol. That kind of needs to be detoxified, but 1,3-Butanediol does get broken down to beta-hydroxybutyrate. The diester is about 35 percent 1,3-Butanediol. So, I see these as potentially problematic. Tim Ferriss: The diester is what percentage? Dominic D’Agostino: A ketone diester, which would be 11,3-Butanediol with two ketones on it. We use acetyl acetate on each, that’s 35 percent of that molecule is 1,3-Butanediol in circulation. Tim Ferriss: I got it. Dominic D’Agostino: And then the beta-hydroxybutyrate monoester is 51 percent 1,3-Butanediol in circulation. So this can become problematic when it’s used as like a supplement and a lifestyle thing like day in and day out. Tim Ferriss: Can you translate from the animal models to humans, do you think, right? Because we all know, humans are not just big furry mice, right? Do you think it translates, right? And this might be just like a precautionary measure where it’s like, “Well…” Like pending additional studies, let’s hit pause in a sense. But if it were to translate, do you have any idea what type of dosing per day or per week with which we might see this toxicity in humans, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. So there is a paucity of data, and there’s a deficiency of data on the use of these agents 1,3-Butanediol that are long-term studies. The only study that I’m aware of is a case report with Dr. Mary Newport’s husband, Steve, and then there’s a 28-day study that used 25 grams. Tim Ferriss: 25 grams. Dominic D’Agostino: 25 grams per day, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, shit. Dominic D’Agostino: And that produces like 0.1 to 1 millimolar. But what I have done is I took the R-1,3-Butanediol and then the racemic 1,3-Butanediol at different time points. And I basically dosed it for two weeks to keep my ketone levels at two millimolar, which would be like a therapeutic. And when you do that, what you will see, and I — well, I was going to say, I tell people that go ahead and do it, but maybe don’t do this. But when you take something like 1,3-Butanediol at a dose, which for me requires 30 milliliters three times per day to keep at two millimolar throughout the course of the day. If you do that for two weeks and then you test your transaminases, so that would be AST, ALT, and GGT, they will go up, so that’s a clear indication that — so we’ve done this in animals and fed it at a pretty high level, and we did not see transaminases going up. Tim Ferriss: So transaminases are what people could think of as liver enzymes on their blood panels, right? ALT. Is GGT typically tested? Dominic D’Agostino: GGT is like the wild carb, but what’s good about GGT is it’s the canary in the coal mine. It will go up before ALT and AST. If you expect someone has a problem with alcohol and they say they’re not drinking and you want to figure out if they’re drinking or not, say, “Hey, can I see your blood work and make sure the doctor adds GGT just to get a better,” and that’s elevated and your AST are not. The only things that’ll really shoot up GGT is like alcohol. And also the size of the red blood cell too can be if they’re like larger, that’s an indication like someone’s drinking too much alcohol. And it could be just like two or three glasses a day, but that will elevate GGT. So we observed that transaminases actually didn’t go up in our animals fed. The ketone esters or 1,3-Butanediol chronically, but when we pulled the livers out and then looked at the livers, then we saw things that concerned us. And we published this recently. And it’s good to know when someone has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, they can have normal transaminases but have a necrotic liver. Tim Ferriss: Yuck. I did not know that. It’s terrifying. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you look very closely at ALT longitudinally and that creeps up, but you basically have to do like a CT scan or a high resolution ultrasound of the liver. And basically, you could just take a subset of the American population that trends to be overweight and you do some liver scans and you find that they can have overt fatty liver disease and have completely normal transaminases are just trending up, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Dominic D’Agostino: So my liver enzymes tend to trend a little bit higher just because I eat a lot of protein. So with 1,3-Butanediol and 1,3-Butanediol based ketone esters, you have a problem with tolerability, palatability, potentially feasible pharmacokinetics and also toxicity. So it almost like checks all the boxes in a negative way. So the field is trending towards non 1,3-Butanediol based exogenous ketones, and that could be free acids, it could be a triester with glycerol and also the ketone electrolyte salts, but you could also avert part of this just by formulation. The issue is that companies have one molecule and then they test that one molecule, but you could — I think formulation is the way to go. And companies don’t want to hear that because they have all their IP in one molecule. But we’ve always been a formulation kind of based lab, and always saw that these things always have drawbacks when used as a monotherapy, but when you start combining them together, that’s when you get better therapeutic effects. Tim Ferriss: Got the hounds out there. Hopefully, not next to the gators. We won’t spend any time on this, but I just wanted to tell people that before we start recording, you’re telling me that you caught a 10-foot alligator that was trying to eat your dogs and then you pinned it down and taped its mouth and then measured its glucose and ketones. Turns out that alligator had a pretty good GKI, but that’s a story for another time. So only in the things that Dom would do category that stand out, but we’re talking about a lot of terms that are likely unfamiliar to folks. I don’t want to throw anybody under the bus here, but people should do their homework. 1,3-Butanediol is very, very, very common. It’s very inexpensive, or relatively inexpensive to produce. So just keep an eye out for 1,3-Butanediol. If this is of interest to you, I have no investment in any ketone supplement company or anything. I do not have a stake in this, but I would like to ask a couple of things. So I have experimented, as you know, with ketone monoester, diester, ketone salts, I’ve played with everything, and I’ve found the diester to cause quite a bit of intestinal discomfort, to put it mildly, at least the first one or two times. I will say for folks, if at first you don’t succeed, meaning you have to run to the toilet. You may acclimate to it, which I did in that case, but I felt subjectively less and less effect. I seem to develop tolerance very quickly. I don’t know why that would be the case, but I seem to experience it. The ketone monoester, which is the 1,3-Butanediol bound to BHB, if I understand it correctly, right? I do like that. I like the subjective feeling of it, but if that’s only at about 11 milliliters. If I take 25 plus, speaking to your pharmacokinetics, right? Like the stock pops and then it drops and then I feel very tired and often feel more anxiety. It seems to prompt in me more anxiety. I mean, look, we got to talk about this. Not that it invalidates what you’re saying in any way, but your wife runs a company that sells ketone salts, which I also I’ve been using most consistently. Keto’s Therapy, people can check it out. But on the ketone monoester, what I’m wondering is if I’m only taking, let’s say, 11 milliliters once or twice a day, and I’m taking it alongside MCT oil, where would you put the risk analysis on something like that? Dominic D’Agostino: I would say, the risk is very minimal for a healthy person. So I have a super healthy liver. I even take N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, all these things. So I was surprised to see sort of liver climbing. What we see in our older animals is that they are selectively vulnerable to 1,3-Butanediol toxicity from acutely and also chronically. So for a normal healthy person, especially someone that’s sort of really good metabolic health and liver function and they don’t drink or drugs that compromise the liver, I would say upwards of 1,3-Butanediol 20 to 20 milliliters a day is probably where you want to cap it and maybe not do it every day. 1,3-Butanediol based ketone ester would do that, but you can also probably achieve and maintain the same level of ketosis with a ketone salt, a beta-hydroxybutyrate salt. And I do like the idea of a D and the L, the two enantiomers, which is a conversation that you may or may not want to have. So the L is basically like, it’s packaged beta-hydroxybutyrate in the time release form and it has some signaling effects. And then you have free acids too that are coming up on the market, and various liposomal formulations. I’m not sure if they’re commercially available yet, but these are some things in the pipeline. But yeah, 1,3-Butanediol based monoester, I think there’s good data behind it. I think the science that’s published is biased under the direction because that was the molecule that a lot of companies associate with, and then they test that molecule in and of itself as a monotherapy. And I am of the opinion that things are definitely optimized. You could avert a lot of the problems just by formulation. Tim Ferriss: How does the MCT oil help? I guess basically it makes the ramp up more gradual. Is that the effect that the sort of co-consumption of the MCT oil has? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. It delays gastric absorption for one thing, but it’s also stimulating your endogenous production. So the MCT goes to the liver, not through like chylomicrons, it goes right to the liver and stimulates your body’s ketone production. And I think that’s important. It’s almost like training your liver to ramp up fat oxidation, and it’s almost like exercising your liver to stimulate it. What we’ve also observed, and we published on that, like a large dose of MCT, when you take the liver out and look at it, there’s globules of fat all in the liver. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that sounds bad. Dominic D’Agostino: Well, we see a fatty liver, but we did not see evidence of necrosis, but we did see some inflammatory markers. Tim Ferriss: Necrosis is dead tissue, dead cells. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Yeah, we did not see that, but we saw signs. We saw sinusoidal dilation and TNF-α was elevated and some other things to suggest that large doses of MCT. And if you do the human equivalence, it would be like me taking upwards of like 80 to 100 milliliters per day. So that’s a lot. Tim Ferriss: Although, it’s not that much though, right? I mean, because 30 milliliters is like two tablespoons, is that roughly, right? So it’s like six tablespoons. If you’re just squirting it into your coffee, it’s not hard to necessarily get above a hundred. It’s actually pretty easy. So where would you recommend capping MCT consumption? I’ll get rid of my camel back with the MCT oil in it, but where would you recommend capping the MCT consumption? Dominic D’Agostino: The studies that were done showing benefits is like 20 milliliters per day, but they only did a single dose, which is weird, but that was the old Axona studies. And like 80 percent of people tolerated that, 20 percent didn’t. But I’m of the opinion that 20 milliliters twice per day would be perfectly fine for essentially most people that can tolerate that. And you’re going to have probably about 30 percent or more that can, but MCT is much more tolerable when you take it with a meal. So if you take MCT on empty stomach, prepare to be closer to a bathroom, right? So yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Of all the disgusting things that I have consumed in my life, and I’ve had a lot, right? I mean, I’ve tried early prototypes of some of the esters and all sorts of stuff. I’m not going to say it was a Piña Colada, but I was fine with it. MCT oil to this day, I just find so absolutely revolting. I don’t know if it’s the neutrality and the mouth feel, but mixed with the mackerel and that apple cider vinegar, it sounds so disgusting. My friend almost puked in his mouth yesterday when I was describing it. It’s actually really good. I’m just a sucker for mackerel. I’ll take mackerel over sardines all day long, but — let’s see here… So I think we’ve covered a lot of the exogenous ketones. I’ll just pull this from our text thread because I think it might be a question on some people’s minds. As I was trying to troubleshoot my apparent failure mode with ketosis because of my low numbers, I asked you, is there any argument to be made that I should have a ketogenic breakfast instead of intermittent fasting? Could it be that I’m causing problems with exogenous ketones, right? Am I delaying potentially the onset of my own ketosis? Is it like TRT, right? If you’re taking exogenous, remember that word, if you’re injecting or rubbing on or swallowing testosterone, it’s like your Leydig cells are pretty smart. That’s the reason your balls turn into Raisinets is because it’s like, “Cool, we don’t have to make that anymore.” So I thought, am I shooting myself in the foot by taking exogenous ketones? And it sounds like a little bit goes a long way, but like most things, in excess, it becomes its opposite, right? It becomes a hindrance and makes it problematic. Is that fair to say? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. We’ve only seen the anti-endogenous ketosis effect with 1,3-Butanediol or 1,3-Butanediol-based ketone esters, and that is due in part to their potency and also the rapid elevation of ketones seem to have an insulin effect that can double or triple insulin. And even if we elevate ketones to the same level with a salt, we don’t see that spike up in insulin. So that could be coming into play with your low ketones if you are consuming the monoester. Tim Ferriss: Not much. Every once in a while, like before exercise, because I might not mind the spike, but I’m not consuming a ton. Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: But the breakfast, I’m of the opinion that protein loading in the morning, actually when you first wake up, and I think Donald Layman and maybe Stu Phillips would also agree with this, and maybe Layne Norton too, the protein guys in the camp, is that protein in the morning kind of amps up your metabolism throughout the rest of the day. And I think if you abstain from eating during the day, you tend to get the munchies later in the day and you tend to overeat, whereas if you have a protein-heavy meal in the morning with high fat, then that can sort of rev up your metabolism for a good part of the day. But then again, some people, me included, my mind is not as sharp when I have — Tim Ferriss: Well, that’s the thing. That’s the thing, right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would say that, I mean, for 15 years, the sort of 30 grams within 30 minutes of waking up has been this sort of easy to remember heuristic that I’ve recommended for folks and that, if I am not intermittent fasting, that’s also what I do, but I’ve become so addicted to the mental sharpness that it’s just like, man, I know that if, for instance, if I want to do three hours of writing, I do not want to have food immediately prior to that. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But I would say, I’m also at a point, I think, where throwing up really heavy weight for me and getting as big and strong as possible is just not — it’s less of a priority than it once was, after shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries and various things. Not that I want to be the skinniest guy in the room, but — Okay. It sounds like the pharmacokinetics are maybe to blame with the associated spike in insulin for some of the issues you might run into if you’re taking the 1,3-Butanediol-based products. Dominic D’Agostino: It can be, and I suspect it is, and I’ve kind of proven with myself that’s the case, but it also can be mitigated in part by mixing, taking it with a meal or taking it with MCT. But then you get the — it is metabolized, like 30 milliliters of 1,3-Butanediol is kind of like 30 milliliters of ethanol. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: And then 1,3-Butanediol can create dependence and it also can create — you get withdrawal. So it’s establishing literature. There’s several publications just showing that with 1,3-Butanediol will produce dependency, and when you abruptly stop 1,3-Butanediol after consuming it for a period of time, there’s essentially alcohol withdrawal from that. Tim Ferriss: What are the symptoms of that? I mean, imagine you don’t get DT, right? You’re not getting shakes or anything, are you? But, I mean, what happens? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, it is, I mean, it’s like classical kind of ethanol withdrawal, maybe not quite as dramatic, but the glycols or diol alcohols do have a GABAergic effect, so you’re doing that. And yeah, I mean, it’s well established it has narcotic-like properties and that kind of stymied its use as a synthetic food for space flight. Well, I think that the palatability also factored into that, but also in the literature, it notes a narcotic effect of this and then the animal studies and really showed dependency and withdrawal. Tim Ferriss: Just to give a reiteration of that, I mean, the 1,3-Butanediol-based stuff is also sold as an alcohol replacement. So of course, being the idiot that I am, not idiot, just like I’m eager to experiment here and there if it’s not going to kill me, and so I thought, “You know what? I don’t want to drink tonight.” I remember where I was. I was in Upstate New York, about to go to a restaurant with a friend. I knew he would want to drink, and then I wanted to be able to say, “Hey, I already had this ahead of time. Don’t worry. We’re on the same level.” And I chugged a small can. It wasn’t, in terms of liquid volume, a lot, right? I don’t know, six ounces, eight ounces. And I felt like I could barely walk to the bathroom. I was smashed. It was, like almost knocked a glass off the table. I was like, “Holy shit, I did not do this risk assessment properly. Thank God I’m not about to get into a car,” because it took a little while to wear off. So that narcotic effect is really, it’s not always subtle. Dominic D’Agostino: I made jello shots. I made 1,3-Butanediol jello shots. And before we made the ketone esters in 2009, Patrick Arnold and I kind of formulated this. Tim Ferriss: Patrick Arnold. So people who don’t recognize Patrick, listen to my conversation with him from years ago, but if you know BALCO or remember when Barry Bonds grew a few head sizes or any of that stuff, anyway, Patrick’s got some stories. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So the jello shots, so what happened with the jello shots? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, that was the way to get it down because 1,3-Butanediol is so nasty, right? So you could basically just warm up pure 1,3-Butanediol in a pot and then add cherry-flavored sugar-free jello and then stir it up and then pour it into like a cookie pan and then cut it into cubes, which you get 20 milliliters per jello shot, and make it pretty strong so it’s like firm jello, and I would just hit like two or three of them and just be buzzing. And I talk about it, like 1,3-Butanediol can be fun and it’s a lesser of two evils when we’re talking about ethanol. So I actually tried to file a patent for the use of 1,3-Butanediol for alcohol withdrawal and things like that. But actually, there was some prior art on that, and this is many years ago, but I actually do think it could be part used by people if they could transition off of ethanol, potentially use that, but there are other ways to get off alcohol. I’m not advocating for that. But my concern, is why I’m talking about it now too, is that I know there’s older people out there with dementia, perhaps Alzheimer’s disease, that if they’re consuming 1,3-Butanediol as a ketogenic supplement, it’s going to make you dizzy. It’s going to decrease your stability, like it’s going to make you potentially fall, break your hip. And then when you’re older, your liver, your ability to detoxify alcohol, an 80-year-old only has like 20 or 30 percent of the capacity to do that. So the same amount of 1,3-Butanediol for a 20-year-old is going to be like three to five times harder on your liver as we age, right? And people note that, like as you age, you just can’t tolerate the same amount of alcohol. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: So I think these things, the 1,3-Butanediol-based supplements, the straight up 1,3-Butanediol and 1,3-Butanediol-based ketone esters are problematic for the age population that I think some of these products or companies are targeting. And I say that not only as a scientist, but because of the volume of emails that I get on that. People were like, “I got super buzzed. I didn’t know what happened.” And some people are very sensitive to it, like I gave my wife — she can’t tolerate alcohol at all and she took a shot glass of the stuff and she could not believe that it was a legal supplement to sell. And now this will probably interest a lot of people, so they’ll probably go out and buy it, but I’m just saying like if you’re sensitive to alcohol, you’re going to get overly buzzed, and my concern is that, hey, if you want to use it for recreational, that’s your thing and maybe it’s better than alcohol, but for older people, a large dose of 1,3-Butanediol is problematic from a narcotic, from just the potential for just getting drunk, just straight up drunk. And Dr. Veech told me that a long time ago, I was like, because I was trying to get the ester from him and I was like, “What if I just use 1,3-Butanediol?” It’s like, “You’ll get drunk.” So it’s like he instilled that, that, “Do not do that.” That’s what he said. Tim Ferriss: And Veech was the co-inventor, is that fair to say, of the bonded monoester that was funded in part by, was it the DOD or DARPA? Dominic D’Agostino: DARPA. Tim Ferriss: DARPA and then patented at Oxford. Is that right? Am I getting my facts straight or am I getting things mixed up? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Well, Oxford sort of acquired the IP and made a company out of it, but we have to credit Dr. Richard Veech, who passed away a few years ago, for the conception of a ketone ester for just — Dr. Veech was the student of Hans Kreb. Tim Ferriss: Kreb of Krebs cycle? Dominic D’Agostino: Krebs cycle, yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s wild. Wow. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I went to Dr. Veech’s lab at the NIH. I saw the whole ketone process, I tested different things. We were in communication, and I think he was a very colorful character and he had an amazing mind. We disagreed, we agreed to disagree on some things, but I consider him a mentor of mine, and I think we all owe a lot. I don’t think exogenous ketones may even not exist. Well, Henri Brunengraber and some other people, Sami Hashim developed the triester. So there was other people in this space, but he really advanced the science and ultimately the application of exogenous ketones and I think has written extensively about it. I mean, these things were around for a long time, and I think as science advances, we have more information and then we can — I have pivoted away from these things, although we still use them in some experiments. I published some really nice data on 1,3-Butanediol, actually even in cancer studies too, but at the same time, I realized that the negative effects, I can pivot away from that. We have other molecules in development now. Tim Ferriss: So I know as I’m watching things get dark on the East Coast for you that we’ll wrap up in just a few minutes. But in brief, you mentioned fat, salt, fiber as things that can be helpful for slowing, I guess, gastric emptying of these meals that I’m having. And I’m curious for you, on a ketogenic diet, what are your favorite sources of fiber, supplemental or in whole food form? Dominic D’Agostino: Whole food form. I like broccoli, and I buy broccoli florets, and then I cut the tip of the floret off, and I have a bowl of that and I give the stalk and stuff to my dogs and I chop it up for their fiber. So that’s something that I do, I don’t know, just to get a higher dose of broccoli. But broccoli, and then wild blueberries that has about half of the sugar and more fiber. They’re about a quarter of the size of like the huge blueberries you buy at, like, Walmart. But so wild blueberries, I like apples because they have a certain fiber called pectin in it. Some people that have a problem with fiber can’t digest pectin or they get gassy, so it’s on the FODMAP list or whatever. But wild blueberries, just green vegetables in general, but I like broccoli, and apples are pretty much something I have every day. Tim Ferriss: Now, the wild blueberries, I just want to really underline wild for people because that is not what you’re necessarily going to get at your local grocery store that’s been optimized to be as sweet as — Dominic D’Agostino: No. They’re in Publix. So I can get them in Publix down here. And I think, I don’t know, actually I think they’re in Walmart too. I think you can go to Walmart, and I think you might have to sneak around for them, but there’s like a brand, they have wild raspberries and blueberries and blackberries together. I forget the name of the brand, but they come in like big two or three-pound bags too. Tim Ferriss: How much can you eat of apples or berries before undoing all the good metabolic work that you’re doing in ketosis, right? Because even, for instance, we’ve talked about how easy it is, and it really is easy as long as you’re pretty simple to please dietarily, to, say, travel for keto, right? So you just pack a bunch of canned sardines, mackerel, maybe some oysters, and macadamia nuts, and you’re kind of good to go, like these things are pretty calorically dense. But the macadamia nuts, I was looking at the bag the other day because it’s one of the few kind of crunchy things that I feel like I can eat aside from some of these vegetables, and I was like, “Wow, if you go whole hog in the macadamia nuts, you can rack up the carbs after a while.” What about apples and berries? Where’s your cutoff point for yourself? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, macadamia nuts actually have that three-to-one to four-to-one ratio of fat to — so they are pretty high in fat, but like cashews and then like almonds and other nuts. I like walnuts too, I forgot to mention. So I have walnuts, a small organic apples we buy, wild blueberries, and broccoli pretty much every day, and all that together ends up being about 60 to 70 grams of carbs, but one third of the carbs is fiber, so it’s essentially non-glycemic. I haven’t had any of that today, but I tend to have that at dinner and then my snack at nighttime. So everything that I just mentioned, the carbs. But I don’t think about it as undoing like ketosis, and I do think my glucose tank is always like maybe 10 or 20 percent full, so I’m always running kind of low on glucose, and on some days I’m more active. Tim Ferriss: What’s your height and weight, Dom, at the moment? Dominic D’Agostino: Six foot, 220, and I’ve been, give or take, five pounds for years now, yeah. So just always cruise at like 220. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean — Dominic D’Agostino: 100 kilograms. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, good body composition. That is a lot of muscle for people who are not watching the video. I’m just trying to set the maybe context for what your tolerance might be for grams of carbohydrates. Dominic D’Agostino: I have pretty good tolerance for carbs now, but I think I have good tolerance more now because I’ve titrated some carbs back in, because I did go probably at least five years on like very low, like clinical ketogenic. And I did end up losing like almost like 18 pounds of like lean body mass, and then I took a year off in 2018, when we bought our farm. I was very busy on the farm. Then I bought weights and just have it on the farm. And then I’ve been doing DEXA. My last DEXA, it was 218, but under — I was like 9.8 percent body fat, like still under 10 percent. But I gained muscle when I got back into lifting and just did the heavy compound movements again. I don’t go super crazy on the weight, but I do train hard. But — Tim Ferriss: You found the addition of the carbohydrates to be beneficial, that slightly higher quantity of carbohydrates? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. I’ve added more carbs back in over the years, and that has helped me maintain my body weight. And I like eating those foods. I enjoy those foods. I think they have beneficial fiber, phytonutrients, other micronutrients that I think are beneficial. And I can maintain a level of ketosis about 0.5 to 1.5 day in and day out eating those foods every day. And I do titrate in like the MCTs and I get like one or two packets of KetoStart of day, maybe up to three if I’m traveling, but that’s my normal protocol and that has optimized all my biomarkers. I actually got full blood work today. Kind of waiting for that to come back to see. It should be interesting. I was inadvertently took something that I thought was laced with something, some gummies I told you about, but — Tim Ferriss: People are going to assume. When people hear gummies, they assume it’s THC, but this was what, theanine and magnesium? It should have been really innocuous, right? Is that right? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Theanine and magnesium, my wife bought it at Marshalls. We both took two. We woke up in the morning and she says,” I’m dizzy.” She’s asking me, “What did you give me last night?” I was like, “I didn’t give you anything.” Because sometimes I give her stuff. I tried to get up, fell flat on the floor. Both of us could not walk. We were both completely incapacitated. I called the Poison Control Center. And yeah, so basically I’ve been running around to different labs, and now I’m doing forensics, so do something. I’m still buzzed — Tim Ferriss: Wow. Really? Dominic D’Agostino: — so if I don’t seem like myself, because I’m still buzzed 48 hours later. So we took something — Tim Ferriss: That is wild. Dominic D’Agostino: We had the spinnies, and even this morning I woke up, I had the spinnies walking to — so whatever it was, it was pretty powerful. And I have a little bit of a back injury from about a week ago, and I don’t have any pain from that. So I think whatever it is, I’m thinking potentially a fentanyl derivative or something, but — Tim Ferriss: Yikes, that’s terrifying. Dominic D’Agostino: My wife does not drink, she doesn’t use any drugs, so she was pretty much really floored by this. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Did you go back and buy some more of them to send off to get analyzed? Dominic D’Agostino: Well, I have it. Yeah. So I collected my urine, my wife collected her urine, and then I’m doing the necessary blood work, and I’ve contacted a forensic lab, and we have doctors involved in all this now. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Dosed the wrong guy. Or the right guy, because you imagine like what if that had been a 80-year-old woman sleeping on the second floor. I mean, that’s dangerous. Dominic D’Agostino: Absolutely. Yep, absolutely. I just took two and I’m a pretty big guy and everything, but if a little kid took two or four or five — so obviously, I don’t know, the company, and the company you can find it on Amazon, mixed it up and it’s laced with something or they just put high concentration THC and I kind of know what, but this is, we’re talking 48 hours later and I’m still feeling it. Tim Ferriss: That’s wild. Dominic D’Agostino: I’m super curious with my blood work, so I’m waiting for that to come in. Be careful, people out there because — Tim Ferriss: Be careful of those gummies, folks. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Not regulated. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Dom, is there anything else you would like to mention or anywhere you’d like to point people before we wind this to a close? Dominic D’Agostino: I don’t think so. I mean, we talked a lot about like sardine fasting and everything, I think, before. Tim Ferriss: In the prior conversation, yeah. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, yeah. I’d like to credit to Dr. Annette Bosworth, Dr. Boz, because, I mean, I’ve kind of came up with this idea, but it got traction, and I think she has — a lot of people that email me about sardine fasting heard it from Dr. Boz, and she’s amplified the message with millions of YouTube followers. But she kind of took an idea and actually put it into practice and amplified it through a lot of people, and then those people emailed me about it, so that amplified and secured my knowledge. “Yes, okay, these benefits are…” And now she’s been on like Diary of a CEO podcast, I think, and some other podcasts. So I’d also like to mention, I’m testing today even, there’s a company coming out, I don’t know if I can mention or not, but I will, Medifoodz. And for years, there’s no whole food-based ketogenic diet prescription foods. So I have no association with the company, I’m just testing their product, but they’re called Medifoodz. And Tim Ferriss: How do you spell that? M-E-T-I? M-E-T — Dominic D’Agostino: M-E-D-I-F-O-O- Tim Ferriss: Oh, Medi. I got it. Medifoodz. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, Medifoodz. With a Z. And I got to tell you, these are like gourmet foods, and then they hit the macros of a modified ketogenic diet. And we talked about if someone says the ketogenic diet is not palatable, they have to see these foods. They’re prescription whole food. There’s other companies that tried to do this, and they even got like the packaging is like compostable, like it looks like plastic, but I could throw it in my garden and it breaks down. I’m very impressed with this. I just mentioned that because I just got these foods yesterday and I was really impressed, but other companies have not been so impressive. So Medifoodz is pretty impressive. And Quest Nutrition tried to do this a while back and I think their foods were good, but they got a new CEO and just phased it out. But I like the idea of a prescription, whole food, ketogenic diet that potentially a doctor could write a prescription. And a week of foods could be sent to the patients. I’ve been questioning why someone has not done this, but I know the margins are very small in the food world, so it’s hard to kind of get that up and running. Tim Ferriss: I mean, they could take the approach that a lot of companies take, a lot of tech startups take, like Uber, Tesla, et cetera, you sell in the beginning for much higher price to people who are willing to pay that. You use that to subsidize the R&D or the scale necessary to then offer, right? Instead of Uber Black, you have UberX, and similarly for a lot of companies. I mean, I would pay for this, right? And yeah, I wouldn’t say totally price-insensitive, but I’m willing to pay for convenience because there does come a point where I’ve had enough canned mackerel and salads with rib eye that I would love to have something else in any case. So I will check out Medifoodz. Let’s see. Dom, are you active on social anywhere? Should people find you anywhere online? Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah, I’m not too active, but I try to jump on about once or twice a week, and I cap my social to maybe an hour a week. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Smart man. Dominic D’Agostino: I try to respond back to things, yeah. Kind of delete the apps from my phone or some of them, but I repost things and try to acknowledge some questions and stuff people have on this, and then I collect questions and then — we have our own podcast, the Metabolic Link Podcast. And we have a Metabolic Initiative Platform which has ACCME accreditation, so it’s like you can get CME credits from it. So that has been a project that we’re working on and trying to advance everything we’re talking about into human application through that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Beautiful. Well, I’m trying to think of any other links. Are there any other links that you want to mention? And we’ll stick these all in the show notes as well for people. Dominic D’Agostino: Yeah. Ketonutrition.org. No products. I don’t sell anything. So ketonutrition.org information website, the Metabolic Link Podcast, and the Metabolic Health Initiative Education Platform are like the three biggies, I think. Tim Ferriss: Beautiful. We will link to all those things for people listening as well as — God save — People who help me do the show notes, they’re going to have a lot to dig through, but we will link to everything that we can find a link for at tim.blog/podcast. Just search Dominic, and this will be the most recent episode. I mean, we may have some in the future, so you’ll find it. And Dom, thank you so much for taking the time, man. Always great to see you. Dominic D’Agostino: My pleasure. Thank you, Tim, for having me. Appreciate it. Good seeing you.Tim Ferriss: Yeah.

Title: Shoulda Called It ‘Omni-scient’; Google’s Core Tremors

Omnicom’s Omnipotence Publicis has had a nice run. But is 2026 the year of the Omnicom? On Wednesday, Omnicom announced what it calls the next generation of Omni, its central identity and analytics service. The new Omni, which integrates data and technology beneath the Omnicom umbrella, underscores the broader industry trend toward consolidation. The upgrade stems in part from Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group, which closed in November, making Omnicom the largest agency holding company by revenue. The deal also brought valuable assets into the fold, chief among them the Acxiom Real ID, an IPG-owned identity solution that is now a part of Omni. Omnicom is also leaning harder into Flywheel (acquired in 2024) to power Omni’s shopper intelligence. And, on top of that, the new Omni product comes with a new agentic AI framework (because of course). The final pillar of the new and improved Omni is Interact, which was also IPG’s name for essentially the same centralized data and analytics service. So what’s the message here for agency holdcos? It doesn’t hurt to be holding a lot of co’s. Core Workout Google Search rolled out a broad core update in December, its first since last June. Such updates typically happen a few times per year, so Google was due. SEO consultant Glenn Gabe breaks down the data from Google’s latest update in a blog post. First, some spammy redirect sites unexpectedly thrived thanks to the new update. Google has regular minor core updates to fix mistakes, Gabe writes, “but it’s interesting to see this happen with major updates focused on quality.” And the December update ignored blatant shameless efforts to improve rankings in AI chatbot searches. One cringeworthy example is to publish listicles that prominently feature your own brand. “It’s a cheesy tactic, and sort of embarrassing for companies doing that, but it works (at least for now),” Gabe writes. Reddit, meanwhile, continues to feast on Google’s AI search overhaul. This time, it’s using Google’s language-translation AI to connect its non-English user base with Google Search results. Google’s broad core update from last April and others before it boosted Reddit as a scaled source of authentic commentary and product reviews. At the same time, and unrelatedly (*wink*), Reddit signed a series of advantageous-to-Google data-sharing and advertising partnerships. Primed For Déjà Vu Recurring ads have become an unfortunate staple of the streaming experience. In more Omnicom news, Omnicom Media announced an effort during CES to address TV’s frequency problem, Digiday reports. To help buyers better understand the connection between frequency and conversions, the holdco is integrating TV viewing data from Roku, audience data from Acxiom and shopper insights from Amazon Ads within its Omni platform. Good plan. But TV’s frequency problem has stumped the ad industry for years. Remember when FreeWheel launched a Viewer Experience Lab in 2023 to try and nail the balance between ad frequency and viewer aversion? Well, it’s still far from a perfect science. Key to Omnicom’s efforts is reducing how long it takes for advertisers to see frequency impact reporting from months down to just a day or two. And Acxiom, now part of Omnicom post-IPG merger, could also help the holdco by strengthening its closed-loop attribution, which would help cut down on ad waste. For now, though, ad-supported streamers can only hope for some relief from the ad bombardment. But Wait!

More from the series → This week’s Media Briefing looks at the main business areas publishing executives have their sights set on as they head into 2026, recalibrating around AI advertising revenue opportunities, brand marketing, and video and creator opportunties, after a humbling 2025. Media execs have big goals for 2026. They’re setting their sights on AI revenue and visibility opportunities, brand marketing pushes, plus a big year in U.S. politics and sports. They may have emerged bruised by a rocky 2025, which hit them with a new search landscape, AI copyright battles and a challenging advertising market. But as the year turns, there’s a sense of renewed resolve. At least that’s the tone for now, according to recent Digiday conversations and seven media execs from CNN, Forbes, Future, Hearst, USA Today Co., The Wall Street Journal, and Vox Media, Digiday spoke with for this story. AI advertising revenue opportunities Publishers are increasingly turning to AI as a practical tool inside their ad businesses. Expect to see publishers integrate AI more deeply into their media buying, yield management and ad sales functions this year, using it to price inventory, package audiences more effectively and extract more value from fewer visits. “In 2026, we’re moving past the ‘experimental’ phase of AI. At Dow Jones, our advertising focus is on using these tools to make our partnerships more precise,” said Josh Stinchomb, global CRO at The Wall Street Journal. The business publisher is integrating generative AI into everything from the initial client research phase to the way it builds and refines brands’ media plans in real-time, helping its ads business move faster with deeper insights that can improve performance, he noted. Other publishers are experimenting with building in-house, media buying AI agents to help automate the process of analyzing, planning and curating RFPs — another area that will evolve this year. This is all buoyed by the fact that publishing execs are seeing the first quarter of 2026 off to a good start, with ad revenue pacing better this month compared to previous years for some, thanks to premium video, and direct and PMP deals. AI visibility gains and KPI changes Publishers’ KPIs are shifting as traffic and scale fade as the key metric for a successful media business. Top publishing execs are orienting their businesses entirely around KPIs, like conversion and engagement metrics, including subscriptions, registrations, and overhauling sites to make them stickier so that even if they get fewer visits, they’re more valuable. What this ultimately means for goals and targets facing SEO and audience teams this year remains unclear, but it’s likely to become apparent soon. Resources are also now being funneled into tracking newer metrics like AI visibility, or how often a publisher is mentioned or cited in an AI search tool. Media execs are working with third-party tools — or building their own analytics — to get a better understanding of how, when and why they’re being mentioned across AI products. U.K.-based publisher Future recently built its own AI visibility measurement tool to do just that. The insights from that tool, called Future Optic, is key to the company’s editorial and branded content strategy this year, according to Future CRO Michael Peralta. “We’re only on first base on some of the stuff that we’re doing around AI and working with LLMs, so that’s a big deal for us for [this] year,” he said. Brand marketing push AI visibility measurement tools aren’t the only thing publishers are putting more resources behind. With search and social algorithms deprioritizing news, publishers are revisiting brand marketing, as they can no longer rely on organic traffic or discovery from platforms. “One of my big goals [for 2026] is for [people] to really know us as Future… We have [all of these different brands], and we also have scale,” Peralta said. The Financial Times debuted a marketing campaign for its subscription product on Wednesday, across TV, out of home, audio, digital and social. Publishers like Hearst, NBC News and Reuters ratcheted up their brand marketing last year, debuting expansive campaigns across platforms. The Economist also told Digiday it had big plans to bolster its brand marketing, in part by promoting access to more content for free to increase registration and subscription conversions. More media companies will funnel money into these campaigns to draw attention to their companies and the content they produce. “In a world of content commoditization, our biggest priority is to succinctly communicate how our brands, shows and podcasts add unique value to consumers and customers,” said Geoff Schiller, Vox Media CRO. Video expansions and creator collaborations News outlets like Time, CNN, The New York Times added more vertical video to their sites and apps at the end of last year, to appeal to audiences and marketers accustomed to consuming content and buying ads in this format on social media feeds. For Time and Recurrent Ventures, video ad revenue will be one of the biggest growth drivers of their businesses in 2026. Likewise, Guy Griggs, svp of ad sales and client partnerships at CNN, said his top priority for 2026 is to expand and monetize more brand-safe online video and streaming content. At the same time, publishers are building their own networks of creators they can invest in to collaborate on personality-led video, to drive more video ad revenue and audience engagement. Publishers like Yahoo and Future are focused on expanding their creator networks this year. “I think we’ve got a really good right to win in the retail media space, particularly with our high-intent audience. We can work with influencers and advertisers at scale [with our branded content business]. I think that’s going to be a big deal for us,” Future’s Peralta said. Hearst Magazines will expand more into its creator-driven, tentpole franchises this year, after seeing success from programs like ELLE’s Women in Hollywood, Bazaar’s Icons, according to Lisa Ryan Howard, global CRO of Hearst Magazines. “[We will expand] social-first video-led storytelling events and scaled creator integrations to help our partners break through with high-impact programs both domestically and globally,” she said. In 2026, Hearst Magazines is also focused on selling what it calls “360 Bundles,” or ad sales packages that include content production, creator collaborations, and distribution across multiple channels, Ryan Howard added. “More than ever, [we are] amping distribution offsite through social and video, live events, original editorial content collaborations, creator partnerships, newsletters [and] vodcasts,” she said. Meanwhile, Forbes is focused on expanding social and video content, creators and talent partnerships and event franchises, according to Leann Bonanno, the publisher’s chief sales and marketing officer. “In 2026, one of Forbes’ key business priorities is advancing a content strategy built for how audiences and advertising partners engage today — across digital, social, video, AI-driven discovery, and live experiences,” she said. Big election, sports year Like all the election years before it, the U.S. midterms this November represent a potential windfall of audience and ad revenue growth opportunities for news and politics publishers. USA Today Co. (formerly Gannett) is one of the news media orgs banking on this in 2026. In an election year, committing to a “facts-forward approach” for both center-right and center-left voters — is its focus, according to Kristin Roberts, USA Today Media president. This summer, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, providing another opportunity for USA Today Co. to increase its sports coverage this year from both its local and national brands, Roberts added. “Honestly, I think the days of just expecting a fully curated experience of what editors think you should see that day in kind of stacked headline format [on a homepage] — I think those days are over. It just is going to feel archaic to people. So I do think that they expect us to go the extra mile to learn more about them and give them results that are tailored to things they’re interested in.” — Nina Gould, chief innovation officer at Forbes 66%: The decline in the price of BuzzFeed’s stock in 2025, down to $0.93 on Dec. 31. 17,163: The number of job cuts at U.S.-based media companies (TV, film, digital publishing and broadcast) in 2025, an 18% increase from 2024. 3.88%: The year-over-year increase in display advertising revenue for members of the Association of Online Publishers (AOP). $50 million: The size of the investment from billionaire David Hoffmann in newspaper chain Lee Enterprises.

Title: Strategy saved from Index expulsion, yet a hidden clause effectively kills the infinite money loop for investors

With MSCI freeze blocking automatic buys, Strategy must pivot to active investors for new funding, challenging its Bitcoin acquisition model. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The threat of a massive forced sell-off in crypto-linked equities has been averted. However, that reprieve comes with a structural catch that fundamentally alters the economics of the “Bitcoin Treasury” trade. On Jan. 6, the dominant benchmark provider for global equity and ETF markets, MSCI Inc., announced it will retain “Digital Asset Treasury Companies” (DATCOs) in its global indices for the February 2026 review, sparing firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from expulsion. It stated: “For the time being, the current index treatment of DATCOs identified in the preliminary list published by MSCI of companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of their total assets will remain unchanged.” Following the news, Michael Saylor, Strategy's executive chairman, touted the victory of remaining in the benchmark. However, the index provider has simultaneously introduced a technical freeze on share counts for these entities. It explained: “MSCI will not implement increases to the Number of Shares (NOS), Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) or Domestic Inclusion Factor (DIF) for these securities. MSCI will defer any additions or size-segment migrations for all securities included in the preliminary list.” Through this decision, MSCI has effectively severed the link between new equity issuance and automatic passive buying. This move simply meant the “downside” of a forced liquidation has been removed, but the “upside” mechanics of the index trade have been dismantled The immediate market reaction, a surge of over 6% in Strategy’s stock, reflected relief that a catastrophic liquidity event was off the table. Notably, JPMorgan suggested that a full exclusion could have triggered between $3 billion and $9 billion in passive selling of MSTR. MSCI consultation paper and JPMorgan's positioning resulting in some major fallout across social media to defend DATs like Strategy. This volume would likely have crushed the stock price and forced the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. However, the removed threat of exclusion masks a new reality where the automatic demand lever for the stocks is gone. Historically, when Strategy issued new shares to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, the index provider would eventually update the share count. As a result, passive funds tracking the index were then mathematically compelled to buy a pro rata portion of the new issuance to minimize tracking error. This created a guaranteed, price-insensitive source of demand that helped absorb dilution. Under the new “freeze” policy, this loop is broken. Even if Strategy significantly expands its float to raise capital, MSCI will effectively ignore those new shares for index calculation purposes. The company’s weight in the index will not increase, and consequently, ETFs and index funds will not be forced to buy the new paper. Market analysts note that this shift forces a return to fundamentals. Without the backstop of benchmark-tracking demand, Strategy and its peers must now rely on active managers, hedge funds, and retail investors to absorb new supply. To understand the magnitude of this shift, market researchers are modeling the “lost bid” that issuers must now navigate. Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, quantified this liquidity gap in a note to clients. The firm posited a hypothetical scenario involving a treasury company with 200 million outstanding shares, of which roughly 10% are typically held by passive index trackers. In the Bull Theory model, if that company issues 20 million new shares to raise capital, the old index mechanics would eventually mandate that passive funds purchase 2 million of those shares. At a theoretical price point of $300 per share, that represents $600 million of automatic, price-insensitive buying pressure. Under MSCI’s new freeze, Bull Theory noted that the $600 million bid falls to zero. Considering this, it stated: “Strategy now must find private buyers, offer discounts, or raise less money.” This means that the forced demand from index funds has been eliminated. Thus, it presents a significant hurdle for Strategy, which issued more than $15 billion in new shares throughout 2025 to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. The arbitrage trade allowing firms to print equity for crypto is dead, leaving their $60 billion hoard structurally exposed. If the company attempts to replicate that scale of issuance in 2026, it will do so in a market void of passive support. Without that structural bid, the risk of a price correction during dilution events increases significantly. MSCI's decision to cap these companies rather than expel them or leave them alone has also significantly altered the competitive dynamics in the asset management sector. Over the past year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have matured as an asset class and have seen significant institutional interest. In fact, this rise led MSCI's former parent company, Morgan Stanley, to file for its own Spot Bitcoin ETF. From this vantage point, Strategy competes with these fee-bearing Bitcoin ETFs, offering investors a way to gain passive Bitcoin exposure through an operating company structure. By freezing the index weighting of DATCOs, the new rule degrades their ability to efficiently scale via equity markets. If Strategy’s ability to raise cheap capital is curtailed, large allocators may rotate capital out of the corporate equity and into Spot ETFs, which do not carry the operational risks of a company or the premium-to-NAV volatility. This flow of funds would directly benefit issuers of spot ETFs, including major Wall Street banks, effectively capturing the fees previously reflected in equity premiums. Inflows hit $697 million in days, yet the charts remain frozen because structured demand is neutralizing the rally. By neutering the “flywheel” effect of the treasury strategy, the index provider may have inadvertently, or intentionally, leveled the playing field in favor of traditional asset management products.

Title: Trump Takes on Buybacks, Dividends and Executive Pay at U.S. Defense Contractors

Time Published: 2026-01-07T22:14:16Z
Full Content:
The age-old practices of buying back shares and issuing dividends have a new—and perhaps unlikely—foe. President Donald Trump on Wednesday took aim at defense companies with stock buyback- and dividend-programs, saying they "will no longer be allowed or tolerated." In doing so, he revived a topic that has in recent years been a source of debate between those who see share repurchases as a straightforward method of supporting a company's stock and critics who believe that that cash could be put to better use. For Trump, meanwhile, it's the latest addition to the list of public-company matters—he also on Wednesday tackled executive compensation—over which the White House would like greater control. (He separately today also suggested a ban on large investor purchases of homes.) The Trump administration's direct involvement in the affairs of chipmakers and minerals companies have moved their respective stocks. Shares in defense shops were in the spotlight on Wednesday. Trump's hands-on approach has led to the government taking a cut of Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) "chip sales," a so-called golden share of U.S. Steel's sale to Nippon Steel, a 10% stake in Intel (INTC) that followed demands that the chipmaker's CEO be fired, and several equity stakes in rare earth minerals companies. All were justified as investments necessary for economic security and to mitigate national security risk. "Military equipment is not being made fast enough!" Trump said in posts on Truth Social and X. "It must be built now with the Dividends, Stock Buybacks, and Over Compensation of Executives, rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions, or getting the money from your government." Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and General Dynamics (GD) were down at least 4% by Wednesday's close. The question of how publicly traded companies use their cash is of interest to partisans of all stripe, though a distaste for corporate buyback programs might align Trump with his predecessor, President Biden, and Democratic leaders including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, and Elizabeth Warren. President Biden in 2022 signed into law a 1% excise tax of stock repurchases—though that has hardly put a dent in the practice. Companies in the S&P 500 spent more than $1 trillion in the 12 months ended September 2025, up from more than $918 billion in the prior year period, according to S&P Global. If Trump—who has also said companies shouldn't have to report earnings so frequently—is able to formalize his threat to bar companies in the defense sector from stock repurchases and dividends, it would ratchet up his brand of "state capitalism" up a notch—from deals to outright directives.

Title: Can Retirees Count on QYLD’s Amazing 11% Dividend Any More?

Time Published: 2026-01-07T17:31:51Z
Full Content:
Investing QYLD’s annual distributions have dropped 24% from $2.67 per share in 2021 to roughly $2.04 in 2025. QYLD returned 44% over five years while QQQ delivered 100%. The covered call strategy sacrificed over half the market’s gains. JEPQ uses active management to adjust option coverage instead of selling calls on 100% of holdings. It yields 9% with better total returns. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Inside Creative House / Shutterstock.com The Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NYSEARCA:QYLD) has attracted income-seeking investors with its impressive 11% yield, but recent trends suggest retirees should approach this fund with caution. The sustainability of this income stream faces meaningful headwinds. QYLD produces income through a covered call strategy on the NASDAQ 100 index. The fund holds the same tech-heavy stocks as the index—with top positions including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (9.2%), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (8.1%), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (7.3%)—but simultaneously sells call options on these holdings. When investors buy these call options, they pay premiums that become the fund’s primary income source. This generates consistent monthly cash flow but caps upside potential when markets rally. QYLD’s distribution history reveals a troubling pattern. Annual payouts have declined 24% from their 2021 peak of $2.67 per share to approximately $2.04 in 2025. Monthly payments now fluctuate between $0.16 and $0.19, reflecting the volatility-dependent nature of option premium income. When market volatility drops—as it has during recent periods of steady gains—the premiums QYLD can collect shrink accordingly. The mechanics are straightforward: covered call funds cannot grow dividends like traditional dividend stocks. They can only redistribute the option income they collect, which varies with market conditions. In low-volatility bull markets, QYLD’s income generation weakens. More concerning for retirees is QYLD’s massive underperformance relative to simply holding the NASDAQ 100. Over the past five years, QYLD returned 44% while the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) delivered 100%—a 56 percentage point gap. Even accounting for QYLD’s distributions, investors sacrificed more than half the market’s gains. The 10-year comparison is starker: QYLD’s 131% total return versus QQQ’s 447%. As Seeking Alpha analyst The Alpha Analyst noted in October 2025, “GPIQ’s active and flexible coverage is shown to outperform QYLD in various market conditions, offering better upside capture and reasonable downside protection.” Newer covered call strategies with dynamic approaches are now outpacing QYLD’s static methodology. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) employs an actively managed equity-linked notes strategy that provides similar income—currently yielding around 9%—while maintaining more flexibility to participate in market gains. The fund’s active approach allows managers to adjust option coverage based on market conditions rather than mechanically selling calls on 100% of holdings. With lower expenses and stronger total returns than QYLD, JEPQ represents an evolution in covered call strategies that addresses many of QYLD’s structural limitations. For income investors in 2026, JEPQ offers a more balanced approach to generating yield without completely sacrificing growth potential. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

January 07, 2026 10:15 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider News Commentary – The modern battlefield is being rewritten. It is no longer just about who has the biggest guns, but who can make the fastest decisions. This "speed imperative" is fueling a massive surge in the global military AI market, which is projected to rocket from $10.79 billion today to over $35.57 billion by 2035[1]. With hypersonic missiles and autonomous drones shrinking reaction times to mere seconds, global powers are rushing to secure "edge computing" tech that processes intelligence right at the point of action[2]. This shift from data storage to data speed is the primary catalyst for VisionWave Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), Spire Global, Inc. (NYSE: SPIR), and Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: IRDM). The stakes are massive. Space-based sensing is becoming a critical $13.02 billion industry as missile-tracking constellations become our world’s most essential defense infrastructure[3]. In these high-intensity zones, "computational acceleration" has emerged as the ultimate performance metric[4]. Success is no longer defined by raw processing power, but by the ability to collapse the "decision gap" and act while the enemy is still thinking. VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV) has executed a major strategic expansion with the acquisition of QuantumSpeed™, a pre-commercial computational engine designed to drastically reduce decision latency in defense systems. Supported by a $99.6 million independent valuation by BDO Consulting Group, this technology targets the critical split-second processing gap in modern warfare where standard computing is often too slow. The acquisition brings a proprietary "Hybrid Successive Approximation" framework intended to compress threat evaluation timelines from minutes into seconds. The transaction includes 3,000,000 common shares and a $10 million promissory note, reflecting insider confidence in the technology's scalability. "We believe this acquisition has the potential to contribute to redefining the time dimension of intelligence," said Douglas Davis, Executive Chairman of VisionWave. "In modern defense and autonomous operations, the value of data decays exponentially with every second of latency. QuantumSpeed targets the 'action gap' between sensing a threat and responding to it." While currently in the proof-of-concept phase, the operational goal is clear. VisionWave aims to enable radar systems to assess complex signal environments instantly and allow autonomous platforms to dynamically re-plan missions under contested conditions. "Every advanced system today eventually runs into the same wall: computation takes too long," added Dr. Danny Rittman, VisionWave CTO. "QuantumSpeed is designed to break that wall - not by adding more hardware, but by changing how computation itself is approached." This high-speed processing power complements the company's newly strengthened intellectual property portfolio. VisionWave recently announced the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 12,499,578, titled "Systems and Methods of Real-Time Movement, Position Detection, and Imaging," securing enforceable protection for its core RF imaging and AI platform. This patent solidifies the proprietary tech behind Argus, the company's space-enabled counter-drone system. The IP strategy now targets Argus's core architecture, including the SkyWeave high-frequency communications backbone essential for detection, tracking, and engagement. Momentum continues across the fleet. The recent acquisition of Solar Drone, a subsidiary of BladeRanger, provides access to massive solar markets in the U.S. and Europe. This follows a successful 100-day proof-of-concept with DB InfraGO AG, validating the tech for critical infrastructure. Additionally, VisionWave is advancing a potential £500,000 program with Evie Autonomous to enhance multi-sensor fusion in its "Varan" Unmanned Ground Vehicles. By combining the "eyes" of its patented RF imaging, the "brain" of QuantumSpeed, and the "body" of robotic platforms, VisionWave is building a multi-domain autonomy ecosystem. The company plans to fund up to $10 million in U.S. development over the next 6-12 months to push QuantumSpeed toward production readiness.

(NASDAQ: PLTR) announced a three-year renewal of its contract with the DGSI, France's domestic intelligence agency, extending a partnership that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The agreement relates to the supply of Palantir's proprietary software platform, integration, support and assistance services necessary for deployment and operational use, coming as national security challenges require robust, scalable technological capabilities meeting the highest standards in security, confidentiality and data governance. "We are very proud to support the DGSI in its crucial work in the service of France and its fight against terrorism," said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir. "This contract renewal reaffirms Palantir's commitment to serving the interests of France since 2016, and ensuring the security of the French people." Supported by a French team with France-based leadership and governance, Palantir's solutions have supported the French internal intelligence service in critical work including during major national events such as the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The renewal confirms Palantir's role as a technological partner standing with French institutions responsible for national security. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), received an $816 million contract from the U.S. Space Development Agency to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. The award is Rocket Lab's largest single contract to date and includes a $806 million base contract plus up to $10.45 million in options, with additional subsystem opportunities that could take the total capture value to approximately $1 billion. "The Tranche 3 Tracking Layer constellation is part of the U.S. Space Force's strategy to counter rapidly evolving global threats, ensuring the nation's defense capabilities remain ahead of adversaries," said Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab Corporation. "As the only commercial provider producing both spacecraft and payloads in-house for the SDA Tracking Layer, Rocket Lab is delivering a truly disruptive solution that combines speed, resilience, and affordability." Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats including hypersonic systems. This contract builds on Rocket Lab's existing $515 million award to deliver 18 satellites for SDA's Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program, bringing total contract value awarded to Rocket Lab by SDA to more than $1.3 billion. Spire Global, Inc. (NYSE: SPIR) has been awarded a contract for the Missile Defense Agency Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense SHIELD indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with a ceiling of $151 billion. This contract encompasses a broad range of work areas enabling rapid delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter with increased speed and agility through Spire's fully deployed satellite constellation and expanding multi-band RF capabilities. "Spire's fully deployed constellation and expanding multi-band RF capabilities are delivering the kind of timely, actionable intelligence that today's defense missions demand," said Quintin Jones, Vice President and Head of North America at Spire Global, Inc. "We're excited for the opportunity this creates to bring our space-based sensing, rapid data delivery, and sovereign-ready solutions to more national security partners and are committed to empowering U.S. and allied forces to operate with greater awareness, precision, and resilience in an increasingly contested world." Through its multipurpose satellite constellation, Spire captures and analyzes radio frequency signals, delivering defense-grade intelligence that strengthens situational awareness for U.S. and allied partners. The company's RF data is processed through secure, cloud-based infrastructure and is available in sovereign-ready configurations for customers requiring full control over mission infrastructure. Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: IRDM) has been awarded a 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract from United States Space Force's Space Systems Command Commercial Space Office with a potential value of up to $85.8 million. The System Infrastructure Transformation and Hybridization contract enables technological refreshes, lifecycle upgrades, and security enhancements to the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services Service Center, Technical Support Center, and Defense Ground Station as a follow-on contract to the Gateway Evolution Contract awarded to Iridium in 2019. The Iridium network provides resilient, mission-critical communications that warfighters need anywhere in the world, even under adverse weather conditions, with SITH representing the latest of three core EMSS contracts between Iridium and the USSF. "Through this contract, Iridium and the U.S. Space Force will continue to innovate and deliver resilient, secure and highly reliable mission-critical communications," said Scott Scheimreif, executive vice president, Iridium. "Our solutions with the Department of Defense are designed to serve every layer of the warfighter's P.A.C.E. plan.

Twenty twenty-five was a year when everything changed – yet, somehow, nothing did. The US raised tariffs to their highest level in almost a century, China retaliated and global policy uncertainty intensified. And still, global growth is projected at 3.2 per cent, exactly what forecasters expected a year earlier when none of this turbulence was on the horizon. It would be a mistake, however, to think the global economy is unaffected by tariff fights and policy chaos. We have seen this movie before. When the Brexit referendum passed, despite the sharp increase in uncertainty, the economic impact was initially minimal. But a decade later, the UK is estimated to have lost between 6 to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) relative to its pre-Brexit trajectory. The lesson is simple: structural damage reveals itself slowly, and always too late to be reversed. So why hasn’t the world felt the sting of tariffs yet? The answer lies partly in actual tariffs being around half of what the US announced thanks to numerous exemptions. Yet at 14 per cent this remains a sharp escalation, the consequences of which had two offsets. First, AI spending and the stock market surge powered by artificial intelligence (AI) optimism have propped up US growth and buoyed economies such as Taiwan and South Korea that export AI-related goods. Second, fiscal policy has been more expansionary, not only in the US, but even more so in Germany and China. These forces masked the drag from American tariffs and Chinese retaliation. They also made 2025 look far more stable than it actually was. [ Six economic flashpoints to watch out for in 2026Opens in new window ] The global economy is more fragile than headline numbers suggest, starting with the fragility in the AI sector. Investors have finally begun to question the gap between sky-high AI valuations and actual AI returns. Companies such as Meta, which have signalled large increases in AI spending without corresponding revenue streams, have been punished. And they are not alone. AI companies will soon have to confront a harsh challenge: prompts cost money, which means subscriptions will need to rise. A price of $20 (€17.12) a month won’t cover the prompt-costs or sustain the infrastructure arms race against new challengers. This is not a statement about AI’s potential, which is in all likelihood transformative. It is a statement about profitability. With competitive pressure both seen and unseen, the risk of a dotcom-style correction is real. Meanwhile, the celebrated “resilience” to tariffs is deeply misleading. Tariffs have been costly, and especially so for Americans. Roughly 95 per cent of tariff costs have been absorbed by US firms, with only some passed on to consumers. That “some” matters: tariffs alone have added 0.7 percentage points to inflation. Without them, inflation could have been 2 per cent this year – exactly the Federal Reserve’s target. Instead, tariffs have made the typical US household $600 poorer. The damage from tariffs will grow more visible in 2026 as the resilience afforded by front-loaded imports fades and companies pass through a higher share of costs to consumers. China also needs to face up to some uncomfortable truths. Continued reliance on export-led growth is untenable, and Beijing’s new five-year plan, which prioritises allocating resources to technology sectors over shoring up social safety nets and boosting consumption, risks deepening structural imbalances. Europe, for its part, has played the adult in the room by defending a rules-based global system, but it still needs to pursue internal reforms on its own account. The EU must deepen its single market, raise productivity and position itself as an attractive destination for global capital seeking diversification. And the US is not helping. Unfriending the European Union – its largest economic partner – is poor economic strategy. While nothing catastrophic happens overnight, Europeans are trying quietly and gradually to decouple from US financial infrastructure, as they question their reliance on Visa and Mastercard. Just a year ago this would have been unthinkable. The reality is that 2025 was a year when everything changed. The question now is whether 2026 will be the year we correct course. There is an opportunity: the US holds the G20 presidency and France the G7 presidency. Together they can spur action to restore stability to an uncertain and increasingly fragmented global system. If we fail to act, living standards everywhere will decline and the inward-looking policies that command popular support today will become unpopular. But by then it may be too late. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 Gita Gopinath is the Gregory and Ania Coffey professor of economics at Harvard University and formerly first deputy managing director and chief economist of the IMF Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Xbox in 2026 — What to expect from Team Green this year, and beyond

It's an interesting, and potentially pivotal year for Xbox in 2026. After a somewhat unprecedented year of negative headlines, Xbox has an opportunity to turn it around this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's Xbox's 25th anniversary this year, and it's starting on a bit of a sour note for many. And really, it shouldn't be. Xbox had a fantastic 2025 on paper. Xbox first party shipped more games than ever. Xbox Game Pass arguably had its best sprint of high-quality games ever too, with Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Oblivion Remake, and many more hitting the service. We also saw a huge Xbox partnership with ASUS for the Xbox Ally gaming handheld, which puts Xbox Play Anywhere at the forefront. Microsoft also announced a big partnership with AMD for next-gen consoles ... alas. That's not what Xbox's 2025 will be remembered for, sadly. Microsoft has been working overtime to sink its image, injecting AI slop into every product it has, laying off thousands while bragging about how much of its code is written by AI, and hiking prices of products to uncomfortable levels. Xbox Game Pass picked up a 50% price hike on the highest tier, and Xbox Series X|S hardware has become prohibitively expensive, leading to free-fall sales declines. The drama led to a barrage of headlines questioning whether or not Xbox would even still exist to see its big 25th anniversary, slated for November 15, 2026. I suspect Xbox will want to put the negativity of the past year firmly behind itself, but it finds itself in a confluence of challenges both internal and external. The storm will pass for the vast majority of Xbox gamers unnoticed most likely, but for the wider audience, Xbox remains firmly under a microscope. One thing we know for certain is what to expect from Microsoft's first party in 2026. At least generally speaking. Microsoft has a lot in the chamber it can fire off potentially in the coming months, but the headliners are set: Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, Halo Campaign Evolved, and Forza Horizon 6. Microsoft often jokingly refers to the line-up as the "four horsemen" internally, representing what are arguably the four most iconic Xbox franchises. Microsoft will show off at least some of these at the January Xbox Developer_Direct show, which has become an annualized tone-setting event for Xbox's yearly line-up. While I'm not sure exactly what will be shown there this year (yet), it seems the four pillar franchises seem highly likely — although I have heard one of Microsoft's more intrepid teams may be ready to show off what it has been baking. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told this is not the case. However, we are eventually getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top. I'm told Obsidian of Grounded, The Outer Worlds, and Fallout New Vegas fame has four new projects, some big some small — Fallout co-creator Tim Cain also joined the studio a short while ago. I'm not sure if any of these projects are Fallout-related, but either way, it shows Xbox isn't taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to content. On the topic of Fallout, we are of course also eventually getting Fallout 5, which I understand to be greenlit. Bethesda's Todd Howard noted in a previous interview that Fallout is receiving a ton of investment right now. It could be a while before we see the fruits of that labor — but perhaps we could see them teased at an upcoming show. After all, 2026 marks several major "anniversaries" for Xbox and some of its subsidiaries. Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, Blizzard is having its 35th, and Bethesda is having its 40th. Microsoft and its teams are planning a variety of events and announcements to celebrate these milestones. At Blizzcon 2026, I thoroughly expect to see new expansions revealed for Diablo IV, alongside World of Warcraft's "The Last Titan." We should also get major updates for Overwatch and Hearthstone, and potentially other new mobile game reveals. There has been long-held rumors of an Overwatch mobile game on the horizon, for example, and I've heard another Warcraft mobile game project is in gestation. The headline for Blizzcon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back. For Bethesda's 40th, could we catch a glimpse at id Software's next title? It has been rumored for an incredibly long time that id could return to Quake or Hexen, now that all the rights fully exist within the Microsoft umbrella. Machine Games' is also thought to be working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title, although I've heard that Wolfenstein III is also on the cards to coincide with the upcoming Wolfenstein Amazon TV show. Perhaps some of these games will break cover at Bethesda's Quakecon event, but big reveals are often reserved for the Xbox Showcase. As usual, Xbox will hold an event in June to coincide with Summer Game Fest and the post-E3 summer marketing blitz. It's here where we should see glimpses at 2027 titles, which could include games like inXile's Clockwork Revolution, Undead Labs' State of Decay 3, Arkane's Blade, and perhaps other hitherto unknown titles. I've heard Ninja Theory's next game will be more combat-involved and interactive than Hellblade 1 and 2, while retaining the cinematic excellence the studio has come to be known for. We'll also catch a glimpse of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 undoubtedly here, with Activision eager to reconnect with fans after Black Ops 7's controversial delivery. Call of Duty will also drop onto Nintendo Switch 2 this year as well, fulfilling Microsoft's promises to regulators. There are strong rumors that Age of Empires will return with a new title in the future too, powered by Unreal Engine. And we could see more of Hideo Kojima's mysterious "OD" horror project this year. There's also plenty of unknowns. Xbox Publishing still has plenty of secret projects. Xbox's large stable of service games will doubtless get major updates this year, including Minecraft, Grounded 2, Fallout 76, Elder Scrolls Online, and the King mobile franchises. Could we see Toys for Bob's long-rumored Spyro this year? What is the mysterious and oft-overlooked Elsewhere Entertainment Xbox team working on? Perhaps we'll find out in 2026. I already wrote an article detailing what the Xbox Ally update roadmap looks like in 2026, but we should see some of those new features sooner, rather than later. Even if you're not an Xbox Ally owner, you should probably keep an eye on how development there is going — the Xbox Ally experience is essentially the next-gen Xbox experience too. I reported last year that the next Xbox will run full bore Windows, and that is still the plan. In partnership with AMD, the next Xbox will utilize the Windows 11 "Full Screen Experience" with the Xbox PC app to deliver its console interface. Microsoft is working on major updates to the Xbox PC app to accommodate this, bringing it more closely in line with what Xbox console players will expect when engaging with a device on their TV, rather than at their desk. Where it diverges with a traditional PC is in its ability to actually run games compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Microsoft announced that it's partnering with AMD to enable Xbox games on this PC-like device. Existing Xbox console users' libraries will come forward with them to the new Xbox, as Microsoft continues to commit to backward compatibility in a big way. I suspect we'll hear more at GDC 2026 about how Xbox plans to modernize its publishing practices to accommodate this new more "open" strategy. Developers shipping on Xbox PC already enjoy a more generous cut of the revenue than they do on console, but Microsoft still has a huge issue getting developers to organically support Xbox PC. Moving the platform to console will help here, but there will at least be a few years where Xbox Series X|S remains the primary development platform for most, I suspect. Microsoft has already signalled that it plans to make Xbox publishing more open and Steam-like, lifting the NDA on some of its publishing rules last year. Microsoft still has a long way to go to improve discoverability for quality Xbox games on its PC store, though. The more "open" nature of the Microsoft Store results in mountains of shovelware hitting the platform, and discovering quality titles remains oddly difficult. Improved community tools such as reviews, comments, curation, and interactivity would help improve discoverability algorithms, so hopefully we see some of those kinds of features materialize this year. I'm told we should also see some new Xbox hardware this year. I suspect we'll finally see the Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 break cover in 2026, and perhaps even other controller revisions. I'm told Microsoft's next-generation Xbox controllers all support direct-to-WiFi connectivity, eliminating Bluetooth latency from cloud gaming scenarios. There's always the chance we'll see more "Xbox" branded OEM hardware, taking advantage of the Xbox Full Screen Experience on Windows, similar to the Xbox Ally. I've been working through some credible rumors that we could see an OEM "Xbox" PC in 2026, but time will tell whether or not that one pans out. On paper, everything is looking up for Xbox as an entity, but challenges remain. Xbox Series X|S hardware sales are in free-fall decline, although existing users are sticky and remain heavily engaged. Despite PlayStation's vastly bigger install base, some games such as Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders over-index on Xbox systems, delivering disproportionate engagement for publishers. There's still a ton of money to be made on the Xbox ecosystem, which is why we haven't seen publishers pull out of the platform despite the decreased amount of new users coming in. Where Xbox is seeing success is on Xbox PC. I'm told Microsoft may begin reporting its Xbox PC stats as part of Microsoft's quarterlies, reflecting its growth. The addition of benefits in games like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant has helped Xbox PC win itself an alternative audience to that of Steam, although organic support still seems to be a challenge for titles shipping outside of Xbox Game Pass. People will continue to view Microsoft under a microscope, and for good reason. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has not been shy about the company's awkward obsession with AI technology, regardless of how well it actually performs for the end-user. "Microslop" has been trending as a result. There have already been rumors of mass Microsoft layoffs in January 2026, although I'm told these are false (at least with regards to Xbox). The DRAM price glut is something Microsoft and other companies will not be able to escape, though. Practically anything powered by a computer is likely to see price increases this year, as OpenAI and other companies buy up all the components chasing increasingly-insane compute demands. Will that further impact prices for console, PC, and even game prices? Xbox won't be the only one impacted by this macroeconomic instability, but Xbox's reputation has already been on shaky ground. There has been a ton of negativity and angst about Microsoft's direction and corporate-level commitment to gaming, and for good reason. But, I am hopeful that Xbox can fully turn a corner this year and begin to show that it, and its ecosystem, are truly here to stay.

Title: Billionaires Start 2026 With Huge Insider Buys

Investing Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX) have just seen some huge insider purchases. However, there were some other notable insider purchases as well. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Brandon Bell / Getty Images News via Getty Images The so-called Warren Buffett of Canada and a prominent American billionaire investor and financial analyst started the year with huge insider purchases. Some of the most prominent buying that has been reported so far this year were from return trips to build stakes in Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX). Though these were the most prominent insider purchases, there were a handful of other notable ones as well. Let’s take a quick look at these transactions. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is especially so during times of market uncertainty, and even when markets are near all-time highs. The fourth-quarter earnings-reporting season is yet to begin, so few insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This buyer, led by billionaire V. Prem Watsa, sometimes called the Warren Buffett of Canada, also scooped up $70 million worth of shares prior to this purchase. The stake is now up to more than 41.9 million shares, and the investment helped boost the stock still suffering after the brand parted ways with spokesperson Steph Curry. Shares were last seen trading for more than the purchase price range above. The stock is still more than 23% lower than six months ago. Given the Wall Street consensus target of $6.07, the analysts anticipate 8.2% upside in the next 12 months. However, only five of 26 analysts recommend buying shares. Guggenheim initiated coverage recently with a Buy rating with a $6 price target. Watsa, founder and CEO of Fairfax, maintains a controlling interest in the company but reportedly is stepping back from some roles to plan for succession. Last spring, this buyer reached an agreement to acquire 15% of W.R. Berkley’s shares. Mitsui Sumitomo expects to complete its investment in this Connecticut-based insurance holding company during the first quarter of 2026. Its stake is up to more than 50.7 million shares, or over 13%. The share price was last seen within the buyer’s latest purchase price range. Yet, the stock is 2.6% lower than six months ago because of recent volatility due to profit-taking. But note that shares are up 20.2% year over year, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time. Analysts are cautious, with only four out of 18 of them recommending buying shares. The mean price target of $73.06 is 3.2% higher than the current price but less than the recent all-time high of $78.96. Mitsui Sumitomo is a massive Japanese financial conglomerate. Note that it also recently acquired an 18% stake in MassMutual’s Barings. This purchase followed on a 100,000-share buy reported at the end of last month. Gabelli also acquired shares of Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE: GDV) and Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (NYSE: GAB) in December. Note that another beneficial owner also picked up some shares of Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust earlier in the month. Shares were last seen trading for less than the $10 purchase price. They have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year but are 4.2% higher than 90 days ago. In addition, Gabelli also boosted his stake in Florida-based electronic equipment and components maker LGL Group Inc. (NYSE: LGL) in late December. These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week. Here is a quick look at some others. Some smaller insider buying was reported at CME, Gitlab, Joby Aviation, SAIC, and Simon Property as well.

Title: What CFO pay packages reveal about long-term strategy
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/what-cfo-pay-packages-reveal-about-long-term-strategy/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T13:06:17Z

Good morning. Executive pay packages are increasingly being reengineered around explicit, measurable performance targets, sometimes including stock price gains. Take Christy Schwartz, who became Opendoor’s CFO on Jan. 1 after serving as interim CFO, chief accounting officer, and VP of corporate control. Her initial base salary is $1.2 million through May 15, then drops to $500,000 annually, plus a $100,000 sign-on bonus. But the larger story lies in her long-term incentives. Schwartz received about 1.7 million performance-based stock units, which vest only if Opendoor shares reach $9, $13, $17, $21, $25, $29, or $33 over a 30-day period between April 2026 and October 2030, according to an SEC filing. This ties a substantial portion of her pay directly to the company’s stock performance over several years—a clear reflection of a broader trend toward performance-driven compensation across Opendoor’s leadership. Riot Platforms is taking a similar approach but with a focus on its evolving business model from a pure-play bitcoin miner into a broader power-and-infrastructure company focused on AI and high-performance computing data centers. There was an update in the pay program disclosed alongside the company’s Jan. 2 announcement that it promoted Jason Chung to CFO, effective March 1.Riot recalibrated its 2026 pay program to better align with the company’s strategic priorities, shifting away from bitcoin-centric compensation. SEC filings reveal that once Riot secures a data center tenant, executive incentives will focus on revenue and net operating income tied to those operations. Specifically, “Data Center Revenue” and “Data Center NOI” will each account for 15% of the annual incentive plan, with payouts ranging from zero to 200% depending on results. At the same time, the adjusted EBITDA metric will drop to 25% weighting. Riot didn’t respond to a request for a comment. In connection with his promotion, Chung’s annual base salary rose to $550,000 from $500,000. Meanwhile, CEO Jason Les and Executive Chairman Benjamin Yi will see base salaries increase to $900,000 from $600,000, eliminating the portion previously paid in bitcoin. Their target bonus opportunities under the annual incentive plan also increased to 125% of base salary from 100%, and their employment agreements were extended through Jan. 10, 2031. Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of executive search firm Cowen Partners, told me that Les’s base salary increase “functions as a buffer against variability in incentive compensation, particularly if performance-based payouts are reduced or less certain.”Aligning executive incentives with company performance and long-term shareholder value can be an effective approach, Cole said. However, he cautioned that it can also create unintended consequences in some cases. The same structures can encourage risk avoidance when missing targets carries immediate downside, while potential rewards are delayed or capped, he added. This is particularly relevant in evolving sectors such as AI, where strategic investments are becoming essential for sustainable growth, but accurately gauging how long they will take to generate financial returns is challenging. As Opendoor, Riot, and other companies recalibrate executive pay, the trend toward tying compensation to long-term performance is clear. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Jeffrey Lee was appointed EVP and CFO of ProAmpac, a flexible packaging and material science company, effective Feb. 9. Lee succeeds Eric Bradford, who has served as ProAmpac’s CFO since 2012. Lee joins ProAmpac from Cornerstone Building Brands, where he served as EVP and CFO for more than six years. Before Cornerstone, Lee was SVP and CFO of Wilsonart International, and EVP and Corporate CFO of Contech. Jean-Frédéric Viret was appointed CFO of SpyGlass Pharma, a late-stage biopharmaceutical company. Viret brings over two decades of corporate finance experience. His most recent roles include serving as CFO of NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Blade Therapeutics, Inc. Before Blade, Viret was CFO at Coherus BioSciences, Inc., now Coherus Oncology. Provident Bank has released the results of its annual “Economic Outlook Survey.” While business owners remain mindful of inflation and trade tensions, there are plans for active expansion and investment for 2026, according to the bank. Over 50% of respondents believe the U.S. economy will be in a better position this year, and over 60% expect their own business to be in better shape. Seventy percent of businesses plan to increase capital expenditures in 2026, up from 68% last year. The number of businesses planning a “significant increase” rose from 11% last year to 19% this year. The survey finds that younger leaders are driving the optimism, with 44% of Gen Z owners expecting their business to be in “much better shape” next year, compared to just 14.5% of Boomers. And 58% of businesses are either already using or planning to adopt AI tools this year, an increase from 41% in last year’s survey. The findings are based on a survey of 1,000 business owners and senior executives in the U.S. working for companies with over $1 million in annual revenue. "How JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon notched $770 million in gains for his work in 2025" is a Fortune article by Amanda Gerut. Gerut writes: "Last year was a roller coaster ride, but a market rebound has pushed mega banks’ stock growth nearly 30% and record compensation and bonuses are likely to follow. Leading the charge is JPMorgan Chase CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon, one of the last sitting Wall Street leaders to have navigated the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent passage of the Dodd-Frank reform act, and now the AI boom. Dimon has spent the past 20 years atop JPMorgan and is known for rarely cashing in his stock." You can read the complete article here. "If you’re tech-savvy, you use a password manager that generates strong and secure passwords that are saved in the cloud. But have you heard of or used a passkey?" —Rishi Bhargava, co-founder at Descope, writes in a Fortune opinion piece that most people have probably been using the same password for their online accounts and apps for years. However, passkeys are not yet widely used. “Tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all benefited from instituting passkeys, and industry associations have pushed to make passkeys the standard,” he writes.

Investing Stocks rallied for the second straight day, as the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 both print new all-time highs. Positive economic and single-stock news, along with anticipation of strong fourth-quarter earnings, helped drive stocks higher on Tuesday. With technology still being the wind in the markets’ sails, we could see more new all-time highs as the week rolls on. Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com The futures are trading flat on Wednesday after a second strong day for Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high, closing over $49,000 for the first time at $49,484, up a solid 1.04%. The S&P 500 also posted a record high, closing at 6,947, up 0.66%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also scored a win on Tuesday, closing the day at 23,546, up 0.64%. Continued momentum from Monday carried stocks higher, plus solid economic news on multiple fronts also added to the bullish sentiment. Semiconductor stocks are still leading the technology charge, and many feel the top companies could post outstanding fourth-quarter earnings, which will start next week with the big money-center banks reporting. Plus, after hitting a wall at the end of 2025, AI and data center stocks have shown renewed momentum as investors chase more big gains in 2026. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve after a solid start to the week on Monday. While buying was seen in the shorter T-bill maturities, there was some modest selling across the middle and longer maturities. Investors are clearly focused on upcoming economic data and geopolitical events, such as developments in Venezuela. However, recent market shifts saw yields dip amid broader Fed uncertainty and tech bubble fears, creating a volatile environment for safe-haven assets. The 30-year long bond was last seen Tuesday at 4.85% while the benchmark ten-year note finished the day at 4.17% After a solid Monday, stocks were down across the energy complex, and some of the same worries from 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday as expectations of a global supply surplus in 2026 and the lack of immediate supply disruption from geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, as Chevron reported that it will keep Venezuelan oil flowing despite the political upheaval there. Traders are focused on market fundamentals, which point to ample supply and subdued demand concerns. Brent Crude closed at $60.49, down 2.06%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.91, down 2.42%. Natural gas also saw sellers reappear, as unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country was a factor. Nat gas closed at $3.40, down 3.43%. Gold and Silver continued their respective marches higher, albeit not as dramatically for Gold as some of the trading days we have seen recently, when both precious metals would bolt higher by 5-10% and more. The song remains the same as central bank buying, massive retail inflows, and geopolitical concerns continue to drive investors to chase both Gold and Silver. Gold closed the session up almost 1% at $4,492. However, Silver continued a hot streak, closing up 6.06% at $81.18. Crypto markets traded mixed on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin pulled back slightly but generally held above the $91,000 to $92,000 range, while some altcoins like XRP and Solana posted notable gains. Many crypto analysts on Wall Street are starting to signal they feel the bottom after a sizable sell-off that began last year may be in the process of being put in. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $91,940, while Ethereum was trading at $3,212. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Title: Tech companies may only get half the profit they need to justify AI investment, Goldman analyst warns

The S&P 500 hit a new record high yesterday, up 0.62% at 6,944.82. Futures are marginally down this morning, as might be expected from traders who want to sell up and lock in some of those gains. The STOXX Europe 600 also hit a new high yesterday and was flat in early trading this morning.Much of the bullishness is coming as analysts realize that the massive amounts of capital expenditure (capex) on building out AI data centers isn’t likely to stop anytime soon.The result of all that new spending will be that “we expect another year of solid gains for U.S. equities in 2026. We forecast an S&P 500 total return of 12% to a year-end level of 7,600,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider and his colleagues told clients in a note sent this morning.However, the wrinkle for 2026 will be that AI capex growth will start to slow down, he said. In turn, the amount of profit needed to justify all that capex won’t show up, Snider et al argue, and that will cause traders to pick and choose winners and losers among the big tech firms of the S&P 500. “The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 account for 41% of market cap and drove 53% of the S&P 500 2025 return. We expect AI spending will exceed consensus estimates this year but begin to decelerate in growth terms while corporate adoption increases, causing rotations among the largest U.S. tech stocks that create two-way risk for the aggregate index,” he told clients. Capex spending by the big “hyperscalers” (Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) was roughly $400 billion in 2025, up 70% annually, Goldman calculates. The big tech companies have also started to fund much of that growth with debt. “As spending and debt grow, so do the necessary eventual profits to justify ongoing investments,” Snider says. So far, tech companies have been happy to spend that money because the profits they generated were two or three times as much as they invested, Goldman estimates. The problem is that that might be unsustainable, Snider says. “Given consensus estimates for an annual average of $500 billion in capex from 2025-2027, maintaining the returns on capital to which their investors have become accustomed would require these companies to realize an annual profit run-rate of over $1 trillion, more than double the 2026 consensus estimate of $450 billion in income,” he wrote. While some of these companies will successfully generate the profits they need, others won’t, he says. “The magnitudes of current spending and market caps alongside increasing competition within the group suggest a diminishing probability that all of today’s market leaders generate enough long-term profits to sufficiently reward today’s investors.” Analysts at Vanguard and Piper Sandler are also focused on the AI-capex-profit story. Piper chief global economist Nancy R. Lazar and her colleagues anticipate that tech companies have not yet reached the ceiling of their capex budgets, especially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) grants new tax breaks on companies’ capital spending. “Tech capex has been a huge story for a while now, but against history, it’s still not ‘too high’ vs. GDP. And there’s plenty of upside ahead, given OBBA’s full capex expensing, Fed easing, and banks easing lending standards,” they told clients. Vanguard’s Qian Wang, global head of capital market research, also warned that if profits don’t follow capex then investors should expect a downturn. “We are bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy. But transformative technology needs profitable business models to win. And, in the financial markets, returns hinge on expectations. Tech companies’ earnings have been strong so far, but their valuations may have gotten ahead of themselves. When expectations get too far out of whack, it is not surprising to see markets pull back,” she said in an email sent to Fortune. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Title: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for Apple — one that could shape CEO Tim Cook's legacy

Tim Cook has built a reputation as a steady stalwart of Apple during his nearly 15-year tenure as CEO. His next — and potentially final — chapter at the tech giant could be his most defining yet. This year is shaping up to be a big one for Apple and the 65-year-old CEO, whose eventual retirement is a topic of much speculation in the tech industry. His company is planning a long-delayed update to its virtual assistant, Siri, to solidify its standing in artificial intelligence, and tech analysts expect the next major iPhone innovation to be a highly anticipated foldable model. Cook took over for Apple's late founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Since then, he has led the company through innovative product launches, turbulent times, and financial highs. Under Cook's leadership, Apple has woven together an ecosystem of interconnected products and services that shaped how consumers interact with the company. The iPhone may be its cash cow, but its services business — which Cook expanded to include AppleTV, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music — and smart accessories like the Apple Watch help keep the company relevant. "Tim Cook's greatest accomplishments are the financial evolution of the company, the integration of Apple silicon, and maintaining the iPhone's dominant walled garden ecosystem," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told Business Insider. Still, Cook's greatest challenges may lie ahead as he navigates political changes, greater competition from tech rivals, and an AI arms race that could leave Apple behind. After a turbulent 2025, Cook is navigating the aftershocks of major changes to US policies, Apple's supply chain, and the global smartphone market landscape. The year 2025 was marked by a new high for Apple's stock as the company reached a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time in October. However, it also faced economic headwinds in the form of tariffs and stiff competition abroad. China remains a challenge for Apple, with revenue in the region down 4% in its most recent quarter, though Cook said on the October earnings call that he expects the new iPhone 17 lineup to drive a return to growth in the region. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei are gaining popularity with local smartphone users. A major America-first shift in trade policy under President Donald Trump also prompted Apple to rethink its supply chain. It rapidly shifted some iPhones to India last year and pledged to invest hundreds of billions more in the US in the coming years. Still, China remains a significant manufacturing hub for Apple, and the US-China trade war could continue to impact the company. "So far, Cook has walked that political tightrope with considerable dexterity, but the high degree of economic policy uncertainty and volatility will require him to continue steering the ship with an even hand," Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider. One of Cook's biggest challenges ahead will be cementing Apple's positioning in artificial intelligence, an area where the company appears to have fallen behind its rivals, analysts tell Business Insider. It's not just the launches of Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, that have to be successful. It's also about the way Cook is integrating the technology into Apple's operations. "AI has redefined what legacy means," Martha Heller, CEO of Heller, a specialized technology executive search firm, told Business Insider. Ten years ago, "the goal was to leave a solid foundation so the next leader could create change intentionally without chaos," she said. Now, it's up to leaders to create an AI road map — from the nitty-gritty of products to the mindset of the board — to take a company into the future. Cook has been praised for his steady leadership, but his strategy will have to be turned up a notch if he doesn't want to be caught flat-footed in the age of rapid change. Heller said Cook has made "partial progress" in his performance under the new AI-driven standards that CEOs must consider. "Cook has laid the foundation for Apple's AI future, but the next 12 to 18 months will determine whether reinvention becomes his defining legacy," Heller said. Of course, while competitors are investing billions into their AI ventures, Apple's more modest approach could pay off in the end, as investors closely scrutinize how much Big Tech companies are spending on AI and the return on investment. Apple's AI push has so far failed to fuel the iPhone upgrade super cycle that some analysts, like Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, predicted the iPhone 16 family would bring. The jury is still out on the iPhone 17's overall performance, but Cook said he expected the December quarter would be the "best" yet for iPhone sales. Like other tech companies, Apple also faces the challenge of holding onto its top talent to drive future innovation. In 2025, it lost several AI researchers who left to pursue opportunities at rival tech companies, such as Meta. The company is also coming up against device competition from its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who is teaming up with OpenAI to create an AI gadget. With an AI arms race in full swing and competitors releasing innovative takes on the smartphone, such as foldable models, the pressure is on Apple to act faster than it has recently. "While Cook has kept Apple's growth trajectory moving forward at a steady clip, he has not overseen a step-change innovation that resets Apple's competitive position for the next two decades, as Jobs did with the iPhone," Chatterjee said. The Vision Pro, released in February 2024, failed to gain traction among the masses at a $3,500 price point and lacked a killer app to differentiate it from other headsets. The long-rumored Apple Car, which held potential to be a tenure-defining product for Cook, is widely believed to be scrapped. However, Apple Watch and AirPods have become essential pieces of tech for many Apple users. In 2020, Apple's former CFO Luca Maestri likened the revenue of the wearables segment to that of a Fortune 140 business. But with innovations to the iPhone feeling increasingly incremental over the last decade, 2026 could be the year when Apple's much-needed reset finally arrives, as competitors continue to encroach on its competitive edge at the forefront of innovation. A new and improved Siri is expected to arrive this year, following a few delays. Although Apple hasn't confirmed, supply chain analysts and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have predicted a foldable iPhone could come as early as this fall. If so, it would be in line with Apple's "not first, but best" strategy of not being the first to market a product but to try to do it better than its competitors. Cook hasn't publicly revealed his succession plan, but that hasn't stopped tech industry watchers from speculating on who will replace him and when. The Financial Times recently reported that Cook has intensified his search for a successor. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The year 2025 brought about meaningful leadership changes at Apple. John Giannandrea was the senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy at Apple before announcing his plans to retire in the spring of 2026. Cook's longtime No. 2, Jeff Williams, retired last year. Cook has said in the past that he prefers an internal successor and that he is grooming "several" executives as potential replacements. Bloomberg in October identified John Ternus, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, as "the most likely heir apparent." Whoever ends up stepping in for Cook will be closely examined for their technical background. Unlike Jobs, Cook is famously "not a product guy" — Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson as much. A candidate from a hardware background, like Ternus, could excite Apple's fan base — and investors. Finding his replacement will undoubtedly shape Cook's legacy at Apple. He's spent nearly 15 years building it, seeing the company through several wins and missteps. "Cook's legacy, upon his departure, will be defined by steady and disciplined operational stewardship — proof that a company can be more than just exciting and visionary; it can also be enormously valuable to all its stakeholders," Chatterjee said.

Title: TV chef on his train station row over a toastie, weight loss drugs and why you're using salt wrong

Great British Menu winner Tommy Banks tells the Money blog about the "political decisions" hurting hospitality in our monthly Cheap Eats feature. Wednesday 7 January 2026 18:52, UK Every month we interview top chefs from around the UK, hearing about their cheap food hacks, views on the industry and more. This week, we speak to Great British Menu winner, Michelin-starred chef and restaurateur Tommy Banks. When I was growing up my mum and dad ran a bed and breakfast... It did mean that every day was basically breakfast service in our house. Everything was just to a fine art and I probably didn't realise at the time, but it definitely had an influence on me. Because it was on a farm, my dad would collect the eggs every morning and then he would crack them all on to saucers. Then he would grade them on look and quality, and then he would decide which ones to use for each job. So only the ones in his A grade would get poached, and then it would be fried, and then scrambled would be the lowest grade. When the family took over the (now Michelin-starred) Black Swan in North Yorkshire, I was 17... I did one year of A-levels, was politely asked not to come back for a second year and started working. It was very much make it up as you go along and figure it out. But that's nearly 20 years ago now. Follow the latest consumer news here Everyone lowered prices during the 2008 crash, but we put them up... The crash was really tough on many industries, but hospitality in particular is one of the first things that suffers when people don't have money. What we noticed was that everybody was doing cheap deals, two-for-ones, all this sort of thing was the rage at the time. But realistically, you don't travel into the middle of nowhere for a bargain. So we actually put our prices up and we tried to make it more of an experience rather than just doing what everyone else did. That's easier said than done when you've got no idea what you're doing as a 21-year-old, but I think it was a sound strategy. It is probably quite an interesting strategy for today's market as well. It can be a race to the bottom if you're not careful. I won a Michelin star when I was very young and didn't have it all figured out at all. I had huge imposter syndrome... I felt very insecure about my ability and very insecure about the sort of plaudits that were coming my way. You don't really learn anything from someone giving you a compliment, do you? You only learn from mistakes and from going through tough times. I journal every day and it's very rare that I write anything negative about the future... I was really poorly when I was 18. I got ulcerative colitis. My grandfather, whom I was very, very close to, died, and the stress of that caused my body to start eating itself. I was really poorly for about a year. I had a colostomy bag and was in and out of hospital, having three bouts of major surgery. I always wanted to try to turn a negative into a positive and that's certainly what gave me a quite insatiable drive for success. If I'd never been ill, I'd have just dossed around like any other lad my age, getting drunk, playing sport and doing all the other things that you want to do when you're that age. Cheap Eats: 'I'm a head chef - this is what you should tip and one thing I hate that some customers do' Cheap Eats: Top chef on spag bol hack, the Burger King item you can't beat, and two things customers should stop doing Cheap Eats: 'It's just bizarre' - top chef vents about two things customers do in 2025 In a lot of ways, COVID had quite a positive impact... because it definitely encouraged people to be way more creative with their outlooks and more entrepreneurial. I think people diversified their offerings and you see that from the number of people who added their businesses to things like Uber Eats, because they're looking at different ways of getting to the customer. The challenges are clear though... People don't have as much money to spend. There's a clear trend towards less drinking and earlier dining, especially. And it hasn't maybe affected us as much because of our location and what we do. But talking to more casual businesses, especially in London, the invention or the take-up of weight loss drugs has had a massive effect on that area of the market because people are literally eating less. Good for the customer, terrible for the operator... From a consumer point of view, the changes are really good because there's now a more diverse, better-quality hospitality industry. It's terrible for the operator, though, because the margins are tiny and people are going out of business. The biggest effects on the industry have been political choices... Increasing the minimum wage is a good thing for people who can have more money, but increasing the younger level of minimum wage decreases the job prospects of young people. Take the hike to employer national insurance - when you add in what is essentially a tax on jobs, you are going to see many redundancies. The national insurance increase, coupled with the living wage increase last year, added £250,000 to our wage bill. We just used to make really nice food but... the creative skill of the chef now is more how you create something that people really want to buy, but at the price point that they're willing to pay, while still having a margin. It's a nearly impossible thing. Most businesses are operating at break-even or below. Fish costs have gone up astronomically... One of my signature dishes is a turbot dish, which I did on Great British Menu many years ago. And when we had it on the menu in 2017, we would pay £18 a kilo for the whole fish. When I wanted to buy the turbot about a month ago, it was £86 a kilo. An operational change that I've made is going to sound really basic but... actually just better reporting, measuring everything. Every point of a percentage actually really matters in an industry that's operating at break-even.

What I would do, though, is give businesses 10% off the first 10% that they turn over and then businesses are incentivised to increase their turnover because they get a tax break. If you want to encourage growth, you would incentivise them financially? Why do they not do that? All they do is just tax us again. I was waiting for a train the other day at York Station and there was a little independent selling coffee... and they had a cheese and ham toastie for £7. I heard someone just be like, "£7 for a toastie?" I was like, "It's not seven quid though, is it?" Just take off the VAT as the starting point, and think about how much it costs to rent in the station. People don't consider the overheads and the costs of running something. Everything is so instant now... You can do everything on your phone, AI does half the stuff for us. But there's something old school about hospitality. Something about human interaction and breaking bread and spending that time together that just cannot be replaced with technology. And I think that's what still excites me. I just don't think it'll ever go out of fashion to spend time with loved ones and enjoy great hospitality and human interaction. Why can't we celebrate this? The most memorable customer I've had was a very famous American chef... called Thomas Keller, who has several three-Michelin-starred restaurants in America. And he came for dinner at the Black Swan. It was quite a few years ago now, but obviously everyone was so nervous. It was probably the most important chef in the world coming for dinner. He came in and the first thing he did is fist-bump everyone and ask if he could go into the kitchen. He asked "How you doing guys?" I just thought, "Wow, what a way to put everybody at ease." A behind-the-scenes moment from Great British Menu that viewers don't get to see is... how challenging it is to operate at that sort of level day after day, after day, after day, over a filming day that can be 14 or 15 hours. When your adrenaline is that high, it actually gets to the point where it's a real case of stamina. And I think sometimes people watch the show and go, "God, that person just fell apart when it came to the judges", and that might be because they're absolutely spent and exhausted. The standards have got higher and higher and higher every year on Great British Menu... One chef who probably stands out above all would be Spencer Metzger. He really nailed Great British Menu. People who do well practise and practise and practise and practise. One technique to make cheap products taste even better is... knowing how to use salt. It would make a massive difference to a lot of people's food. That sounds awful. A lot of people will cook without any salt and then add it at the end. But salt is a chemical you need to add throughout the cooking process. That's how you achieve the depth of flavour and an overall feeling of being seasoned. If you add salt at the end, food will taste bland and salty. Because you just taste the salt. There are quite a few cheat codes that work quite well... if I'm trying to cook quickly and cheaply, I will use things like Worcester sauce or Marmite, which are really umami, but they're really cheap. If I were trying to make something really quickly and not spend loads of money on expensive beef stock and things like that, a little spoonful of Marmite and a little bit of Worcester sauce would really increase the seasoning without really adding much cost to the dish. We spoke to Tommy Banks following the launch of his Classic British menu, available exclusively on Uber Eats this past December in London, Manchester, and Liverpool. The menu reimagined dishes from the last 400 years, celebrating tradition with a refreshingly contemporary touch.

Register by Jan 13 to save on passes and connect with marketers from Uber, Bose and more This Future of TV Briefing covers the latest in streaming and TV for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at the trends and developments that will shape the TV, streaming and digital video industry in 2026. No one knows how 2026 will play out. But many of the major developments this year are likely to be ripple effects precipitating from events of the past year. Here are five in particular that are most likely to dominate storylines and strategies across the TV, streaming and digital video industry in 2026. Netflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio business won’t close in 2026. But that’s unlikely to put a hold on M&A activity among major TV and streaming companies. The first question becomes what do WBD’s spurned suitors do in response? Paramount and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are unlikely to pair up given the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s broadcast ownership rules (and the U.S. government’s antagonistic relationship toward Comcast). But there are (much) smaller targets on the market: A+E Global Media, AMC Networks, Lionsgate, Starz, etc. Then there’s the much bigger question of how does Disney react? And the clarifying question — with Disney CEO Bob Iger slated to step down in 2026 — of who will oversee Disney’s reaction? Or does Disney become an acquisition target because Netflix’s attempt to acquire WBD has jolted its tech counterparts, namely Amazon and Apple, to bolster their respective streaming libraries with owned-and-operated intellectual property (and does Disney’s content licensing deal with OpenAI influence or de-influence that)? In 2025 Youtube cemented its status as the predominant media company on TV as a whole, not just streaming. The Google-owned video platform had already overtaken Netflix as the most-watched streaming service on TV screens in the U.S., and last year it leapfrogged Disney as the most-watched TV network and/or streaming service owner on TV screens in the U.S. But for as much as YouTube has propelled itself into a class of its own, it began facing new forms of competition in 2025. Netflix and Tubi, for example, inked deals with top YouTube creators to distribute the creators’ YouTube libraries on their respective streamers. They also signed deals with creators for original series, and Netflix started to go after YouTube’s video podcasting preeminence by securing exclusive distribution deals for some shows that also include pulling those shows away from YouTube. In other words, YouTube’s growth has reached a point of maturation for the creator economy. That intersection is pushing the platform’s TV and streaming competition to take its creators more seriously, and this year that may press YouTube to respond in ways that refortify its position at the center of the creator economy. Last year streaming’s share of advertisers’ annual upfront commitments inched closer to traditional TV’s portion. This year may be the one when the balance finally tips in streaming’s favor. To be clear, the overall TV ad market already tips in streaming’s favor outside the upfront. But the upfront has continued to orient around TV, if only by virtue of it really centering around live sports. But on that front, the conditions in this year’s upfront are likely to be different than last’s. This year’s upfront comes a year after ESPN and Fox introduced standalone streaming services as well as after Amazon and Peacock began airing NBA games. Also in this year’s upfront Netflix will have Major League Baseball and the Women’s World Cup on offer. And then there’s the biggest asterisk of all: when it comes to the upfront, to what extent is YouTube taken into account? I guess the other asterisk is to what extent does the upfront even matter anymore. It does matter, but not to every advertiser, especially those who can’t afford or don’t care for traditional TV inventory. Consider that ad-supported tiers growing and streaming services and connected TV platforms creating more inventory in the form of home-screen ads and increased ad loads. As a result, streaming ad prices are dropping, which will likely induce more demand for streaming inventory — especially as more of that major live sports streaming inventory is made available for sale programmatically outside the confines of an upfront agreement. On the other end of the industry spectrum is the short-form video market, and at the center of that market for years has been TikTok. But this year there will be TikTok and then TikTok U.S. Sure, legacy TikTok (i.e. ByteDance) will reportedly still be responsible for ad sales, but TikTok U.S. will effectively be a separate app — and potentially a new user experience. The look of TikTok U.S. may mirror its legacy version, but the feel will come down to its U.S. operators’ ability to replicate its content recommendation algorithm, as well as to people’s willingness to continue to use the app under its new owners. Another factor will be moves made by TikTok’s primary rivals. We’ve spent enough space talking about YouTube, but there remains the major fact that last year YouTube said Shorts generated more revenue per watch time than long-form videos, meaning YouTube has every incentive to ramp up its TikTok rival in 2026. And then there’s Instagram Reels. The Meta-owned platform’s CTV app may end up in the dustbin alongside IGTV, but it’s hard to ignore Reels’ $50 billion annual revenue run rate, especially if Instagram (and Facebook) start sharing that ad revenue with creators and publishers. The impact of AI-generated content on short-form video platforms is too big to squeeze into the previous section. Plus it’s not limited to short-form video platforms, nor is it simply a question of slop. Last year saw AI-generated video passing the “Will Smith eating spaghetti” test and receiving its own dedicated video platforms in the form of OpenAI’s Sora and Meta’s Vibes. AI-generated video can’t be confined to its own feeds, though. A sizable share of YouTube Shorts’s feeds are already being populated with AI-generated videos, as noted below in “Numbers to know.” And an increasing number of brands from Coca-Cola to Equinox are rolling out AI-generated ads. TikTok and Pinterest have introduced options to limit AI-generated content in feeds, but neither platform makes any promises about being able to entirely wipe AI-generated content from those feeds. Instagram’s Adam Mosseri seemed to acknowledge as much by saying in a recent Instagram post that “it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.” And that’s at a time when the line between real and fake media is becoming even blurrier in light of Disney’s OpenAI deal and the likelihood of more major IP owners following suit. Meanwhile, Disney is looking to incorporate AI-generated video into Disney+, and the most popular streamer on Twitch is powered by AI. For as pervasive as AI-generated video has become, so too has been the pushback against it. But there’s no pushing back the clock to a time before generative AI. While Netflix-WBD may further signal TV and streaming cycling back to the bundle, AI slop portends a new era altogether. That all this is happening at the same time only makes the outlook fuzzier. Now to see how it all comes into focus throughout the year. “If the user experience holds steady, we expect spend to fluctuate only as media buyers pause to recalibrate their data.” 30%: Estimated percentage share of Netflix’s subscriber base that is the ad-supported tier. 700 million: Number of hours that YouTube viewers, cumulatively, spent streaming podcasts through the platform’s CTV app in October. 21%: Percentage share of 500 YouTube Shorts in a sampled feed that were AI-generated videos. 26.5 million: Number of U.K. streaming subscribers who are on ad-supported tiers, versus 23.1 million who on ad-free tiers. 18%: Percentage increase in the number of layoffs for employees in the entertainment and media industry in 2025.

Instagram’s CTV play: Instagram is hoping people will want to stream short-form, vertical videos on their horizontal TV screens through its new CTV app, according to Bloomberg. YouTube’s podcast advertising impact: More and more people are tuning into podcasts through YouTube, but host-read podcast ads on YouTube aren’t as likely to lead to product purchases as host-read podcast ads in audio-only podcast platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Title: Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends Shareholders Reject Amended Paramount Tender Offer

WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS SHAREHOLDERS REJECT AMENDED PARAMOUNT TENDER OFFER Offer Remains Inferior to Netflix Merger Agreement Across Numerous Key Areas Value is Insufficient Given Significant Costs, Risks and Uncertainties Heightened Risk of Failure to Close Compared to Netflix Combination Significant Potential Consequences for Shareholders if PSKY Offer Fails to Close NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors The basis for the Board's decision is set forth in Amendment No. 3 to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Offer Remains Inferior to Netflix Merger Agreement Across Numerous Key Areas Value is Insufficient Given Significant Costs, Risks and Uncertainties Heightened Risk of Failure to Close Compared to Netflix Combination Significant Potential Consequences for Shareholders if PSKY Offer Fails to Close NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors The basis for the Board's decision is set forth in Amendment No. 3 to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Value is Insufficient Given Significant Costs, Risks and Uncertainties Heightened Risk of Failure to Close Compared to Netflix Combination Significant Potential Consequences for Shareholders if PSKY Offer Fails to Close NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Heightened Risk of Failure to Close Compared to Netflix Combination Significant Potential Consequences for Shareholders if PSKY Offer Fails to Close NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Significant Potential Consequences for Shareholders if PSKY Offer Fails to Close NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2026 -- Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. ("Warner Bros. Discovery" or "WBD") (NASDAQ: WBD) today announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously determined that Paramount Skydance's ("PSKY") (NASDAQ: PSKY) tender offer, as amended on December 22, 2025, is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a "Superior Proposal" under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, Inc. ("Netflix") (NASDAQ: NFLX) announced on December 5, 2025. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. The Board unanimously reiterates its recommendation in support of the Netflix combination and recommends that WBD shareholders reject PSKY's offer. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. "The Board unanimously determined that the Paramount's latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas," said Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. "Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed. Our binding agreement with Netflix will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders." In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. In connection with its determination, today the Board sent a letter to WBD shareholders providing detail on its recommendation. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Full text of the letter follows below. Dear Fellow Shareholders, As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors The basis for the Board's decision is set forth in Amendment No. 3 to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations.

WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY.

Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. As you know, at the end of last year, your Board of Directors concluded its process to maximize shareholder value by entering into our merger agreement with Netflix. Since then, Paramount Skydance ("PSKY"), a bidder in that process, has commenced a hostile tender offer to acquire WBD, which it recently amended on December 22, 2025. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer. For a full discussion of the reasons for the Board's recommendation, we urge you to read the full Schedule 14D-9 filing, including the amendment filed today. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. As described further below, your Board unanimously determined that the PSKY amended offer remains inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide, the lack of certainty in PSKY's ability to complete the offer and the risks and costs borne by WBD shareholders should PSKY fail to complete the offer. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders not tender your shares into the PSKY offer.

WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY.

Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. PSKY Offer's Insufficient Value PSKY's offer is inferior given significant costs, risks and uncertainties as compared to the Netflix merger. Under the Netflix merger agreement, WBD shareholders will receive significant value with $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50 based on a collar range in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing, which has future value creation potential. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments.

The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Additionally, WBD shareholders will receive value through their ownership in Discovery Global, which will have considerable scale, a diverse global footprint, and leading sports and news assets, as well as the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue its own growth initiatives and value-creation opportunities. The Board also considered the costs and loss of value for WBD shareholders associated with accepting the PSKY offer. WBD would be obligated to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee for abandoning our existing merger agreement; incur a $1.5 billion fee for failing to complete our debt exchange, which we could not execute under the PSKY offer without PSKY's consent; and incur incremental interest expense of approximately $350 million. The total cost to WBD would be approximately $4.7 billion, or $1.79 per share. These costs would, in effect, lower the net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD from $5.8 billion to $1.1 billion in the event of a failed transaction with PSKY. In comparison, the Netflix transaction imposes none of these costs on WBD. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so.

The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Lack of Certainty in PSKY's Ability to Close the Transaction The extraordinary amount of debt financing, as well as other terms of the PSKY offer, heighten the risk of failure to close, particularly when compared to the certainty of the Netflix merger. PSKY is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization. To effect the transaction, it intends to incur an extraordinary amount of incremental debt - more than $50 billion - through arrangements with multiple financing partners. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing.

These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. The transaction PSKY is proposing is in effect a leveraged buyout ("LBO"). In fact, it would be the largest LBO in history with $87 billion of total pro forma gross debt and an estimated gross leverage of approximately 7x 2026E EBITDA before synergies. The WBD Board considered that an LBO structure introduces risks given the acquiror's reliance on the ability and willingness of its lenders to provide funds at close. Changes in the performance or financial condition of either the target or acquiror, as well as changes in the industry or financing landscapes, could jeopardize these financing arrangements. Many prior large LBOs illustrate that acquirors or their equity and/or debt financing sources can, and do, seek to assert failures of closing conditions in order to terminate a transaction or renegotiate transaction terms. This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger. The risks inherent in the LBO structure are exacerbated by the amount of debt PSKY must incur, its current financial position and future prospects, as well as the lengthy period to close the transaction - which PSKY itself estimates to be 12-18 months following signing. PSKY already has a "junk" credit rating and it has negative free cash flows with a high degree of dependency on its legacy linear business. Certain fixed obligations that PSKY has incurred or may incur prior to closing, such as the multi-year programming and sports licensing deals, could further strain its financial condition. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing.

In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Further, the operating restrictions between signing and closing imposed on WBD by the PSKY offer could damage our business, allowing PSKY to abandon the offer. The onerous covenants include, among others, restricting WBD's ability to modify, renew or terminate affiliation agreements. These restrictions may hamper WBD's ability to perform and could lead PSKY to assert that WBD has suffered a "material adverse effect," enabling PSKY and its financing partners to terminate the transaction or renegotiate the terms of the transaction. In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026. The merger agreement with Netflix also provides WBD with more flexibility to operate in a normal course until closing. Given these factors, the Board determined that the Netflix merger remains superior to PSKY's amended offer. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros.

Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Consequences for WBD Shareholders Should PSKY Fail to Close the Transaction If PSKY fails to close its offer, WBD shareholders would incur significant costs and potentially considerable value destruction. In addition to potentially enabling PSKY to abandon or amend its offer, the operating restrictions that PSKY would impose on WBD between signing and closing could impair WBD's financial condition and ability to maintain its competitive position in the markets in which it operates, and hinder its ability to retain key talent. This includes prohibiting WBD from pursuing the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros., which was designed to derisk our businesses by allowing each to focus on its own strategic plan. The PSKY offer would also prevent WBD from completing the contemplated debt exchange and refinancing our $15 billion bridge loan without PSKY's consent, which would limit our financial flexibility. If the PSKY offer fails to close, WBD shareholders would be left with shares in a business that has been restricted from pursuing its key initiatives for up to 18 months. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Further, WBD shareholders would receive insufficient compensation for the damage to our businesses should the PSKY offer not close. The $1.1 billion net amount of the regulatory termination fee that PSKY would pay to WBD represents an unacceptably low 1.4% of the transaction equity value and would not come close to helping WBD address the likely damage to our businesses. In contrast, should Netflix fail to complete the merger for regulatory reasons, WBD would receive a $5.8 billion termination fee and WBD shareholders would still benefit from the initiatives that the Board and management team are implementing to secure the value of our businesses and ensure their long-term success, including the planned separation of Discovery Global and Warner Bros. The PSKY Offer Is Not Superior, or Even Comparable, to the Netflix Merger PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions. The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY and its representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its "best and final" proposal. PSKY's transaction team, including many of their employees, several law firms, investment and lending banks and consultants, had several months to engage extensively with WBD. They are well aware of the reasons behind the Board's determination that the Netflix merger agreement is superior to its offer. If on December 4 PSKY did not recognize the weaknesses of its proposal when the Board concluded the process, it has now had several weeks to study the Netflix merger agreement and adjust its offer accordingly. Instead PSKY has, for whatever reason, chosen not to do so. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Your Board negotiated a merger with Netflix that maximizes value while mitigating downside risks, and we unanimously believe the Netflix merger is in your best interest. We are focused on advancing the Netflix merger to deliver its compelling value to you. Sincerely, The Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. The basis for the Board's decision is set forth in Amendment No. 3 to the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Warner Bros.

Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations.

Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This communication includes financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), such as total pro forma gross debt, gross leverage and free cash flow, which WBD's management believes is useful information for investors and WBD stockholders to evaluate the financial condition of a combined PSKY-WBD company and the Netflix merger, as applicable. Total pro forma gross debt is calculated as the sum of (i) total debt plus finance leases of WBD, (ii) total debt of PSKY, (iii) adjustments to provide 50% equity credit for PSKY's junior subordinated debt and (iv) new financing in connection with PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer. Gross leverage is calculated as gross debt of WBD and PSKY divided by total EBITDA of WBD and PSKY, based on (i) Wall Street consensus estimates of PSKY and WBD EBITDA and free cash flow metrics, (ii) PSKY's proposed transaction terms in the PSKY offer, (iii) WBD management's forecasts and (iv) certain other adjustments. WBD is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP forward-looking measures to comparable GAAP measures as, at this time, WBD cannot determine the occurrence or impact of the adjustments, such as the effects of any future synergies from a potential transaction that would be excluded from such GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP forward-looking measures are based on information obtained from Wall Street equity research analysts. Accordingly, WBD is relying on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K to exclude these reconciliations. Forward-Looking Statements Information set forth in this communication, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction between WBD and Netflix, constitute forward-looking statements. These estimates and statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. Such estimates and statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the proposed transaction, including future financial and operating results, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements about the tender offer and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of WBD and Netflix and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the completion of the proposed transaction may not occur on the anticipated terms and timing or at all; (2) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the proposed transaction; (3) the risk that WBD stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction; (4) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (5) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed transaction may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (6) the final allocation of indebtedness between WBD and Discovery Global in connection with the separation could cause a reduction to the consideration for the proposed transaction; (7) risks related to potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed transaction; (8) the risk that the integration of the businesses will be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected; (9) risks related to financial community and rating agency perceptions of each of WBD and Netflix and their businesses, operations, financial conditions and the industries in which they operate; (10) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; (11) failure to realize the benefits expected from the proposed transaction; (12) effects of the announcement, pendency or completion of the proposed transaction on the ability of WBD and Netflix to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers, and on their operating results and businesses generally; (13) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (14) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of WBD and/or Netflix common stock; (15) risks relating to the value of the shares of Netflix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction and uncertainty as to the long-term value of Netflix common stock; (16) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Netflix's operations after the consummation of the proposed transaction, and on the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; (17) risks related to the potential impact of general economic, political and market factors on the companies or the proposed transaction; (18) the risk that Discovery Global, as a new company that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms; (19) the risk that Discovery Global may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that WBD expects Discovery Global to achieve as an independent, publicly-traded company; (20) the risk that Discovery Global may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while still a part of WBD; (21) the risk that Discovery Global will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the separation, and the degree to which it will be leveraged following completion of the separation may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; (22) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the proposed transaction or the separation upon acceptable terms or at all; (23) uncertainties as to how many WBD stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; (24) the conditions to the completion of the tender offer, including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals; (25) PSKY's ability to finance the tender offer and the indebtedness PSKY expects to incur in connection with the tender offer; (26) the possibility that PSKY may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate PSKY's operations with those of PSKY, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the tender offer; and (27) the response of WBD, Netflix or PSKY management to any of the aforementioned factors. Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in WBD's and Netflix's filings with the SEC, including their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and will be contained in the Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, to be filed by Netflix in connection with the proposed transaction and the registration statement to be filed by Discovery Global in connection with the separation. Neither WBD nor Netflix is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
