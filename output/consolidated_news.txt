Ian Curran has the story relating to Ingram Homes where the broadcaster and former Fine Gael minister is listed as a director and which is behind a large-scale housing scheme in Midleton, Co Cork. It understood to be replacing BPH Construction after it entered receivership this week. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was on a plane when Donald Trump unleashed his “Liberation Day” trade upheaval. Did he catch any of the live press conference? No, he tells Joe Brennan in an extensive interview, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t got a lot to say about it. Not long after Trump’s tariff U-turn, of sorts, the European Union (EU) moved to pause its retaliatory measures in the hope of building some goodwill. “We took note of the announcement by president Trump. We want to give negotiations a chance,” commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Nevertheless, as Jack Power reports from Brussels, uncertainty remains. Or as EU commissioner for industrial policy Stéphane Séjourné says, the “only certainty is that instability will remain for the next four years”. Meanwhile, it emerged that US tariffs levelled against China have now, in their entirety, reached 145 per cent. Denis Staunton is reporting from Beijing on the response there where officials say they are open to dialogue but only absent of threats. “China’s position is clear and consistent,” said spokesman He Yongqian, “…our door remains open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect.” Meanwhile, Arthur Beesley has a comprehensive explainer on everything that has happened, for now at least, and why. It’s hard to keep up with tariff news, given just how prone Donald Trump is to changing his mind. Not to mention the markets. There has been much made of what it all might mean for Ireland, given our close ties to US multinationals. In his column, John FitzGerald has a think about what the best responses might be from an EU point of view, and what the manufacturing of iPhones in Asia might mean for our coffers here. Much like tariffs, Dublin Airport’s efforts to lift its passenger cap rumbles on, although with little sign of imminent change. Peter Flanagan reports that there will be no restriction on slots for carriers this winter, with an ongoing legal challenge keeping the cap on hold. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has cleared additional slots for the upcoming winter season. US technology giant Workday has completed the deal to locate its new European HQ to College Square, the mammoth office scheme developed by Marlet Property Group on the old site of Apollo House in Dublin 2. The agreement, first reported on by The Irish Times, is a substantial office deal, and gives Workday’s staff the equivalent of five and a half football pitches. An Irish payroll manager who admitted “spying” on his own firm has escaped punishment for contempt of court. Keith O’Brien had faced the possibility of going to jail for contempt after destroying a phone he had been ordered to preserve. Rippling, a US-headquartered software provider brought High Court proceedings against its former employee claiming he had passed trade secrets to rival company Deel. Latest data shows headline inflation in the Irish economy reached to 2 per cent in March, for the first time since July 2024. That was up from an annualised inflation rate of 1.8 per cent. Ian Curran crunches the numbers which show restaurants, hotels and housing made the largest contribution.

The unseasonably cold snap blasting much of North America is delaying the spring DIY sales boost toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker typically enjoys about this time of year. But the Connecticut-based maker of power screwdrivers to lawnmowers felt a harsher chill from Washington last week when Donald Trump unleashed tariffs on the rest of the world. Stanley Black & Decker may be better able to deal with the rapidly escalating trade war between the US and China than it would have been under Trump’s first presidency. “Seven, eight years ago, about 40 per cent of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we’re down to a number that’s closer to the mid-teens,” chief executive Don Allan told analysts on a call in January. It didn’t stop the company’s shares sliding 29 per cent over the course of 4½ days of trading following Trump’s April 2nd ‘Liberation Day’ speech. It made the toolmaker one of the worst affected stocks on the S&P 500 index as a violent wider market reaction wiped trillions off the value of shares globally and triggered gyrations across other financial markets. That was before the US president sensationally announced during lunchtime trading in New York on Wednesday (just after 6pm Irish time) that he would be putting a 90-day pause on most tariffs. Even though he has doubled down on China – levies on imports from there would rise to 125 per cent from 104 per cent after Beijing unveiled additional retaliatory charges earlier in the day – Stanley Black & Decker would not be denied participating in the biggest one-day Wall Street rebound since October 2008, jumping 15 per cent as the wider US market soared 9.5 per cent. [ White House says tariffs on China now total 145%Opens in new window ] While the relief rally spilled over into Asia and Europe on Thursday, selling pressure resumed as trading got under way again on Wall Street as markets waited for Trump’s next move. The market reaction seen for most of the past 10 days was “very different to anything we’d seen before”, said Aidan Donnelly, head of equities at Davy Private Clients. “Unlike, say, the financial crisis or Covid, this was self-inflicted.” Elliot Hentov, head of macro policy research at State Street Global Advisors, said stocks “would now require another positive trigger to take another leg up, while policy uncertainty continues to dominate market moves in coming weeks”. “The residual unknown would relate to whether US-China trade relations could improve within a reasonable time frame,” he said. The about-turn proved that Trump pays attention to the markets. But while the S&P 500 is usually the 78-year-old’s barometer of choice, it was the bond market that forced him to blink first in his game of chicken with what he had called “foreign scavengers”. Investors had initially piled into US government bonds – a traditional safe haven in times of market volatility – in the immediate aftermath of last week’s tariffs speech, sending the market interest rate – or yield – on its 10-year notes from about 4.2 per cent to below 4 per cent. However, the yield – which drives not only government borrowing costs but influences rates on new mortgages, credit card debt and business loans – spiked in the first three days of this week to as high as 4.5 per cent. This was an unusual move at a time when recession fears are mounting. It triggered a number of theories, ranging from investors dashing for cash to hedge funds being forced to sell to meet margin calls, and speculation that Chinese and Japanese investors – among the largest holders of US debt and worst impacted by Trump’s protectionist measures – were dumping US government bonds. Trump, who vowed over the weekend to maintain his hard line against the country’s trading partners even after stocks tanked, acknowledged on Wednesday evening the flashpoint that had spooked him most. [ US tariffs: Why Trump U-turned on his bombastic tariffs and what it means for IrelandOpens in new window ] “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it,” he told reporters. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.” His government needs to refinance trillions of dollars of debt in the next 12 months. The announcement of the 90-day moratorium suggests markets can probably eliminate worst-case scenarios, according to Barry Glavin, the Dublin-based head of global equities at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. “However, it also means that uncertainty will continue throughout this period,” he said. “It remains unclear what a steady-state looks like in terms of the tariff regime the US will stick with. It also remains to be seen what retaliatory measures will be implemented.” Trump’s major reversal will see tariffs on nations that don’t retaliate against the US drop to 10 per cent, which aligns with his blanket tariff level on all imports. Before this, most imports from the EU were facing a 20 per cent charge. EU member states had only approved 25 per cent counter-tariffs on a wide range of US products earlier on Wednesday, including poultry, soyabeans and steel. These were suspended on Thursday. The seven days that followed Trump whipping out his tariffs chart in the White House Rose Garden saw shares globally – measured by the MSCI World Index – slumping more than 11 per cent and Wall Street’s gauge of market fear, the Vix index, spiking at levels last seen five years ago during the height of the Covid panic. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off in Ireland – with Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB sliding between 14 and 18 per cent, amid concerns about the fallout on Ireland’s open economy. Only hours before his volte-face, Trump was threatening to soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which make up 60 per cent of Irish goods shipments across the Atlantic. In Dublin, too, the Central Bank upped its surveillance of Irish-domiciled funds holding €4.9 trillion of assets, making it the second-largest funds hub in Europe. [ EU hits pause on counter-tariffs in hope of US trade dealOpens in new window ] “Approximately €2.1 billion, or circa 43 per cent, of the total net assets of Irish domiciled investment funds are invested in global equities. The Central Bank has been closely monitoring data flows and engaging directly with various market participants in recent days, as is standard at times of heightened market volatility,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said. “We cannot comment on individual firms or the specifics of our supervisory engagements, but we continue to monitor for indicators of stress.” Over the seven days, the price of crude oil plunged by more than a fifth to less than $56 a barrel on recession fears; gold, a traditional go-to for investors in times of uncertainty, hit an all-time high of almost $3,168 an ounce before falling almost 7 per cent; and the premium that investors demand to hold debt of companies with low credit ratings, or junk bonds, spiralled at their fastest pace, relative to government debt, since the US regional banking crisis in March 2023. The cost of investors insuring against companies and sovereigns defaulting on debt on the credit default swaps market also moved higher. The turbulence was compounded by mixed messaging on the ultimate aim of the tariffs regime, with Trump and his treasury secretary Scott Bessent suggesting it would yield trade deals, while his top adviser on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, insisted there was no room for negotiation. Dissent also crept into the upper echelons of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. Elon Musk, head of Tesla and SpaceX, and Trump sidekick, distanced himself from the plan over the weekend when he suggested the US should enter a free-trade zone with Europe. He subsequently entered into a bitter public spat with Navarro, calling the protectionist former economics professor “a moron”. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a vocal backer of Trump’s presidential bid last year, urged the president to pause the tariffs, or risk “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Ken Fisher, founder of Fisher Investments and a longtime Trump supporter since the 2016 campaign, went even further. He took to X on Tuesday to say the tariffs were “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools”. What Trump unveiled Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish. Musk and the other six CEOs of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies that had led the wider market higher in recent years – including Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, all flag wavers at Trump’s inauguration in January – saw tens of billions wiped off their combined net wealth as the values of their companies fell. “Speedy ‘deal’ announcements over the coming 4-6 weeks would be the most favourable (or least negative) outcome for equity markets, in our view, and remain our base case,” said Deutsche Bank equity strategists, led by Maximilian Uleer, in a report published even before Trump announced his U-turn. If the US had stuck to the tariffs announced last week, Deutsche reckons it would have shaved as much as 1.5 percentage points off US gross domestic product (GDP) expansion this year – suggesting the economy would barely grow. It would only have been a matter of time before equity markets priced in a potential recession in Europe, too, they said. There is a threat that the US will return to its original tariffs plan once the 90-day pause is over, even though Trump – who sees himself as the ultimate dealmaker – has significantly weakened his hand by caving in to market forces. For now, a unilateral 10 per cent charge on most imports remains. “Right now, we don’t know who will pay for them,” said Ipek Ozkardeskava, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. “Will exporters absorb the majority of the costs to protect their US market share? Or will exporters pass on the costs to US consumers?” Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from US companies as the first-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday with banking giants JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and investment group BlackRock reporting results and hosting analyst calls. While Davy’s Donnelly says market volatility may be the order of the day for the near term, he notes that investors with a long-term perspective have historically been well rewarded. The MSCI World Index’s 13 per cent decline so far this year compares to an almost 19 per cent advance over the course of 2024. The index is up by about 50 per cent from where it stood at the end of 2019. “In that period we’ve had a global pandemic, a massive swing in global interest rates and a trade dispute, and yet equities are up sharply,” said Donnelly. “If you were to be shown a chart in five years’ time depicting the performance of the stock market over 10 years, you probably wouldn’t be able to pick out [the current episode].” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How will US President Trump and Russia's Putin shape Germany foreign policy?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/german-social-democrats-and-conservatives-to-form-coalition-amid-global-chaos/a-72209474
Time Published: 2025-04-11T04:56:00Z
Full Content:
Germany's Social Democrats and Conservatives are eager to form a coalition amid the global economic and political uncertainty. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have announced a coalition agreement, bringing Germany that much closer to forming a new government. It appears international friction and the recent tariff policies imposed by US President Donald Trump pushed negotiators to reach an agreement sooner, rather than later. Presenting the new agreement on Wednesday, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, likely to become the country's next chancellor, said Germany was currently facing a "situation of growing geopolitical tensions." The response of the coalition-in-waiting to these uncertain times, he said, was that "we want to, and we will, help shape change in the world, for Germany." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the SPD, added that "this is a turning point. We are living in truly historic times." When the new government takes office, expected it early May, it will be facing several important challenges on the world stage. Trump's steep import tariffs and the countermeasures some affected countries have adopted in retaliation have sent global stock markets into a downward spiral and sparked fears of a global trade war. As an export-driven nation, these tariffs have hit Germany particularly hard — and even more so given that its economy has been in recession for more than two years. The European Union manages trans-Atlantic trade, so Germany cannot act independently in this matter. That's why, in light of its economic vulnerability, the incoming German government is hoping to deescalate. The coalition agreement states that Germany will aim for "a medium-term free trade deal with the United States," while in the short term, "the coalition parties aim to avoid a trade conflict with the US and focus on reducing import tariffs," on both sides of the Atlantic. Given Trump's recent series of economic about-faces, this approach might prove a bit too optimistic. Merz has long been a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations. He chaired Atlantik-Brücke, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fostering US-German relations, for 10 years. And while he's never actually lived in the United States, he does say that the years he spent working for the US-based global investment firm BlackRock made him very familiar with the US mindset. However, ever since Trump retook the White House for a second term, it would appear Merz's faith in close trans-Atlantic ties has been shaken. When the US president — falsely — blamed Ukraine for Russia's war of aggression, Merz stated that he was " shocked by Donald Trump." And he was reportedly equally appalled when Trump and his vice president, JD Vance , publicly embarrassed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in late February. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Germany, meanwhile, fell out of Trump's favor years ago, when former Chancellor Angela Merkel was still at the helm. This was not least due to her open refugee policy, which apparently was a thorn in the eye of the US nationalist. But even though Merz has consistently distanced himself from Merkel politically, a personal meeting between him and Trump would likely not be easy. To date, nothing has been planned. Trump's efforts to secure a peace "deal" for Ukraine have relegated European nations to the role of spectators. So far, he has only spoken directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a possible peace framework. Ukraine's Zelenskyy has remained sidelined from discussions. Should an agreement emerge, it's likely to amount to an imposed settlement for Ukraine, and Germany and other EU nations will presumably be left with the task of enforcing it. The incoming coalition appears to want to continue supporting Ukraine. "We stand with the brave Ukrainian people. They can rely on us," said Klingbeil on Wednesday. In reality, the coalition partners have yet to make a final decision on the matter. Until then, it remains unclear how military aid will proceed. While he was still leading the opposition in the previous government under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz advocated for sending Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Scholz consistently opposed the move, fearing it could draw Germany into direct conflict with Russia. On election night in February, Merz admitted he was unsure whether Trump would honor the US' collective defense commitments under NATO's Article 5, should the need arise. That's why, he said, he wanted to strengthen European defense cooperation, "so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US." Merz has already secured parliamentary approval for his famous financial pledge of "whatever it takes" to strengthen the German armed forces. Part of deepening European defense cooperation would mean exploring ways in which Germany and Europe might benefit from the nuclear deterrence offered by the continent's two nuclear powers, France and the UK. That will be no easy feat, given that neither nuclear power is likely to readily share its capabilities. Many other EU nations also hold reservations against deeper military cooperation. And Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban not only maintains close ties with Russia's Putin, he also opposes military aid for Ukraine. In the past, Merz repeatedly accused Scholz's administration of neglecting European ties, especially regarding Germany's relations with its neighbors France and Poland. Now that he's poised to take charge, Merz aims to change this — but there's much to do. Just days after winning the election, Merz visited French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris. But Macron is politically weakened at home. And while Poland might have a pro-European government under former EU Council President Donald Tusk, Berlin does not have a close relationship with Warsaw. Across the EU enthusiasm for deeper integration has waned, with right-wing populist movements steadily rising in many member states. Amid ongoing trade-related friction with Trump, some politicians in Berlin and Brussels are eyeing China as an alternative trade partner. But trade with China is no longer as lucrative as it once was. German car exports, once a major success in China, have seen declining sales. Now, the EU has begun imposing restrictions on Chinese electric vehicles. As an export-oriented country, Germany will likely try to prevent these trade barriers from becoming too high. The future government will also aim to reduce security risks associated with China. In the coalition agreement, the partners have agreed to "effectively prevent foreign investments in critical infrastructure and strategically relevant sectors that conflict with our national interests." This passage is likely directed straight at China. When it comes to relations with Israel, Germany sees itself in a particularly difficult bind. On the one hand, due to Germany's Nazi past and its orchestration of the Holocaust, in which over 6 million Jews and nearly 5 million other people from minority groups were killed, German governments have since seen a historic duty in safeguarding the state of Israel. On the other hand, Israel's ongoing military action in Gaza and the occupied West Bank has drawn some guarded criticism from German politicians as being disproportionate. Israel claims its military campaign in Gaza and the West Bank is to root out the Palestinian nationalist and Islamist movement Hamas. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, overwhelmingly women and children, and displaced more than 80% of the population. The occupied West Bank has also recently seen a spike in violence, with over 700 Palestinians killed in the same time frame. Germany and several other countries designate Hamas as a terrorist organization. In late 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. This puts Germany in a tough spot. As a signatory to the Rome Statute which underpins the ICC, Germany would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu, should he enter Germany. But Merz has already promised that, under his chancellorship, Germany would "find ways and means" for Netanyahu to visit and leave the country unbothered.

Title: How will Trump, Putin shape Germany's foreign policy?

Germany's Social Democrats and Conservatives are eager to form a coalition amid the global economic and political uncertainty. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have announced a coalition agreement, bringing Germany that much closer to forming a new government. It appears international friction and the recent tariff policies imposed by US President Donald Trump pushed negotiators to reach an agreement sooner, rather than later. Presenting the new agreement on Wednesday, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, likely to become the country's next chancellor, said Germany was currently facing a "situation of growing geopolitical tensions." The response of the coalition-in-waiting to these uncertain times, he said, was that "we want to, and we will, help shape change in the world, for Germany." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the SPD, added that "this is a turning point. We are living in truly historic times." When the new government takes office, expected it early May, it will be facing several important challenges on the world stage. Trump's steep import tariffs and the countermeasures some affected countries have adopted in retaliation have sent global stock markets into a downward spiral and sparked fears of a global trade war. As an export-driven nation, these tariffs have hit Germany particularly hard — and even more so given that its economy has been in recession for more than two years. The European Union manages trans-Atlantic trade, so Germany cannot act independently in this matter. That's why, in light of its economic vulnerability, the incoming German government is hoping to deescalate. The coalition agreement states that Germany will aim for "a medium-term free trade deal with the United States," while in the short term, "the coalition parties aim to avoid a trade conflict with the US and focus on reducing import tariffs," on both sides of the Atlantic. Given Trump's recent series of economic about-faces, this approach might prove a bit too optimistic. Merz has long been a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations. He chaired Atlantik-Brücke, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fostering US-German relations, for 10 years. And while he's never actually lived in the United States, he does say that the years he spent working for the US-based global investment firm BlackRock made him very familiar with the US mindset. However, ever since Trump retook the White House for a second term, it would appear Merz's faith in close trans-Atlantic ties has been shaken. When the US president — falsely — blamed Ukraine for Russia's war of aggression, Merz stated that he was " shocked by Donald Trump." And he was reportedly equally appalled when Trump and his vice president, JD Vance , publicly embarrassed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in late February. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Germany, meanwhile, fell out of Trump's favor years ago, when former Chancellor Angela Merkel was still at the helm. This was not least due to her open refugee policy, which apparently was a thorn in the eye of the US nationalist. But even though Merz has consistently distanced himself from Merkel politically, a personal meeting between him and Trump would likely not be easy. To date, nothing has been planned. Trump's efforts to secure a peace "deal" for Ukraine have relegated European nations to the role of spectators. So far, he has only spoken directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a possible peace framework. Ukraine's Zelenskyy has remained sidelined from discussions. Should an agreement emerge, it's likely to amount to an imposed settlement for Ukraine, and Germany and other EU nations will presumably be left with the task of enforcing it. The incoming coalition appears to want to continue supporting Ukraine. "We stand with the brave Ukrainian people. They can rely on us," said Klingbeil on Wednesday. In reality, the coalition partners have yet to make a final decision on the matter. Until then, it remains unclear how military aid will proceed. While he was still leading the opposition in the previous government under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz advocated for sending Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Scholz consistently opposed the move, fearing it could draw Germany into direct conflict with Russia. On election night in February, Merz admitted he was unsure whether Trump would honor the US' collective defense commitments under NATO's Article 5, should the need arise. That's why, he said, he wanted to strengthen European defense cooperation, "so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US." Merz has already secured parliamentary approval for his famous financial pledge of "whatever it takes" to strengthen the German armed forces. Part of deepening European defense cooperation would mean exploring ways in which Germany and Europe might benefit from the nuclear deterrence offered by the continent's two nuclear powers, France and the UK. That will be no easy feat, given that neither nuclear power is likely to readily share its capabilities. Many other EU nations also hold reservations against deeper military cooperation. And Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban not only maintains close ties with Russia's Putin, he also opposes military aid for Ukraine. In the past, Merz repeatedly accused Scholz's administration of neglecting European ties, especially regarding Germany's relations with its neighbors France and Poland. Now that he's poised to take charge, Merz aims to change this — but there's much to do. Just days after winning the election, Merz visited French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris. But Macron is politically weakened at home. And while Poland might have a pro-European government under former EU Council President Donald Tusk, Berlin does not have a close relationship with Warsaw. Across the EU enthusiasm for deeper integration has waned, with right-wing populist movements steadily rising in many member states. Amid ongoing trade-related friction with Trump, some politicians in Berlin and Brussels are eyeing China as an alternative trade partner. But trade with China is no longer as lucrative as it once was. German car exports, once a major success in China, have seen declining sales. Now, the EU has begun imposing restrictions on Chinese electric vehicles. As an export-oriented country, Germany will likely try to prevent these trade barriers from becoming too high. The future government will also aim to reduce security risks associated with China. In the coalition agreement, the partners have agreed to "effectively prevent foreign investments in critical infrastructure and strategically relevant sectors that conflict with our national interests." This passage is likely directed straight at China. When it comes to relations with Israel, Germany sees itself in a particularly difficult bind. On the one hand, due to Germany's Nazi past and its orchestration of the Holocaust, in which over 6 million Jews and nearly 5 million other people from minority groups were killed, German governments have since seen a historic duty in safeguarding the state of Israel. On the other hand, Israel's ongoing military action in Gaza and the occupied West Bank has drawn some guarded criticism from German politicians as being disproportionate. Israel claims its military campaign in Gaza and the West Bank is to root out the Palestinian nationalist and Islamist movement Hamas. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, overwhelmingly women and children, and displaced more than 80% of the population. The occupied West Bank has also recently seen a spike in violence, with over 700 Palestinians killed in the same time frame. Germany and several other countries designate Hamas as a terrorist organization. In late 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. This puts Germany in a tough spot. As a signatory to the Rome Statute which underpins the ICC, Germany would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu, should he enter Germany. But Merz has already promised that, under his chancellorship, Germany would "find ways and means" for Netanyahu to visit and leave the country unbothered. At the tail end of the outgoing administration, the Green Party managed to secure significant funding for climate protection and even saw the constitution amended to include the goal of climate neutrality by 2045. But on a global scale, the situation looks much different. Right after taking office, Trump withdrew the US from all international climate agreements.

Title: King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’

Donald Trump’s Liberation Day speech didn’t take long to free the market bears, sparking chaos across global equity and debt markets for days. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was on a flight from Amsterdam to Dublin on his Gulfstream private jet on the evening of April 2nd, when Trump took to the White House Rose Garden to unveil a raft of “reciprocal tariffs” on the rest of the world and railed about how “foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream”. Fink, whose firm’s $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management as of December made it greater than the German, French and Italian economies combined, met me the following morning in the Merrion Hotel, fresh from having delivered a speech at an event held by the State’s Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and a meeting earlier with Taoiseach Micheál Martin. Did he manage to capture any of the speech live? “I didn’t,” he said, adding that while he expected the tariffs to affect the markets for a number of days, “over a year or so, we’ll work it out”. Still, he said he saw the likelihood of a US recession as “not insignificant” over the next few months. In the days following the interview, Fink told the Economic Club of New York that most CEOs he talks to were saying the world’s largest economy is probably already in recession. But the 72-year-old, a lifelong Democrat supporter, was reticent when asked whether he agreed with Trump’s tariff policy, which the president sensationally largely paused on Wednesday for 90 days – except for China – after the sell-off of stocks and US government bonds became too much. “It’s not for me to agree,” Fink said. “But I understand the logic behind it.” “When I think about economic policy post-World War II, so much of the US trade policies were related to lifting more countries throughout the world, knowing that that would be good for the US and US exporters. The world’s changed quite considerably now. Does there need to be asymmetry in trading agreements? How can we make more symmetry between nations? That’s what he said.” [ BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffsOpens in new window ] Fink may have drawn the ire of Republicans in recent years for being seen as a key player in the environment, social and governance (ESG) movement – or, as some would call it, “woke capital” – but his latest annual letter to shareholders, released last week, is more in tune with the sensibilities of a party that now controls the White House and both chambers of the Congress. Those who ran away from the financial crisis here in Ireland, or because of the fear of Brexit and what it means for Ireland, or because of the fear of what Covid meant for Ireland ... they were harmed It omits any reference to climate change, or even diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) – in stark contrast to his 2020 letter in which he famously suggested that “climate risk is investment risk” and was a factor worth evaluating in investment decisions. Trump, meanwhile, personally hailed BlackRock for leading a consortium that agreed last month to buy a ports holding company from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holding for $22.8 billion, which would give the US investment giant control of two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. It came at a time when Trump had been railing against what he saw as China’s influence and control over the crucial canal. Fink rejects the notion that the deal was in any way politically motivated. “If I ever did that, I should be fired. Okay? Fired,” he says. “Our job is to be providing each and every client a fine, long-term investment return. If I ever overlay political concerns or political realities – that I’m doing something for political reasons – then [I] should be fired. It’s not my money.” Much of that money is based in Irish-based funds. Over $1 trillion of BlackRock’s global assets under management are invested in the group’s 550-plus Irish domiciled funds. It opened an office in Dublin, home to one of the world’s largest funds hubs, in 2011, at the height of the financial crisis, and has subsequently grown its headcount to more than 140 employees. He uses Ireland as an example to illustrate how investors should ignore the “noise” of what’s driving financial markets from one week to the next – and how investors should remain focused on the long term. “Everybody’s worried about tariffs at the moment. But the moment doesn’t matter. The biggest problem that I see in the developed world today is all the uncertainty around whether people have adequacy in savings. Can they retire with dignity? That’s not a today problem. If the market goes down 3 per cent today or up 3 per cent today, it doesn’t matter. How do you give people more hope that they can invest over the long run and have a pool of money so they can live in retirement with dignity? “For those who ran away from the financial crisis here in Ireland, or because of the fear of Brexit and what it means for Ireland, or because of the fear of what Covid meant for Ireland ... they were harmed. The most important thing is staying in the market, being optimistic over the long run. Yes, there’s going to be a lot of noise. But for those who remained in the market over the last 15 years, they made a lot of money.” “We’re caught up the ups and downs of markets. We’re caught up in the noise. We’re caught up in the politicisation of everything. But for investors who are focusing on investing for retirement, for the long term, the most important thing is to stay in the market.” While about 60 per cent of Americans are invested in shares or the wider capital markets, only a third of Europeans have such exposure. Fink says the Irish figure is below 20 per cent. There are many reasons, such as the lack of a capital markets union (despite the European Commission pushing for this for the past decade), and the fact that many investors – including hundreds of thousands in Ireland – bear the scars from investing in the privatisation of European telecoms just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. “I think it’s more systematic than that,” says Fink. “I think Europeans tend to be more short-term than Americans. I think it’s a function of having two world wars.” “You could argue that Americans are always too optimistic. But that optimism has created the dynamism of America, it’s created more entrepreneurialism. You have so many young people [in America] who want to start their own companies and believe that they have an opportunity to do that. But that is not as broad here in Europe. “If you don’t take risks, you will never make a return.” He sees his own career as capturing that American spirit. Having graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with a master’s in business administration in 1976, the LA native went to work in the storied Wall Street investment bank First Boston, where he rose over the following decade to become a star mortgage-backed securities trader. However, his department made a disastrous unhedged bet in 1986 on the direction of interest rates, a move that would cost the firm $100 million and mark the beginning of the end of his career with the institution. Fink left First Boston in 1988. The bank let it be known at the time that he was fired. He co-established BlackRock as a bond shop the same year with seven other executives under the umbrella Blackstone, the then fledgling private equity firm. Blackstone was led then, as now, by Steve Schwarzman. “The ashes of my failure at First Bost were the fertiliser, or the foundation, of BlackRock,” says Fink. It taught him the lesson that risk management is absolutely essential. Blackstone exited its BlackRock investment in 1994 following tension between Fink and Schwarzman over employee compensation. BlackRock’s first big break came the same year, when it was hired by US conglomerate General Electric to sell off its then Kidder Peabody stockbroking unit’s portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. It floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999. In 2006, BlackRock bought Merrill Lynch Investment Management. It doubled the group’s assets under management to almost $1 trillion and gave the investment bank a 45.8 per cent stake in the business. BlackRock’s financial solutions advisory business landed a host of gigs advising governments and investment banks around the globe during the financial crisis – starting with playing a key role in helping the Federal Reserve Bank of New York put figures on hard-to-value assets in Bear Stearns as it faltered, paving the way for a government-led rescue and sale of the faltering investment bank to JP Morgan. In Ireland, BlackRock was involved in an assessment of loans in the banks in the wake of the State’s international bailout, to help determine the ultimate size of the black hole on their books – and how much taxpayers would ultimately need to inject into the system to keep it afloat. The final bill came to €64 billion. BlackRock also took advantage of Barclay’s need to boost its capital levels in 2009 by acquiring the UK banking giant’s asset management arm, including its exchange traded funds (ETFs) business, iShares, for about £4 billion (€4.6 billion) and an almost 20 per cent stake in the group. The masterstroke made the business the world’s biggest asset manager and Fink the king of Wall Street. Merrill, now part of Bank of America, and Barclays have long since sold their stakes. Last year, BlackRock went on its biggest deals spree ever, starting off by paying $12.5 billion for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a large infrastructure fund manager whose investments includes data centres, airports, railroads and water and waste management companies. It followed up by buying Preqin, one of the world’s leading data firms in private markets, for $3.2 billion, and spending $12 billion on HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit firm. GIP was a key part of the ports deal agreed last month. In his latest annual letter to shareholders, Fink took aim at the 73-year-old modern investment portfolio strategy developed by Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and William Sharp, which allocates roughly 60 per cent of assets to shares and 40 per cent to bonds. In future, he said, the standard portfolio may look more like 50/30/20 – stocks, bonds and private market assets such as real estate, infrastructure and private credit. “Assets that will define the future – data centres, ports, power grids, the world’s fastest-growing private companies – aren’t available to most investors. They’re in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants,” he wrote. “Private markets don’t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate – and that’s exactly what we’ve spent the past year doing at BlackRock.” The letter also suggests now is the time to be more “bullish about Europe”. It was a conclusion he seems to have come to at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, when he detected a pessimism like never before among delegates about the outlook for the continent, following a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife,” he says. “It was so palpable and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” A political agreement reached in Germany last month to shift from the country’s stringent debt rules after years of underinvestment is a game changer for the EU’s largest economy, he says. It saw the country’s chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz secure backing in parliament to ramp up investment – expected to reach €1 trillion over the next decade – in the country’s infrastructure, green energy and military, justifying the move by pointing to the breakdown of transatlantic relationships, growing geopolitical instability and the need for more defence spending. Fink says that conversations with European CEOs in recent months suggests there has been a broader change in attitude among European leaders and regulators. “They’re starting to focus on a growth agenda,” he says, “not a control agenda.” Name: Larry Fink Job: Chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager Lives: On a farm in North Salem in upstate New York, though he is mainly based on weekdays in his pad in Manhattan.

World Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino looks on as US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signs a bilateral agreement, in Panama City on Apr 9, 2025. (Photo: AFP/Franco Brana) PANAMA CITY: US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP on Thursday (Apr 10), a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities". The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the US broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 per cent of US container traffic and 5 per cent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the US funded, built and controlled until 1999. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force - such as the one the US maintains in Darwin, Australia - could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the US had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable". He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego on Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The US recognised Panama's sovereignty - not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion - and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians. The country has a long and difficult relationship with the US. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal giving access to all nations. But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries - including its two on the Panama Canal - to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal.

India's industrial production growth slows to 2.9% in February 2025, with manufacturing, mining, and power sectors underperforming. .The 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs is seen as a major boost to global sentiment, reducing the risk of a deep U.S. recession and financial market disruption. Emkay expects a rebound in commodity prices and a wave of bilateral trade deals that will limit economic damage. Domestically, the RBI’s easing stance is expected to support a recovery in consumption. While government capex may slow, sectors like power should drive growth. A soft U.S. landing is also a tailwind for Technology, aiding employment and discretionary demand. Emkay maintains its FY26 Nifty EPS estimate at 1,156. Q4FY25 results are mixed—topline growth for Emkay’s universe is muted at 2.1% YoY, with PAT declining 7.2% due to margin compression and a high base in Energy.

Title: Kirby McInerney LLP Urges Investors in Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) to Inquire About Their Rights in Class Action Lawsuit

April 10, 2025 20:00 ET | Source: Kirby McInerney LLP Kirby McInerney LLP NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of those who acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:RKLB) securities during the period from November 12, 2024, through February 25, 2025 (“the Class Period”). Investors have until April 28, 2025, to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Rocket Lab’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab shares declined by $2.21 per share, from $22.49 per share on February 24, 2025, to close at $20.28 on February 25, 2025. The complaint alleges that defendants, throughout the Class Period, failed to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities, have information, or would like to learn more about this investigation, please contact Thomas W.

April 10, 2025 18:46 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law LOS ANGELES, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: Tech stocks give up some of Wednesday’s gains following tariff pause

UPDATED 17:36 EDT / APRIL 10 2025 by Maria Deutscher Numerous tech firms saw their shares tumble during today’s trading session amid a broader sell-off in stocks and cryptocurrency. The declines chipped away at the gains that public markets logged yesterday. According to a CNBC tally, Wednesday saw the heaviest trading volume on record: an estimated 30 billion shares changed hands before the closing bell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 12% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 8%. The Wednesday rally came in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. would temporarily lower tariffs on all countries except China. With certain exceptions, duties will remain at 10% for 90 days. Tariffs on imports from China, in turn, are set to increase sharply. Stocks started giving up some of the Wednesday gains after today’s opening bell as investors digested the impact of the revised duties. The selloff accelerated after the Trump administration clarified that the tariffs on imports from China will be set at 145%, not 125% as investors previously believed. Around noon EDT, 2,562 of the stocks on the NYSE were in the red while only 163 were up. The S&P 500, which tracks leading stocks on not only the NYSE but also other exchanges, experienced a similar decline. About 80% of the companies in the index ended the trading day with their share prices down. Many major tech firms were among the affected stocks. Nvidia Corp. lost nearly 6% of its market cap while Microsoft Corp. closed 2.3% lower than the same time a day earlier. Amazon.com Inc. shares slid 5.1%. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. experienced one of the biggest declines: its stock is down 6.7%. Investors may be concerned that the tariffs on Chinese imports may increase the company’s data center hardware costs. Meta’s advertising business may also be a factor: the Financial Times reported in February that China-based advertisers account for about 10% of the company’s revenue. Apple Inc., which makes most iPhones in China, saw its share price drop more than 4% today. Reuters reported today that the company has flown 600 tons of iPhones to the U.S. from India because it “wanted to beat the tariff.” Apple reportedly convinced local officials to reduce the amount of time its devices take to clear customs at a Chennai airport. Today’s selloff was also felt in the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase Global Inc. shares fell about 6% while the price of Bitcoin is down more than 3%. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, experienced single-digit declines as well. During a Cabinet meeting this afternoon, Trump didn’t rule out the possibility of extending the 90-day tariff reprieve. “We’ll have to see what happens at that time,” he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that he expects the administration to be “in a place of great certainty over the next 90 days.” THANK YOU Defense Department scraps $5.1B worth of technology and consulting contracts At Next, Google Cloud makes a credible claim to lead the new era of enterprise AI Silicon photonics startup nEye raises $58M to light up AI data centers Amazon's Andy Jassy reiterates the need to spend billions on building out AI infrastructure Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines reportedly raising $2B in funding SentinelLabs exposes AkiraBot spam tool powered by OpenAI-generated messages Defense Department scraps $5.1B worth of technology and consulting contracts POLICY - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 MINS AGO At Next, Google Cloud makes a credible claim to lead the new era of enterprise AI AI - BY ROBERT HOF . 5 HOURS AGO Silicon photonics startup nEye raises $58M to light up AI data centers INFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 18 HOURS AGO Amazon's Andy Jassy reiterates the need to spend billions on building out AI infrastructure AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 19 HOURS AGO Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines reportedly raising $2B in funding AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 20 HOURS AGO SentinelLabs exposes AkiraBot spam tool powered by OpenAI-generated messages SECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 21 HOURS AGO

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy calls for startup culture in shareholder letter to drive innovation

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently outlined his vision for the company in an annual letter to shareholders, blending startup-style agility with the scale of a global giant. He addressed challenges, including artificial intelligence investments and internal culture shifts, and stressed the need to innovate quickly and cut inefficiencies to remain competitive in fast-moving markets. Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, said he wants to run Amazon as if it were "the world's largest startup." The approach focuses on solving customer problems, encouraging invention, and giving employees ownership of their work. "Builders hate bureaucracy," Jassy wrote. "It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do." He revealed that in his time, Amazon had solicited employee feedback on bureaucratic hurdles and implemented over 375 changes based on nearly 1,000 responses. Jassy also detailed Amazon's artificial intelligence strategy, noting that a large share of this year's $100 billion in capital spending will go toward AI projects – especially within the Amazon Web Services division. Amazon's push to embed AI across customer-facing products and internal systems makes AWS crucial to its AI goals. Healthcare was another focal point in Jassy's letter. He highlighted Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical as key growth areas and pledged to "iterate quickly" to expand both services. Jassy's tenure has brought major cultural and structural shifts to Amazon. In addition to cost-cutting efforts that led to tens of thousands of layoffs, he has enforced a return-to-office policy for corporate employees, rolling back the remote work flexibility introduced during the pandemic. Jassy emphasized key principles for maintaining Amazon's innovative edge. Speed was a recurring theme. "Speed is a leadership decision," he wrote, stressing that companies can move quickly without sacrificing quality by removing structural barriers and streamlining decision-making processes. He emphasized scrappiness as a key trait of effective teams, referencing Amazon's early days when small teams with limited resources developed services like Simple Storage Service and Elastic Compute Cloud. Jassy believes that fear of failure often stifles creativity, arguing that bold bets driven by customer obsession are key to achieving extraordinary results. "You rarely, if ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everyone else," he wrote. Ultimately, Jassy stressed that delivering tangible customer value is Amazon's most important success metric. Charisma or internal politics, he noted, should never take precedence over results when it comes to rewards or recognition.

Title: Corporate Bitcoin holdings concentrated in few custodians pose systemic risk

Jameson Lopp argued that enterprise adoption of Bitcoin without sovereignty is a 'footgun.' Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. As Bitcoin’s (BTC) appeal as a treasury asset grows, Casa co-founder and CSO Jameson Lopp assessed that concentrating the amount of BTC on a few custody service providers might pose a systemic risk. Lopp said: “The ‘Bitcoin Corporate Treasury’ narrative is a footgun if it’s not accompanied by the sovereignty via self custody narrative. Number Go Up folks are pitching companies to funnel their funds into a handful of trusted third parties. Systemic Risk Go Up.” This is not the first time Lopp has raised concerns over custody this week. He previously questioned whether a third party would act as custodian in response to Pierre Rochard’s announcement of the Bitcoin Bond Company on April 7. The firm plans to invest up to $1 trillion in Bitcoin until 2046. Rochard said there are already “lots of great institutional custodians to work with.” Based on Bitcoin Treasuries data, public and private companies currently hold 1,019,136 BTC in their treasuries. This amount equals 32.3% of the 3,150,000 BTC controlled by large entities and 5.13% of the total 19,849,381 BTC in circulation. The expanding role of custodians in managing institutional Bitcoin positions parallels patterns observed in traditional finance. Institutions typically rely on licensed custodians to meet internal governance requirements and regulatory compliance. Strategy executive president Michael Saylor highlighted this usage in October 2024 when he said that the risk of government seizure of Bitcoins is lower when held with institutional custodians. Saylor said they “adhere to legal and tax obligations.” Saylor’s company has over 528,000 BTC in its treasury, divided between custodians such as Fidelity, Anchorage Digital, and Coinbase Prime. Notably, these are the same services used by high-profile entities interacting with Bitcoin, such as BlackRock, which relies on Coinbase and recently added Anchorage. While this may streamline treasury management, it creates single points of failure in a network built for distributed control, such as Bitcoin. However, the solution might not be as simple as self-custody. Kaia’s chairman Sangmin Seo highlighted that, although the lack of self-custody introduces risks, “sovereignty without usability creates friction.” He concluded: “Infra builders need to solve both, or we’re just rebranding old models.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: XRP ETF debut stuns investors in bear market, analyst claims

What’s driving this crypto product surge despite market downturn? Teucrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF had an impressive debut on the New York Stock Exchange on the 8th of April. The launch recorded an impressive $5.43 million in turnover on its first day, despite Ripple [XRP] facing significant price pressure. Trading under the ticker XXRP, the ETF managed to achieve this success amid a broader crypto market downturn, with Bitcoin [BTC] slipping to $78,000 and XRP reaching a five-month low of $1.61. On the 8th of April, XRP’s price briefly rebounded to $1.87 before dipping back to $1.69 by evening. Despite this volatility, Teucrium proceeded with the launch of its ETF, aimed at enabling investors to profit from price swings in either direction. XXRP’s impressive performance, even amid bearish market conditions, received praise from Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who characterized the launch as “very respectable.” Balchunas said, “$XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions.” He added, “That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X That being said, Teucrium’s XXRP ETF outperformed similar ETFs like Solana’s [SOL] ETF product by a significant margin, with trading volume about four times higher. This puts the ETF launch in the top 5% of all new ETFs. However, despite the strong debut, the figure still falls short of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF launch, which saw trading volume approximately 200 times larger. While the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, recent developments in global economics, such as the pause in President Trump’s tariff plans, have provided a boost. At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap surged to $2.59 trillion, reflecting a 5.67% increase in just 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin rose to $81,752, a 5.98% hike, while XRP saw a remarkable 9.53% increase, trading at $1.99. However, despite the positive price movement, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the neutral level, indicating that bearish sentiment still dominates. On the brighter side, the widening Bollinger Bands suggested that increased volatility could be on the horizon, offering a potential reversal of the bearish trend. Source: Trading View While the initial success of XXRP was notable, many XRP supporters are optimistic that a future spot XRP ETF—tentatively dubbed “IXRP”—could generate even greater competition in the market. Data from Polymarket suggests a 77% chance that Ripple’s spot ETF could be approved by 2025, fueling further speculation on the growth potential of XRP in the ETF space. This momentum comes at a time when over ten major asset managers, including Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, have filed applications with the SEC for a spot XRP ETF. Notably, BlackRock has yet to show interest in launching an XRP-specific product, leaving the door wide open for other firms to lead the way in this growing market.

Title: Panama on edge as US targets China's canal influence

Panama and the US appear to have agreed to let American warships use the Panama Canal, effectively for free. But beneath the agreement is an ongoing threat to Panamanian sovereignty over the use of the canal. US warships could soon enjoy free and priority use of the Panama Canal, but there's still a long way to go before tensions in one of the world's most important trade passages are resolved. Panama's strategic value — to the US and many other shipping nations — is thanks to its 51-mile (82-kilometer) canal, which allows ships to easily pass between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans without needing to unload cargo or sail around South America. The canal has been thrust into the limelight since the return of Donald Trump as US president in January. Trump is opposed to China's growing influence in the region, and has repeatedly spoken about "reclaiming" the canal — which the US ceded to Panama in 1999. He hasn't ruled out a military invasion to achieve his goal. Amid tensions over Trump's rhetoric, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino this week to shore up relations. A joint statement released by the pair on Wednesday struck a friendly tone, but sticking points remain. Mulino has already worked to appease the Trump administration on the subject of China. After a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February Panama confirmed it would exit China's Belt and Road initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects including ports and airports around the world. Separately, Mulino's administration has pressured Chinese conglomerates that own Panamanian ports to exit the country. On Wednesday, the first point in the Hegseth-Mulino statement directly addressed another key Trump talking point: tolls. Trump has consistently labelled the canal usage fees paid by the US as a "bad deal" — even though, under the canal neutrality treaty, all nations are charged the same rates. While Panama has said it's impossible to give the US free passage under those terms, it appears US warships may get a cost-neutral compensation scheme instead, along with priority access. "First and free," as Hegseth described it after talks with Mulino. And while Panama's military is the only force allowed to use the canal, the two countries have agreed to undertake joint military exercises. However, Panama has said it won't accept the reestablishment of US military bases in the country. But there remained one stark point of contention. The Spanish-language version of the joint statement, released by Panama, said "Hegseth recognized Panama's leadership and inalienable sovereignty over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas." That line didn't appear in the English version released by the Pentagon. Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist professor at the University of Essex in the UK, said the omission was almost certainly a ploy to keep Panama guessing about the intentions of the Trump administration. "I think it was on purpose not to put it in the English version, to make Panama feel uncertain and not feel like the situation has been resolved," she told DW. The US built the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914, creating a massive waterway between the country's Pacific and Caribbean shorelines. It enabled American ships — including naval vessels — to easily pass between the two oceans. Negotiations to cede control back to Panama began under the Kennedy administration in the early 1960s, and were continued by Democrat and Republican presidents until Jimmy Carter formalized treaties with Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos in 1977. Those treaty deals saw Panama take control of the canal on New Year's Eve 1999, under the conditions that it be operated neutrally. Contrary to claims by Trump, the canal wasn't gifted to the Panamanians, nor is it controlled by China. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video But China does wield influence in the canal — it's the second-biggest user behind the US, and Chinese firms operate ports at each end. That concerns the US, and especially the hawkish Trump administration. The president has been clear in his intent to neutralize China's growing influence around the world, as evidenced by his new trans-Pacific trade war. Though Hegseth said US security would be achieved by a partnership with Panama, Trump has repeatedly failed to rule out military intervention to reclaim the canal. That would represent a dramatic about-face on US foreign policy. In 1975, then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Republican President Ford that failure to negotiate a handover of the canal would lead to "real uproar; volunteers, demonstrations, violence, and we would be dragged into every international forum. This is no issue to face the world on. It looks like pure colonialism." In Panama, that sentiment remains today, with regular protests since Trump first spoke of retaking the waterway. This week, around 200 people protested Hegseth's visit in Panama City and one demonstrator burned a US flag. Lindstaedt, herself Panamanian, said Trump's return had left Panama and the wider region concerned. "This has basically dominated the headlines in Panama, with just complete bewilderment and fear as to why they are doing this and when will it end," she said. "The US is not very popular in Panama at the moment, at all." However, Jorge Heine, a former Chilean ambassador to China and international relations expert at Boston University, believes it's unlikely a Trump-led US would go ahead with a military intervention. "President Trump combines a rhetoric that at times can sound extremely aggressive," he told DW. "But at the same time, he has conveyed that he really isn't very interested in being a war monger, and in otherwise deploying US military force as aggressively as some of his predecessors." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video China, the top trading partner for Central and South America, has rebuffed Hegseth's claims of it being a "malign" influence in Panama. Beijing has also struck back with an antitrust review into a proposed acquisition of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings' assets in the canal by American investment firm BlackRock. That will further complicate BlackRock's efforts to acquire $22.8 billion (€20.6 billion) of Hutchison's global port assets — including two sites in Panama. The deal was announced in March, welcomed by Trump and criticized by Beijing. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the deal could take nine months to be certified. Hutchison is also caught up by a Panama government investigation into a 25-year agreement it signed in 2021 to allow the conglomerate to operate two ports in the canal. Lawsuits are being considered against government officials involved in authorizing the deal. But attempts to squeeze Chinese influence in the region may not be in the best interests of either side. "The United States' effort to diminish the Chinese presence in Latin America, you could argue, is a legitimate approach," said Heine. But, he added, if the US really wanted to "win over the hearts and minds" of governments and people in Latin America, it should not "block China from doing business" in the region. "That goes down very badly, because it is seen as something that essentially blocks Latin American growth," he said. "The best way to proceed is for the United States to compete with China: to say 'We can build better ports, we can do more trade, we can build better factories, we can do better business with you'."

Title: ‘Rock Band’ With Your Hands: VR Game ‘Beatable’ Looks Incredible
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/04/10/rock-band-with-your-hands-vr-game-beatable-looks-incredible/

ByMatt Gardner ByMatt Gardner, Senior Contributor. 'Beatable' has all the hallmarks of the next big rhythm-action game for VR. Everyone’s drummed with their hands, so it’s frankly mind-boggling that it’s taken until 2025 for a company to adapt this simple human urge into a mixed-reality experience. XR Games has created Beatable to finally gamify the pastime, and it looks like an incredibly affordable must-buy experience on Meta Quest. Beatable, which enters early access on the Meta Horizon Store today, only costs $9.99 and lets you play music using your hands on a table. There’s no danger of smashing your Meta Quest controllers, running through over half a dozen plastic Rock Band drum sets (guilty!), or missing an input on an elaborately designed virtual rig — this is as tactile as they come. Really, it might be the most intuitive physical game ever made for VR headsets. All you need is an appropriately raised flat surface (e.g. tea tray, footstool, very docile and level-spined dog) for tapping, clapping, and finger snapping. It hopes to make the genre more of a real-world, tactile experience, and really, it needs to be seen to be believed — a record-setting performance by XR creative director Chuan Liu, filmed without the bells and whistles of post-production, shows how the mechanics work, and just how scalable the game could be for veteran rhythm-action players. Beatable is pushing itself as the prime way to turn your real-life space into a studio — and part of the game. While you’re fully in control with your hands to make beats and gestures to hit notes, XR Games has also built in calibration tools to keep it as accurate as possible. If you want to remove yourself from your surroundings, that’s fine too, as you can ditch the mixed-reality settings. FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder XR’s Beatable soundtrack has launched with songs from artists local to the developer — including multi-platinum British DJ Tom Zanetti, bhangra group RDB, and Gamini Khurara — plus tunes from its previous, delightfully fun release Zombieland: Headshot Fever. It aims to curate an audio experience that doesn’t rely on a load of stock rhythm-game songs at you, much like vanilla Beat Saber. It sounds like XR is excited for more musical expansions, and if Beatable proves to be a hit, the best thing it could do is offer deep support for musicians and creators to add their own tracks, and even adapt others in the public domain, much like the superb Trombone Champ. All strictly legal, of course — but opening the floodgates for more content is always critical to long-term success. If you want to become an early adopter (I’m picking it up for the weekend), XR Games offers a Discord for those who want to give feedback or swap scores. It’s early access right now, but the simplicity of the idea could send Beatable to the moon. Let’s hope this one takes off.

April 10, 2025 14:01 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, April 10, 2025: This post has been adjusted to reflect the change in U.S. tariffs on China to 145%. Nvidia stock has fallen 30% from its January 2025 peak of $153, evaporating $1.03 trillion from the company’s market capitalization, according to Google Finance. One thing contributing to the drop is the results of the 2024 presidential election which brought Donald Trump back to the Oval Office. Since April 2, his tariff policy has thrown markets into turmoil. And despite Trump’s trumpeting of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, Nvidia could be in worse shape. That’s because tariffs are high on countries where Nvidia products are built. More specifically, Taiwan faced a 34% tariff – reduced Wednesday to 10% – while China’s rose to 145% on April 10, according to the Wall Street Journal. Is the drop in Nvidia’s stock a buying opportunity? I see no reason to buy now because although orders may have soared in the current quarter in anticipation of tariffs, I expect the company’s May 2025 earnings report to feature a disappointing growth forecast as a result of tariff uncertainty. More specifically, the uncertainty is due to the difficulty of answering precisely the following questions: Nvidia remains bullish. In March, CEO Jensen Huang said tariffs would not cause meaningful short-term harm to the company due to the company’s agile supply chain; demand for AI would drive demand, and TSMC was building a plant in Arizona, according to Barron’s. Nvidia declined to comment. A spokesperson referred me to a March 2025 company statement from Huang, which said. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” Read on for why Nvidia’s costs could rise significantly, whether Nvidia will pass along those costs to customers, and how the uncertainty around future moves in the global tariff wars may crimp consumer spending and company’s investments in generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia will report quarterly financial results next month featuring slower top-line growth and thinner margins based on the company’s forecasts when it last reported in February. Nvidia expressed enthusiasm about its prospects. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter," said Huang in a statement. "AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” Analysts were underwhelmed by Nvidia’s results – which lacked “the positive shock value of some of last year’s reports,” Sungarden YARP Portfolio Investing Group Leader Rob Isbitts told SeekingAlpha. Nvidia’s stock is likely to trade “more on raw demand and supply, rather than on some sort of surprise element,” Isbitts added. “Guidance was slightly underwhelming,” Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a report featured by Bloomberg. "We think it will be challenging for management to continue to significantly beat expectations for future growth,” Purk added. Tariffs could increase significantly the prices of some Nvidia products. However, it is unclear whether Nvidia will pass all of its increased costs on to customers and whether the higher prices would lower demand. A more significant question for Nvidia’s future is whether companies will view the high investment in generative AI as being worth the $1 trillion Goldman Sachs estimated. If the technology enables companies to do better work with fewer people, demand for generative AI may remain strong in the event of a recession. Not all of Nvidia’s products are vulnerable to being harmed by Trump’s tariffs. For example, fears of a Trump administration crackdown on Nvidia’s H20 chip – which the company has been exporting to China – may not be realized. The reason? “Nvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers,” according to a report from NPR. However, tariffs could raise consumer personal computer prices by as much as 50%, according to WCCFTech. These estimates were made April 3 when the tariff on Chinese goods was a mere 54% – a far cry from the 145% tariff imposed on April 10. Tariffs could raise manufacturer’s suggested retail price prices on the following Nvidia gaming machines by at least 50% – based on the latest triple-digit tariff: It remains unclear whether Nvidia will be able to avoid tariffs on GPUs for now. The tariffs could be avoided if actual products are assembled in the U.S., noted Tom’s Hardware. For now, Nvidia may be able to ship “actual GPUs and processors/chipsets to the U.S. without paying import duties along with half-finished logic boards – but paying an import tariff -- then assemble actual products in the U.S.,” reported Tom’s Hardware. Generative AI has been in search of a killer app, as I wrote in the Boston Globe. There has been no obvious progress on this goal and the investment required for the technology is enormous – potentially totaling $1 trillion. Prior to the tariff announcement, the largest hyperscalers – Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft – announced plans to spend $270 billion on generative AI data centers in 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, that spending could take a hit – especially for companies like Meta and Google which are dependent on advertising for much of their revenue. If tariffs and the resulting uncertainty cause a recession – due to rising prices and fear of declining demand and higher unemployment – companies could decide to cut back on their generative AI spending. The reason for cutting back would be a simple realization that the return on investment in generative AI is not yet compelling. Amazon’s cloud-computing arm historically has generated $4 of incremental revenue for every $1 of capital spending, TD Cowen John Blackledge tech analyst told the Journal. Generative AI’s ratio “is currently something like 20 cents for every dollar,” Blackledge added. Microsoft, which plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in the current fiscal year, is slowing construction – including a $1 billion project in Ohio. Microsoft canceled leases in the U.S. and Europe -- partly due to an oversupply of data-center space relative to the company’s demand forecast, noted TD Cowen analysts. However, “the moves signal a more cautious stance in the longer term,” the Journal reported. All that could be painful for Nvidia investors – unless surviving with fewer people during a long period of stagflation becomes the killer app for generative AI.

April 10, 2025 13:02 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=141981&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

The Series F — which includes participation from Atomico, BlackRock, DN Capital, Hercules, Infravia, Kibo, and Kinnevik — values the Madrid, Spain-based company at €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) post-money. On the surface, a unicorn raising a decent round of funding from a well-known list of backers might sound like pretty strong news. The reality is a little different. This is a down round for the company. Jobandtalent, which has operations in 10 countries in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America, last raised money in December 2021, a Series E of $500 million that valued it at $2.35 billion. We’ve asked for a comment from the company on why its valuation received a haircut of almost $1 billion. “This round reflects a valuation adjustment in line with broader market dynamics, particularly within the tech and growth-stage sectors,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The funding ensures that Job&Talent remains well-capitalized to execute the next phase of our growth journey. Despite challenging market conditions, we have consistently outperformed industry trends over the past year, driven by the strength of our platform and our ability to integrate AI across our entire suite of products.” Some of the reasoning may also be a reflection of the European startup scene at the moment. On the plus side: Jobandtalent was the beneficiary of strong tailwinds over the years. It came into its own in the years around COVID-19, when both businesses and workers were unsure of what was coming around the corner and gravitated to working arrangements that afforded more flexibility. Certain sectors, like e-commerce and the wider ecosystem of delivery and logistics around it, were positively booming and needed to fill lots of roles, fast. It was an especially flush time for particular kinds of roles, and Jobandtalent found a willing audience of businesses and workers taking to its platform to connect to each other. The company says over the years it has placed more than 300,000 workers in roles at more than 3,250 companies, with a particular emphasis on sectors like logistics and retail. Yet the company’s funding news today is coming at an unsettling time: The European labor market since the COVID-19 pandemic has been buffeted by a number of opposing economic waves. Skills and people shortages have spelled opportunity for those who can fill the gaps; yet declining corporate profits and a stagnating Eurozone economy could spell tougher times ahead. And that’s before you consider what kind of impact AI might have. It’s still unproven, but businesses and governments are staking a lot on AI being a cost-effective solution for some kinds of work, and that too could spell bad news for certain jobs. Jobandtalent is sitting in a strange position in that regard. The company’s bread and butter remains the human workforce, but it’s also leaning into ways it can use AI to be more “work efficient.” The company says that the new injection of equity will be used to scale the business internationally and to invest in building a series of AI-powered agents into the platform to support that. The first of these is called Clara, an agent focused on recruitment. In a test with a limited number of clients, Clara has conducted no less than 180,000 interviews, the company said, contributing to some 7,000 hires and “helping deliver industry-leading fill rates, even during peak periods of demand.” Jobandtalent says that the fill rates are “equivalent to the output of thousands of recruiters.” Jobandtalent said it plans to launch further agents this year to cover other functions previously handled by humans. “This capital injection reaffirms our shared vision for the future of Job&Talent,” Juan Urdiales, the startup’s co-founder and co-CEO, said in a statement. “Thanks to the platform we have built over the past years, we are now well-positioned to evolve into a fully integrated employment platform that helps companies manage their temporary and internal workforces more efficiently. Our next-generation AI agents will bring major improvements in productivity, provide better opportunities for workers, and unlock crucial cost savings for companies.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Amazon plans huge expansion of its logistics facilities When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is reportedly planning to invest a staggering $15 billion across no less than 80 new logistics facilities across the US in a bid to better serve both cities and rural areas. A report from Bloomberg claims the company is planning to develop new delivery hubs, with some being large fulfillment centers equipped with state-of-the-art robots. Amazon is now inviting capital partners to submit proposals in what’s seen as welcome news amid ongoing tariff-induced economic uncertainty. When the world moved to remote and online habits during the pandemic, Amazon was believed to have overspent on retail infrastructure and staffing, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. Between November 2022 and March 2023, Amazon laid off around 27,000 workers. Although its ecommerce business continues to grow, recent investments have largely focused on cloud and AI technologies, so it’s reassuring to see that the online retail giant is hasn’t given up on what it’s known best for by consumers. Speaking about the company’s fourth-quarter and year-end results, Jassy noted Amazon had delivered its “fastest speeds ever” for Prime in 2024, with a 65% year-over-year increase in US orders delivered on the same day or overnight, thanks largely to its expansive network of logistics facilities and transportation resources. The company now has around 600 fulfillment centers in the US alone, but no timeline has been shared for the addition of another 80. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite a positive outlook, it’s clear that Amazon isn’t immune from the ongoing trade war, having reportedly canceled numerous orders from China and other Asian countries over tariffs. Amazon told us that the projects being discussed aren't finalized, but they are still ideas that are up for consideration. Steve Kelly, a spokesperson for Amazon, noted: "Meetings like this with our capital partners are routine and part of the normal due diligence process, as we consider potential, future projects." The company also confirmed some figures to us – Amazon supports nearly five million jobs across the US, having invested over $244 billion into the nation in 2023 alone.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change An X article by Tom Nelson The climate scam is imploding right now. Of course there are still plenty of remaining pockets of climate cultism, but the whole movement is crumbling. It’s the most massive scientific fraud in human history, and it will take significant time to completely die, but make no mistake: It IS dying. In no particular order, here are some updates on the climate scam implosion. Please keep scrolling. We have come a *long* way since Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich sat down to endorse Al Gore’s climate scam in 2008! After discovering so many massive, high-profile COVID lies in recent years, large numbers of people are asking themselves “What else are they lying about?”, and the answer is “just about everything”.

That forced him to scale back. It also drove him to open the taps on the SPR and drain in down to less than half its capacity by the time he left office. So the politics of soaring prices for voters and the ever present “next election” will be the drag/friction that stops any President in having a war on affordable energy. I’m hoping that President Trump’s about-face on tariffs will bring gas prices down. They’ve gone up $0.30 in the last week. These things require a little patience, watching for the fever to break: Gasoline (wholesale) closed today at $1.95 / gallon. Crude petroleum (WTI) has averaged ~ $60 / bbl (equivalent to ~ $1.43 / gallon) over the entire week — lowest since February of 2021. A couple weeks back, USA Energy Sec’y Wright reportedly said that $50 per bbl is a level where major producers could remain profitable, and they agreed, contrary to so much earlier handwringing. If past price / market-share wars are any guide, one shouldn’t be surprised to see $42 / bbl (equiv to $1./gallon, for wholesale gasoline approaching $1.50 a gallon). ? If that doesn’t sound deflationary, like going back to 2019 times, what would? Yes, but the difference now, I think, is that the general public have had more exposure to the Sceptical view. As such, there are more people now, better informed and less likely to support the alarmist narrative that had an unchallenged free platform for decades up to now. I have always said that the whole scam thrives on public opinion supporting the scam. As long as it is ”popular” politicians can depend on the vote to keep them in the dollars. Speak for yourselves And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” They can try, but given the science of climate absolutely shows humans have very little long-term impact on climate hazards or global temperatures, except within cities where urban warming is skewing observational data. The main thing is that confected alarm over modern warming is illogical, as historic warming is beneficial to society, and the warmer cities have already experienced well above the imputed 2-5C crisis limits without any harmful effects. So, the climate bluff has been called, the alarmists have been found wanting, they can’t any longer use the CO2 card as this is the `gas of life’ not some unwanted pollutant, we and the planet need much more CO2 to fertilize plants more efficiently and grow better crops, more forests etc. Now the public has been exposed to the truth, they will not so easily fall for the next global environmental scam, so politicians will not be able to bring this climate crisis back to life in any meaningful way. History shows that there will be a new scare (scam). Correct. Unless the root of the infection is destroyed by exposing the lack of definitive cause and effect evidence it has every chance of coming back. A leftist President can bring it all back in a blink of an eye. So 2 blinks of 1 eye, or 1 blink of 2 eyes? Yes, it is collapsing because it is a lie, but can politicians be convinced of that? When the public sees the benefits the policy changes – the politicians won’t try it again. Let’s not elect a leftist president ever again. I don’t think we did. I still want to know who ran the executive pranch from 2021 to 2024. I’d put even money on the Climate Oligarchs defended by well paid SJWs And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” Executive Order diktats are NOT the way to run a country….only encourage policy reversals every election cycle….best to pass legislation that is solid to start with rather than advocate policies that nearly half the public opposes… Mr. Vonasek: By ’28, I predict CliSci will be so over, the smart players will have moved on to the next scam, the money will shift and dems will follow that scam. Of course, “smart players” excludes Al Gore, John Kerry, Michael Mann, etc., who will still push AGW, but they won’t get much attention. Or money. Mann won’t be able to file a legitimate lawsuit. Just my prediction. “What else are they lying about”? A significantly shorter list would be… What aren’t they lying about? Just about the only thing I can think of is spherical (oblate spheroid, etc) Earth… at least I hope they’re not lying about that! This post could be the basis of An Ode To Climate Alarmists – How do I loathe thee Let me count the ways It’s all about the money, so if funding goes away, so will everyone supporting the scam. I think we are seeing the beginning of it with DOGE scrubbing all the US federal agencies of one fraud after another. I wonder if Starmer and Miliband have seen this list? Do they realize just how alone they are? I strongly Starmer is aware… Milliband, not so much Suddenly, the floor is lava. The Gavin Schmitt link doesn’t seem to work. That’s the point. It was a link to his X account. Very risky leaving your climate science out there these days 🙂 That’s because it’s Schmidt. By an odd coincidence, I was looking up the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction today (I was, seriously), but there I go again, being an organic chemistry nerd in a post that only about three people will get: Steve Case, yourself and possibly CTM ?? ???? You must be referring to this: LINK. Organic chemistry wasn’t fun. Quiz questions requiring of the student: Starting out with Benzene and inorganic reagents synthesize the DNA of a left handed Siberian Skink, isn’t far off the mark. I’m in that category too. Once an Organic Chemist, always an Organic Chemist. Thank you for keeping at it all these years ! KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK. Seconded and MOTION PASSED. Thanks, Nicholas! Hurrah. I only hope the power brokers take their heads out of the sand. Here in the UK we are unfortunately still the leading lemming heading for the cliff of self impoverishment. It’s sad to see a great nation commit suicide. Unfortunately, Australia may end up going the same way if Albo is elected again, because he will cowardly bend to all the moronically idiotic and destructive “Greens” agendas to form a government. I’ve never been to Australia- but my impression was that it’s a nation of common sense people. Same for the UK. It amazes me that there is so little resistance to the climate cult. Indeed and, sadly, it looks like Albo/labour will get back in. Quite the contrasting energy future compared to US with Trumps win. We’ll be faced with netzero, even higher electricity prices, and a bigger public service. A recession, businesses closing or fleeing, and unemployment on the rise. Maybe I’m just dreaming… It is beginning to look like a lemming charge of one. I’ll see your UK and raise you an Australia We still have a slight chance. Not a great one, but better than the UK, I hope. Unfortunately, the climate cult is still powerful here in Wokeachusetts. It’ll probably be the last place to die. State officials and the enviros still keep talking about the climate emergency. Washington State, Oregon, and Cullyfawnia will last much longer. Carney of Canada, will be the absolute last holdout. He is intent on killing Canada. If Labor is elected in the forthcoming Australian federal election, and has to rely on the Greens to form a government…. Australia won’t be far behind. He is intent on realizing the WEF agenda on Canadians. Carney is smarter version of Pretty Boy Trudeau, that makes him far more dangerous. If he defeats Poilievre, Canada is royally f’d. Carney’s wife and kids already live in New York City in anticipation of becoming the 51st state. I remember there was talk of “some sort of Climate Nuremberg”, and I think that’s an excellent idea. Might not be what they had in mind though. Let’s not conflate climate change and especially net-zero with Covid shall we, it makes legitimate sceptics like me look like the sort of science deniers the AGW activists like to portray us as. Like it or not, in the first year of Covid it killed ~500,000 in the US, 100,000+ in the UK, ~1,000,000 in Europe and probably ~6,000,000 across the world. Covid was a real thing, action was unavoidable, AGW, you be the judge. Here in the UK , I think Covid was very real , one of my work colleagues who is 50 got it , he is a non smoker , modest drinker , lean and cycles to work , he caught it in the first wave of his wife who was a nurse , it knocked him for 6 he spent 12 days in hospital, he had never been admitted to hospital before in his life . His wife who is the same age faired even worse , she is asthmatic and ended up in hospital for 4 months at one stage she was on a ventilator, they had both been through the usual coughs colds flu etc and nothing like this before . I think it was real too. However, much of what we were told about covid was lies, up one side and down the other. It most likely was manufactured in a lab, not naturally transmitted out of a wet market. Masks didn’t prevent the spread, nor did shutting schools, churches and businesses. The vaccines did not prevent one from getting covid or passing it on to others. They did not prevent people from dying of covid. And the vaccines appear to have some serious side effects. I could go on and on. I hope we never have to live through such a catastrophe again. Hospitals across the country were running out of spare beds. Exactly Starzmom. The main offensive aspect of the COVID pandemic wasn’t that COVID was a real and potentially fatal threat for many people. It was / is. Rather, it was the opportunistic gaslighting that political operatives and their main-chancer groupies resorted to. To wit – rejecting outright mRNA creator and original patent holder Dr Malone’s instruction that mRNA was NOT an appropriate vehicle for immunisations injections. But pharmas had already set their sights and invested heavily in using (abusing?) the mRNA technology. Then the accepted term “vaccine” and what worldwide populations had come to expect what that meant and delivered – i.e. immunity from acquisition and transmission of a virus or disease – was disingenuously highjacked to describe a therapeutic, mRNA jabs that did not prevent acquisition nor transmission. And this blatant defect was admitted by Pfizer in their submissions to the FDA. Which the Biden administration tried to lock away from public disclosure for 70 years. And don’t get me started on the masks bullshit – the long-established and cited Cochrane organisation’s masks testing & reporting belled the cat about masks for COVID containment from the outset – masks were totally ineffective. And yet we were all told we HAD to don these fancy-dress ball accessories at all times in public. Nobody is denying Covid wasnt a thing. Action was indeed unavoidable. But most of the choices and actions were the wrong ones and did more damage than good. You be the judge.. Can anyone name anything that was done to mitigate covid that was effective? The countries that used invermectin and HCQ for a few cents per dose…especially prior to infection. In the US, the average age of a person who died from Covid was older than the expected lifespan. Doctors and researchers made a profile of the most vulnerable. Elderly, obese, diabetic, etc., etc. Johns Hopkins published a web page with a Covid risk calculator. The page is here: https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2020/new-online-covid-19-mortality-risk-calculator-could-help-determine-who-should-get-vaccines-first It appears the calculator hasn’t been updated since it was published. Now that the pandemic is over studies show the 6 ft/1 meter distancing rules were just made up, masks are ineffective in stopping the spread, the shots don’t work and the public health cabal lied about all the above. Johns Hopkins looked like one of the heros to me as far as info distribution went. Action was unavoidable, but the actions taken were most obviously almost pointless. Yes, prevent spreading until vaccines are available, but: 1. Test vaccines first 2. Don’t imprison your citizens 3. Don’t stop economic activity And LOCK DOWN NURSING HOMES, NOT EVERYONE ELSE! Honestly, the approaches were beyond stupid, and today we’re paying a hefty price, and will for a decade or so. Even I predicted both mass unemployment and rampant inflation! And yes, I got covid at least once, and long covid for a year or so. Vaccines were tested extensively first, and finally approved by actual professors of medicine, and not some random guy on Twitter. As to the rest, I can only speak for the UK, but in the first wave the NHS was about a week from collapse, during the peak of the second wave there were 40,000 people in hospital with the virus, i.e. ~50% of all hospital beds, some form of lockdown was unavoidable. Also, locking down nursing homes was exactly what they did during the second wave, those 40,000 patients were largely coming from the wider community, with the tier system, rejecting a firebreak lockdown (in England anyway), testing, social distancing etc, the government was clearly doing everything in its power to limit restrictions, but at the end of the day the virus was extremely contagious and very difficult to contain. If we made a mistake, it was not shielding the vulnerable from early March, if we’d done that maybe we could’ve avoided at least some of the March 23 measures, but unfortunately SAGE dropped the ball on that one. Safe and effective 😉 We’d probably still be in lockdown without the vaccine, would you be happier with that? Ask Eric Clapton about his opinion/experience of the WuFlu vaccines. Clapton was already a Covid denier before the vaccines came along, and AFAICS is still alive and well, so let’s treat any claims he makes about “reactions” with a healthy dose of professional scepticism. Also, while you’re at it, why don’t you ask the large numbers of 75 year-old’s who died from Covid pre-vaccine what their opinions/experience are of no longer being alive? How do you know the vaccines would have prevented them from dying? In the US, the drugs were rushed to people under an emergency use authorization, which are dependent on there being no other treatments available — this was a 100% lie put out by the CDC, NIH, and Marx Stream Media. Because professors of medicine tell me so, and I prefer their opinion to that of some random bloke on the internet. I was a 90 year old who got the shots and still got COVID and am still alive. A friend of similar age refused the shots and did not get it and is still alive. What can you conclude from this? That the shots possibly saved your life, and your friend got lucky. IFR of Covid-19 was significantly lower than the ordinary flu. BTW that’s even after paying hospitals and doctors for diagnosing Covid-19 even when co-morbidities were much more severe. The supposed pathogen has never been found in a patient, it only exist as a model in computers, in silico. What a minute that reminds me of something….oh yeah the climatecult’s sole proof: their models, which are all wrong. The supposed pathogen has never gone trough Koch’s postulates and there is still a million euro’s waiting for the first researcher to publish the genetich code of this remarkable virus. There is not even a test to determine wether or not this “virus” is present in a patient. The orginal author of the “PCR-test” has now admitted as much. BTW this originbal paper was peer-reviewed in couple of hours….. So yes they have been hiding a lot, lying trough their teeth and are never to be trusted again. That’s just plain common sense, nothing else. Nice list. Thx. Google/Youtube & Meta/Facebook still have yet to get the message: they still demonetize or censor climate skeptics and sites like WUWT. As many have mentioned elsewhere, unless inacted as legislation the next president’s Executive Orders could reverse much of the current beneficial changes. I would rather enacted than inacted. ….. and Wikipedia. I wonder how that’s going to read when our host gets the Congressional Medal of Freedom? Also, PS – yes #10 is worth reading some more. One of the Founders of that sh!tshow was the Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party: Aspiration was founded in 2013 by Andrei Cherny and Joseph Sanberg It opened for business in February 2015. …. and here’s another, similar cluster**** https://finsworld.com/ecology/co-founder-of-climate-finance-unicorn-arrested-on-fraud-charges Notice any patterns here? Climate, fraud, climate, fraud, climate, fraud and so on and so forth. “NASA GISS funding “terminated”?: “New NASA Chief Will Wind Down Climate Alarm Shop“.” Before completely closing down, they should make GISS write up an after-action report to document the results of their decades of “climate” work. Here is a template to save them some time: It can now be confirmed that it was a serious error all along to have supposed that incremental “greenhouse gases” such as CO2, CH4, N2O were capable of forcing energy absorbed from the sun to accumulate on land, in the oceans, and in the atmosphere itself as sensible heat gain. Upon further review, it is clear that while the static radiative effect could indeed be real, the resulting influence on any trend of any climate metric is negligible. There is no risk of a harmful outcome, nor is there any “tipping point” to be concerned about in the climate system. We regret constructing our step-iterated, large-grid, discrete-layer, parameter-tuned climate models. It turns out that the inherent uncertainties involved in cloud formation and dissipation are such that there was never any hope of reliably projecting future climate states from scenarios of assumed emissions of CO2, etc. These uncertainties were suppressed by first tuning the models for stability, which is known not to be realistic. Then by framing the investigation of incremental CO2 as a matter of “forcing” + “feedback,” the expected “warming” response was baked in from the start. We were well-intentioned but completely in the wrong scientifically to have ever used such utterly circular logic. We acknowledge, with deep disappointment in our own work, to have constructed a record of global temperatures from the limited observations in the 1800’s and early 1900’s. It should have been obvious to us that any claim to a precise preindustrial climate state was pure fiction. We regret the error. An internal review confirms that the assertions of CO2 as the climate “control knob” were for public persuasion purposes only. No scientist here ever actually believed that. There. Maybe I saved them some effort. Ha! Riiiiiight. Wouldn’t it be a perfect ending, though? 🙂 Semi-serious suggestion, with Apologies to Bridge on the River Kwai: Don’t you know what will happen to me if I fail to convince the world that it is going to fry in hell if it doesn’t provide me with a sinecure that makes me rich? Haven’t the foggiest. Haven’t the foggiest. I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! Good summary. I’m not so sure about this: “We were well-intentioned” I think their climate change agenda is their motivation. “Hottest year Evah!, by hundreds of a degree, year after year after year. Pure computer mannipulation. UAH shows nothing like it. UAH shows cooling while NASA shows warming. This was not well-intentioned. The NASA Temperature Data Mannipulation was meant to scare the Public into submission. A fair point! While all of this is true now is not the time to ease up, there are a lot of bad things that we must undo. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. We have an upcoming Federal election and I was looking at statements from different parties. Even the National Party (think country pseudo-conservatives) are anti fossil fuel, with these delusional statements.. The NSW Nationals support the uptake of cost-effective renewable energy options, including solar and wind-powered microgrids with battery backup……. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. It is hard to find someone to vote for that supports realistic energy supplies like COAL and GAS and OIL. Vote for One Nation or Libertarians or few other so called freedom parties. Realistically, they have only chance to spoil the two main parties majority though. If the Libertarians and One Nation can get the balance of power in the Senate… … hopefully would that help nullify the worst of the Greens/Labor nation destroying idiocies. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. Both parties are extremely scientifically illiterate and are frightened down to the bone of the CSIRO and others. However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time…. I did hear that Bowen may very well lose his seat so at least that’s something. “However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time….” You are correct. The only unknown is how long it will take. Will Australia have to go bankrupt before their politicians understand that windmills and solar and batteries are not going to be the solution to their imaginary CO2 problem? Windmills and solar and batteries will reduce CO2 output, but will end up destroying Australia and its economy. Is that really what Australian politicians want? Michael Mann and Phil Jones must be very proud of themselves. They have managed to fool the Elites of the Left (and some fools on the Right) into thinking CO2 is a danger to humanity. Climate Change Science Fraud has caused a dangerous reaction in gullible/greedy people, leading to the eventual downfall of whole nations. Brainwashing works. Smart people are not immune. Haven’t they also made it illegal to pray over someone if the intent of the prayer is to keep them from being trans? But the MSM still won’t report the fact that CO2 is not dangerous, and until they do the Bandar-log will keep on spending our money on useless “carbon reducing” schemes. “The right people” have to be holding the bill before they change the story. Watch pension funds. Yes, the lying Leftwing Media is the most dangerous organization in the Western world. People cannot govern themselves properly if they don’t have the truth, and all they get are leftwing lies from the Media. The lying Leftwing Media is the reason 72 million people! voted for an idiot like Kamala Harris for President of the United States. Imagine what things would look like if she got elected. Yes, the Lying Leftwing Media is more dangerous to your personal freedoms than even communist China. The intentional deceivers among them are traitors to their nations. Good list. JD Vance will finish what 47 doesn’t. At the moment AOC leads the Democrat listings…. Pray that NEVER happens. ! I’m not sure about that mate. A lot of people here are praying that it does happen, although there’s a new contender for the most stupid person in Congress: Jasmine Crockett. That’s always a good career path. Look at Adam Schiff. Vance/Gabbard, or maybe even Gabbard/Vance ? Vance/Rubio. In fact, a lot of Trump’s cabinet members could make a good president. The radical Democrats have no bench to pick from, and no ideas. Any good idea they come up with, is already in the Republican playbook. NASA/GISS should either be completely shut-down (preferred), or if not possible without Congressional action, have its mission refocused back on SpaceWeather phenomenon. I would add a #34. ICF has had its contract terminated with NASA. ICF was the private company that coordinated the interagency US National Climate Assessment since 2021. It was huge grift on the taxpayer initiated by Biden Regime. Paying out wasteful advisory fees to Climate morons like Hayhoe, Mann, and Dessler to keep them on the bandwagon of climate grift. Let’s hope that NCA beast remains dead and forgotten. Joel! You’re back! Where have you been, buddy? Sweet, sweet music to my ears. All governments continuously lie to you about all things great and small. Leftist Deep State entities have taken control of government policies. It does no good to change Federal Executive Branch leaders and politicians; the wreckers just burrow in deeper and wait them out. Find ways to get rid of them or hobble them by clear instructions about their powers and authorities. We need to do away with whole agencies and restrict other agencies’ ability to set national policies and establish regulations that are not supported by clear Congressional directives. I doubt whether any significant percentage of the general public anywhere was taken in by the climate change alarmism in the first place. When they noticed that it was accompanied by higher taxes and costly green mandates at the same time that they were noticing the usual fluctuation of temperatures and weather events, they began to smell a rat. As a result, when they refused to make any major lifestyle changes that would supposedly combat what wasn’t occurring anyway and began to support policies and actions that supported their tendencies, they were driving home the first nails in the coffin of climate alarmism and Net Zero intentions. The article above is merely summarizing the actions that the big players like governments and major industries and businesses are taking to end the climate change charade.

Title: Prada to buy Versace for 1.25 bn euros to create new force in Italian fashion
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/3000579/prada-to-buy-versace-for-1-25-bn-euros-to-create-new-force-in-italian-fashion
Time Published: 2025-04-10T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
MILAN (ITALY) - Prada said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion), building a new Italian fashion powerhouse and hoping to insert much-needed "spark" into its smaller, flashier rival. The much anticipated acquisition, from US group Capri Holdings, will create a group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada Group chairman Patrizio Bertelli said. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. But amid declining sales it sought a buyer, opening exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times had reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. - Donatella's departure - Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella will now serve as Versace's chief brand ambassador. While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's lustre has faded in recent years. Capri had expected turnover to fall to $810 million during its 2025 fiscal year, according to Prada, down from $1.03 billion a year earlier. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite a global slowdown in luxury good sales in recent years, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, on revenues that grew 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive, said Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. For its part, Capri said the sale would allow it to step up investments in Michael Kors and strengthen its balance sheet. - No revolution - The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio and promised to "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity". "I don't think we need to change the brand, to revolutionise it," Prada's marketing director, Lorenzo Bertelli, told analysts during a conference call. "We need to just evolve it... all together, they're going to make, hopefully, a huge spark and bring back Versace to be a huge success." Bertelli, the eldest son of Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli and who is expected one day to take over, said his mother would not have creative involvement in Versace. - Core business - The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Title: Ireland make three changes for Six Nations game against England

Full Content:
Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has made three changes to the starting team that hammered Italy 54-12 in Parma for Saturday’s Six Nations championship match against an all-conquering England at Musgrave Park (4.45). The visitors are looking for a 32nd consecutive victory in the tournament, a run that started with victory over Ireland in 2018. Emily Lane is promoted from the bench to scrumhalf in place of Aoibheann Reilly who heads in the opposite direction in the only change to the starting backline. Injury has ruled out flanker Edel McMahon and her place in the backrow goes to Brittany Hogan. The Ulster player started on the bench in Italy, but Bemand opted for a conventional five-three split rather than the six-two orientation of the last day. This means that outhalf Nicole Fowley is named in the matchday 23. Dorothy Wall swaps places with Ruth Campbell and will partner Old Belvedere’s Fiona Tuite in the secondrow. Enya Breen picked up an injury the last day and so Wicklow’s Vicky Elmes Kinlan is set to make her Six Nations debut and will wear the number 23 jersey. England head coach John Mitchell has made three changes to the team that hammered Wales last time out. Abby Dow will earn her 50th cap, the Trailfinders Women wing scored twice against the Welsh taking her try tally for England to 43 in 49 games to date, since her two-try debut against Canada in 2017. She forms part of an unchanged backline with Mitchell making three changes to the pack. Gloucester-Hartpury backrow Alex Matthews returns for her first appearance of the tournament with club team-mate Maud Muir and Bristol Bears’ Hannah Botterman coming into the frontrow. IRELAND: S Flood (Railway Union); A McGann (Railway Union), A Dalton (Old Belvedere), E Higgins (Railway Union), A-L Costigan (Railway Union, capt); D O’Brien (Old Belvedere), E Lane (Blackrock College); N O’Dowd (Old Belvedere), N Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), L Djougang (Old Belvedere); F Tuite (Old Belvedere), D Wall (Exeter Chiefs); B Hogan (Old Belvedere), E King (Old Belvedere), A Wafer (Blackrock College). Replacements: C Moloney (Exeter Chiefs), S McCarthy (Railway Union), C Haney (Blackrock College), R Campbell (Old Belvedere), G Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), A Reilly (Blackrock College), N Fowley (Galwegians), V Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow).

Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%) stock fell more than 5% in afternoon trading certainty, with Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) and the other Magnificent 7 shares also losing ground as investors continued to reassess the fallout from this week’s abrupt tariff pause — and its likely ripple effects across corporate IT spending. Adding to the pressure, Wedbush Securities cut its 12-month price target for Microsoft stock by almost 14%, from $550 per share to $475. Wedbush warned that economic whiplash and tariff turmoil were putting enterprise tech budgets on ice, especially for big-ticket cloud and AI projects. The influential investment firm maintained its Outperform rating on Microsoft stock but said the “tariff game of poker” unfolding in Washington has already “created real damage to the corporate spending mentality.” Microsoft, with deep exposure to AI and cloud infrastructure, is likely to feel that demand-side chill first. Wedbush analysts described the past week as an “economic Twilight Zone” after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs — then abruptly paused them for 90 days. While the temporary truce offered short-term relief, Wedbush emphasized that “thinking this tariff issue is now done is the wrong view,” arguing that the true impact on enterprise budgets and IT roadmaps will begin to emerge in second-quarter tech earnings. In one of its most pointed warnings, Wedbush called the tariffs “a negotiation tactic for Trump,” but said the gamble could have real and lasting consequences: “The impacts and gamble to the real economy are a snowball that once it starts rolling downhill it cannot be just stopped...and investors will see that front and center during earnings season for tech kicking off in the next few weeks.” Wedbush estimates that 10% to 15% of cloud and AI initiatives across U.S. enterprises could be pushed out amid the current economic uncertainty — potentially dragging down growth in Microsoft’s Azure and AI-linked revenue through the summer. Investors, Wedbush suggested, may need to write off the current quarter as a “mulligan” for Microsoft and other major tech firms. While remaining bullish on Microsoft, Wedbush advised that, “Investors will need to buckle the seat belt and look past the next few quarters of choppiness — and hold the tech winners through the storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 'This Is Life or Death': American Mom-and-Pop Businesses Could Still Collapse as China Tariffs Climb; Want 90-Day Pause to 'Save Christmas'

Many small businesses are still threatened by the trade war facing the United States, even though President Donald Trump suspended most tariffs for 90 days. The escalating tariffs on China have halted imports — and manufacturing — for many American companies, including mom-and-pop stores and family-owned businesses that cannot easily shift production or sourcing to other countries. ‘This is life or death,” says Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, a century-old toy manufacturing company that makes educational materials for thousands of American schools. Woldenberg told Breitbart News that the Trump administration’s tariffs on China — which hit 145% as of Thursday morning — would cause his tax bill to rise from roughly $2 million to $100 million — overnight. To stay in business, Woldenberg estimated that he would have to raise his prices 40-45%. Otherwise, “[Trump] is killing me. I’m dead.” Woldenberg also estimates that he has 10,000 molds at a port in China, weighing approximately 7,000,000 pounds, and he has to find something to do with them if he cannot import them and face the steep tax that follows. Learning Resources, and other companies that source components from China, are being forced to halt production or block shipments from leaving port in China. The result could be factory closures cascading layoffs — not just in China, which is the target of Trump’s policy, but also in the U.S, meaning Wednesday’s stock-market joy could be short-lived. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday: “More container-shipping companies are cancelling sailings from Asia to the U.S. and Europe.” And other entrepreneurs are echoing Woldenberg’s fears of a massive impact on U.S. industry — precisely the opposite of the effect intended by Trump’s policy, which aims to protect and grow U.S. manufacturing. Woldenberg would like the administration to implement a 90-day pause on the China tariffs, just as it has done with other tariffs. “At least let us get the Christmas orders in,” he said, noting that 90 days would allow American firms to put goods afloat in time for the most important retail season of the year. “Otherwise, it’s going to be nuclear winter.” Joel B.

Title: Spin-Off Research Slashes Mural Oncology Valuation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2025/04/10/spin-off-research-slashes-mural-oncology-valuation/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T16:01:27Z

ByJoe Cornell ByJoe Cornell, Contributor. World Cancer Day Stories Template Flat Design Health care Illustration Editable of Square Background ... More for Social media, Greetings Card or Web Ads Mural Oncology (NASDAQ: MURA, $1.12, Market Capitalization $19.30 million), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on discovering and developing immunotherapies, provided an update on the Phase 3 ARTISTRY-7 trial of Nemvaleukin in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer (PROC). Based on overall survival data observed in the interim analysis, Mural halted the phase 3 ovarian cancer trial involving nemvaleukin alfa. (for more information, visit spinoffresearch.com). Given the setback, the market reacted negatively, and the stock nosedived ~71%. However, Nemvaleukin will continue to be evaluated in a potentially registrational phase 2 trial, ARTISTRY-6, cohort 2, in mucosal melanoma. The topline data readout is expected in 2Q25. Moreover, the preliminary data readouts for less-frequent intravenous dosing of nemvaleukin in patients with cutaneous melanoma are expected in 2Q25 for cohort 3 of ARTISTRY-6 (monotherapy) and in 2H25 for cohort 4 of ARTISTRY-6 (combination therapy), subject to patient enrolment. Mural Oncology Price Performance and Spin-Off Details Earlier in 4Q24, the Company expanded its pipeline by nominating two development candidates, one for its interleukin-18 (IL-18) program and another for its IL-12 program. MURA-8518 is designed to be a half life extended, binding protein-resistant IL-18 in order to overcome the native cytokine’s limitations as a therapeutic. Mural expects to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application or Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for a phase 1 trial of MURA-8518 in 4Q25. MURA-7012 is comprised of targeted split IL-12 sub-units that preferentially self-assemble at the tumor site and are designed to limit systemic exposure. Key Data MURA and Top 5 Shareholders Valuation and RecommendationOur fair value estimate for Mural Oncology is $2.75 per share (Previously: $12.00 per share), based on a terminal growth rate of 2% and WACC of 14.01%. The downgrade in our target price factors in the recent announcement of the termination of the Phase 3 trial of ARTISTRY-7. The trial investigated the efficacy of nemvaleukin alfa with Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK) Keytruda against chemotherapy for the treatment of platinumresistant ovarian cancer (PROC). The company stated that the combination therapy failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (the primary endpoint) compared to the standard of care, due to which the company’s potential for revenue has declined. Due to this, the stock took a significant hit and has fallen by ~71% since the announcement. Due to the termination of ARTISTRY-7 for ovarian cancer, the company now looks forward to a top-line data readout for ARTISTRY-6, cohort 2 in mucosal melanoma in 2Q25. Along with that, Nemvaleukin is also set for preliminary data readouts in 2Q25 for less-frequent intravenous dosing in ARTISTRY-6 cohort 3 and 2H25 for ARTISTRY 6 cohort 4, both targeting cutaneous melanoma. Mural also expanded its pipeline in 4Q24 by nominating two development candidates, named MURA-8518 and MURA- 7012. As of FY24, Mural Oncology has spent ~$607 million from FY21 to FY24, which implies the company is heavily investing in its pipeline drug, Nemvaleukin. Furthermore, the company stated that the current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $144.4 million are expected to fund its operations into 1Q26, and the company has not provided any updates on the new cash injection. As the bulk of cash would be used for operational purposes, we have assumed a net cash of $14 million (~10% of cash) in our DCF valuation model. In view of its high-risk business model and no further indication of cash injection or plans to raise capital, the stock offers an asymmetric binary payout depending on the success of ongoing trials on Nemvaleukin candidates for melanoma therapy. We maintain our ‘Long Term High Risk Buy’ rating on Mural Oncology Plc with an implied upside of 145.4% from the current market price of $1.12 as of 4/9. About the ARTISTRY-7 Trial ARTISTRY-7 was a phase 3 trial comparing nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab vs. investigator choice single-agent chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. This trial completed enrollment with 456 patients, and its primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). In the interim analysis of ARTISTRY-7, the safety profile was generally consistent with previously reported data. However, the Company noted that in the prespecified interim analysis conducted by the independent data monitoring committee, nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in overall survival versus the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy alone, and the company believed the study was highly unlikely to achieve success at the final analysis. Median overall survival was 10.1 months for patients treated with nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab and 9.8 months for patients treated with investigator’s choice chemotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.98). Next Steps & Milestones: Despite the ARTISTRY-7 trial setback, Mural Oncology has set several key milestones in its development trajectory over the next year.2Q25: Top-line data readout of Cohort 2 of ARTISTRY-6, Mural’s potentially registrational phase 2 trial of nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic mucosal melanoma previously treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Nemvaleukin has been granted an Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of mucosal melanoma.1H25: Preliminary data readout of Cohort 3 of ARTISTRY-6, an evaluation of a less frequent intravenous (LFIV) dose of nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with cutaneous melanoma. The company is conducting a trial to evaluate the activity and further characterize the safety of nemvaleukin with LFIV dosing in patients with cutaneous melanoma. 2H25: Preliminary data readout of Cohort 4 of ARTISTRY-6, an evaluation of an LFIV dose of nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with cutaneous melanoma.1H26: Submission of Investigational New Drug or Clinical Trial Application for a phase 1 trial of MURA-8518, its IL-18 development candidate. These milestones reflect Mural’s commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in oncology and advancing innovative immuno-oncology therapies. Financial & Market Outlook: • Mural Oncology is positioned to address large unmet medical needs in mucosal and cutaneous melanoma, which has limited therapeutic options. According to Bloomberg Intelligence report, the global market for melanoma drugs can reach nearly $11 billion in 2027 from $8 billion in 2023, and without risk adjustment for pipeline products and key line extensions, sales are projected to pass $12 billion by 2030. The company expects nemvaleukin to be a key asset for driving growth. • With an adequate cash runway into 1Q26, the company is well-positioned to continue its clinical development programs. At the end of FY24, the Company reported a cash balance is $144.4 million. 4Q24 & FY24 Results Review 4Q24 On 3/11, the company released its 4Q and FY24 results. For 4Q24, Research and Development (R&D) expenses were $28.7 million in 4Q24 compared to $42.2 million in 4Q23. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including a non-cash share-based employee compensation charge in 4Q23, as a result of the impact of the modification of share-based awards in connection with the separation from Alkermes. Moreover, the timing of patient enrolment in the ARTISTRY-7 trial and the winding down of the ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials during 2024 also contributed to the lower R&D expenses in 4Q24. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were $7.2 million in 4Q24 compared to $16.2 million in 4Q23. The decline in G&A expense was attributable to a decreased employee-related expenses compared to those previously allocated to Mural Oncology by Alkermes prior to the separation and to one time increases in employee-related expenses in 2023, including a non-cash share-based employee compensation charge in 4Q23 as a result of the impact of the modification of share based-awards in connection with the separation. Ultimately, the Company’s net loss declined to $34.3 million in 4Q24, compared to $59.5 million in 4Q23, which included the one-time charges of ~$11.7 million related to the separation from Alkermes and conversion of Alkermes employee equity awards into Mural equity. Although loss per share improved to $2.01 in 4Q24 compared to $3.57 in 4Q23, it was a miss as compared to the consensus estimate of $2.10 per share. FY24 Research and Development (R&D) expenses were $110.7 million in FY24 compared to $165.5 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee-related expenses compared to the personnel previously allocated to Mural by Alkermes prior to the separation. The decline in R&D expenses was due to decreased spending on the ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials as activities related to these trials wound down in 2023 and lower manufacturing spending on other programs. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were $27.6 million in FY24 compared to $30.7 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily attributable to lower employee-related expenses, partially offset by costs associated with operating as a standalone company after the Separation. Ultimately, the Company’s net loss declined to $128.5 million in FY24, compared to $207.4 million in FY23, which included one-time charges related to the separation from Alkermes and the conversion of Alkermes employee equity awards into Mural equity. Consequently, loss per share improved to $7.58 in FY24 compared to $12.43 in FY23. The cash balance at the end of FY24 was ~$144.4 million. Valuation In recent developments, MURA terminated the Phase 3 trial of ARTISTRY-7, the Nemvaleukin candidate for ovarian cancer. We have adjusted our model to factor in this development, and our revenue model is driven by Nemvaleukin’s ARTISTRY-6 cohort 2, cohort 3 and cohort 4 candidates, currently in potential registration, for the monotherapy of patients with mucosal & cutaneous melanoma. Mural expects topline readouts for ARTISTRY-6 cohort 2 in 2Q25 and preliminary data read-outs for ARTISTRY-6 cohort 3 and cohort 4 candidates for cutaneous melanoma in 2Q and 2H25. Mural also expanded its pipeline in 4Q24 by nominating two development candidates, named MURA-8518 and MURA-7012, designed to deliver a more sustained immune response and leverage native IL-12’s anti-tumor potency while mitigating its hallmark toxicity. With the ovarian cancer terminated, the company now majorly focuses on melanoma therapy. According to Bloomberg, the market for melanoma drugs can reach nearly $11 billion in 2027 from $8 billion in 2023. We estimate Nemvaleukin to achieve ~$40.2 million in net revenue by 2032 with ~0.5% market share. Intrinsic Valuation - Mural Oncology DCF Valuation - Using a discounted cash flow methodology, our fair value estimate for Mural Oncology stands at $2.75 (Previously: $12.00) per share. The downgrade in our target price factors in the recent announcement of the termination of the Phase 3 trial of ARTISTRY-7. Our DCF thesis assumes a terminal growth rate of 2%, WACC of 14.01% and a share count of 17.2 million. The company stated that the current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $144.4 million are expected to fund its operations into 1Q26, and the company has not provided any outlook on whether further cash will be injected. As the bulk of cash would be used for operational purposes, we have assumed a net cash of $14 million (~10% of cash) in our DCF valuation model. Our implied equity value for Mural Oncology stands at $47 million, which is mostly due to the present value of our estimated terminal cash flow at $26 million.Risk to Target Price/Valuation - For Mural Oncology, clinical outcomes from clinical trials, especially for products such as nemvaleukin, could impact how investors view its outlook. Company DescriptionMural Oncology Mural Oncology is leveraging its novel protein engineering platform to develop cytokine-based immunotherapies for cancer treatment. By combining its expertise in cytokine biology, immune cell modulation, and protein engineering platforms, MURA is developing medicines to deliver meaningful and clinical benefits to people with cancer. The company’s mission is to broaden the potential and reach of cytokine-based immunotherapies to improve the lives of patients. MURA’s lead candidate, nemvaleukin, is currently in potentially registrational trials in mucosal and cutaneous melanoma. Mural Oncology has its registered office in Dublin, Ireland, and its primary facilities in Waltham, Mass.

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%), Apple (AAPL+4.00%), Amazon (AMZN+1.90%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-0.59%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+5.21%), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC-1.85%), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR-0.16%), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA+2.68%). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%), Apple (AAPL+4.00%), Amazon (AMZN+1.90%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-0.59%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China.

Title: Recessions & Equities - What The Supposed Experts Aren’t Telling You

ByJohn Buckingham ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 09: CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon (L) speaks with Maria Bartiromo ... More (R) on "Mornings With Maria" at Fox Business Network Studios on April 09, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images) “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink explained at an event for the Economic Club of New York on April 7. “I think probably [a recession is] The JPMorgan Chase CEO added, “Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right. I think this time they are right because they’re just pricing uncertainty [at] the macro level and uncertainty [at] the micro level, at the actual company level, and then how it affects consumer sentiment. It’s hard to tell.” Goldman Sachs on April 6 raised its probability of a U.S. economic contraction in the next 12 months to 45%, up from 35%, as its economists cited policy uncertainty, foreign consumer boycotts and tighter financial conditions. Goldman’s odds surged to 65% on the morning of April 9, but the investment bank quickly revised that estimate back down to 45% after President Trump shocked the markets with a post on Truth Social: Based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Needless to say, economic forecasting is fraught with peril! Given that the tariff battle is far from over and President Trump also amped the levies on China on April 9, the odds of recession remain elevated. As a result, I continue to expect a steady stream of headlines warning that a slowdown in economic activity will drag down corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices. That seems logical in theory, but we think it important to investigate what has happened in practice. There have “only” been 15 economic recessions in the United States since 1927, which is how far back freely available equity return data exists. While the 16th may be imminent, the start and end dates are never known in advance. And contrary to current media proclamations, stocks have suffered only modest pullbacks, on average, during contractions and decent gains, again on average, in the year leading up to them. Equity Returns Before & During Recessions More importantly, investors in Value, Dividend, Large and Small Stocks have enjoyed fantastic average returns following the end of an economic contraction. Alas, they don’t ring a bell to mark the conclusion. As a result, those who somehow managed to avoid historically modest average losses during a recession likely sat on the sidelines waiting for an all-clear signal and missing a large part of the massive rallies. Equity Returns After Economic Recessions Irrespective of the giant near-3000-point rebound in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 9, I continue to think trying to outguess the economy is hardly a recipe for success. Yes, it would be nice to be find a reliable indicator that tells an investor when to get in and out of stocks, but I learned long ago that the only problem with market timing is getting the timing right. Russell Investments has done its own study of recessions and stocks going back further in time than mine. They have found: “The 15 recessions with negative returns lasted 17 months on average, with an annualized cumulative return of -14.8% and average GDP decline of -4.6%. The Great Depression from August 1929 through March 1933, a duration of 43 months, had a total U.S. stock return of -73.6% and was the worst economic downturn on record.” Of course, they have also learned: “There have been 16 recessions which had positive stock market returns—as measured from the start to the end of each recession. These positive-market recessions lasted on average 16 months, with stock returns ranging from 38.1% to 0.02%, with an annualized cumulative return of +9.8% and an average GDP decline of -2.7%.” Now all we need to know is if the next recession will see stocks have negative or positive returns and we will be set, though if a contraction began at the start of this month as Mr. Fink suggested, we have already endured a significant chunk of the average decline! ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Title: UK Crypto Market Heats Up: Best Altcoins to Surge After Kraken-Mastercard Partnership

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Kraken, the popular cryptocurrency platform, has partnered with MasterCard, which will allow users to spend their crypto assets, from established best altcoins to new meme coins, directly at more than 150M merchants. This partnership can be a historic move in the payment industry, as it will allow users to pay for real-world goods and services with their crypto holdings, just like they spend cash. Read on as we explore the specifics of this announcement and talk briefly about the UK’s changing relationship with crypto. We’ll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy now. Kraken plans to launch physical and digital debit cards in the weeks to come, which will help bridge the gap between everyday spending and the crypto economy. Crypto is transforming the payments industry, and we envision a future where global commerce and everyday payments are powered by crypto assets – David Ripley, Kraken Co-CEO This move comes after the launch of Crack and Pay in January – a feature powering borderless payments in 300+ cryptos. MasterCard also published a link where Kraken customers can join the waitlist for this new crypto payment offering. At a time when the US and other large economies have liberalized crypto regulation, the UK seems to be adopting a stricter approach. As per reports, the FCA wants to regulate activities such as stablecoin issuance, crypto lending, exchange activities, and payment services. Since 2020, only 14% of firms that have applied for mandatory registration have gotten the approval. Out of this, BlackRock is the latest addition to the FCA register. This decision also comes at a time when six UK digital economy trade bodies have written a letter to the UK Prime Minister to appoint a special team for crypto and digital asset regulation management in the country. Just like the US has done. The letter underlines that blockchain and crypto can add $73.6B to the UK economy in the next 10 years. Realizing this potential, the coalition suggests the creation of a detailed action plan, cross-sector collaboration, and informed decision-making. However, as more countries adopt the US approach of liberalizing cryptocurrencies, it’ll definitely mount pressure on the UK. Growing mainstream adoption will help the market rebound. It also presents retail investors like us with a great opportunity to invest in promising crypto assets. If you don’t know where to look, here are three suggestions. There’s little doubt over the fact that Bitcoin ($BTC) will receive the biggest push with the growing crypto adoption in the UK and worldwide. Also, with $BTC showing signs of a reversal (it’s taking support on the 50 EMA), the time is ripe to capitalize on the King Crypto. And BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might just be the best crypto to buy to rally alongside $BTC’s growth. It’s the ONLY crypto right now offering free (and real) $BTC to token holders. Now, the biggest reason we’re confident about BTC Bull Token following $BTC’s price is that the aforementioned airdrops will take place every time $BTC reaches a new milestone, such as $150K and $200K. Although this game plan already sounds like a surefire winner, the developers have further bolstered the token’s future by scheduling regular token burns. These will artificially contract the total supply, and as investors rush to grab the few remaining $BTCBULL tokens, their price will most likely see an uptick. In fact, our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that the token could climb as high as $0.0096 by the end of 2026. So, if you get in now (when the price is just $0.002455), you’ll be able to generate nearly 400% returns. The project has so far raised over $4.5M, and here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. The SUBBD platform is, quite frankly, a relief to the $85B subscription-based creator industry. Plus, with its native token, $SUBBD, it’s got a lot of perks to offer to fans as well. A huge reason we believe SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) has serious potential is how it plans to reduce the distance between the creators and their fans. With AI live streams, direct chat, and the ability to request personalized content, $SUBBD will help fans get closer to their favorite creators, which was the point all along. What’s more, as a $SUBBD token holder, you’ll also receive subscription discounts, loyalty rewards, and the earliest access to new platform features. You’ll get governance rights, too. This means you’ll be able to vote on matters, such as which features the developers should prioritize, which creators should/should not be onboarded, themes, etc. The best part? You can buy $SUBBD, one of the best new cryptocurrencies, for just $0.055125. That’s because the token is currently on presale. It’s, in fact, in its first presale stage, meaning this is the absolute cheapest you’ll get it for. And with $SUBBD price prediction targeting $0.668 by the end of 2026, early adopters may see a nearly 1,200% gain over the current price. In light of new crypto partnerships being forged and Trump finally agreeing to pause his reciprocal tariffs, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos. With full-blown degen energy backing this absurdly themed meme coin, it has jumped over 91% in the last seven days – and it’s up 202% in just the last month. Take that, crypto pessimists! What’s $FARTCOIN, you ask? Built on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin came into existence as a result of Elon Musk’s fascination with fart jokes. Currently trading at $0.6983, $FARTCOIN is in a pole position to rally higher. As crypto grows more legs with new partnerships and new markets being unlocked, the above-mentioned are the next crypto likely to explode. However, it’s important to remember that returns aren’t guaranteed. The crypto market does as it pleases, after all. With volatility being the main portfolio killer, make sure you don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.

Title: Trump’s Attack on ‘Woke Investing’ Is Silencing Climate-Conscious Shareholders

Time Published: 2025-04-10T15:10:03Z

Environmental-, social-, and governance-related shareholder proposals are down 34 percent this year as the Trump administration galvanizes the movement against âwoke investing,â according to an annual report by the shareholder advocacy groups As You Sow and Proxy Impact. The report counted 355 such proposals as of February 21, compared to 536 proposals filed by the same time last year. Wariness over anticipated changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission contributed to the decline, the authors said, as many investors opted to postpone resolutions until it became clear whether they would be blocked by new SEC leadership. âWeâre a little bit in a pause mode,â said Andy Behar, As You Sowâs CEO. He said a âright-wing crusadeâ against socially responsible investing has left shareholders in limbo as they figure out how to navigate the shifting political climate. The term ESG â shorthand for an investment approach that prioritizes environmental, social, and governance issues â dates to 2004 and doesnât have a fixed definition. Generally, it represents the idea that investors should buy shares in companies that factor social and environmental issues into their decision-making on the theory that such companies are more likely to prosper in the long run. Investors promote ESG principles via shareholder resolutions, brief proposals that are put up for a vote by everyone who owns stock in a company during their annual meeting. These resolutions typically ask a company to issue a report about how some aspect of its operations, like its greenhouse gas emissions, may affect the companyâs future profitability. All of the shareholder proposals submitted to a company during a given year are compiled into a âproxy statement,â and the time of year when voting occurs âÂ usually around May âÂ is called proxy season. Progressive critics of ESG have argued that the concept is so vague as to be meaningless and that exaggerated claims of corporate responsibility are a distraction from the systemic reforms needed to address societal problems. But the more aggressive criticism has come from the political right, which sees corporate diversity and environmental policies as âwokeâ interference with capitalism. These criticisms escalated during Joe Bidenâs administration. In 2022, red-state regulators began naming and shaming financial institutions for an alleged âboycottâ of fossil fuel companies and investigating big banks for their ESG practices. Last year, 17 red states passed legislation restricting corporate decision-making based on ESG priorities, and institutional investors like BlackRock grew more tepid in their support for ESG proposals. President Donald Trumpâs broad attacks on climate policy and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have further chilled ESG efforts, inspiring several major banks to withdraw from a climate initiative in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Experts quoted in the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report said government attempts to limit ESG investing amount to an attack on shareholdersâ right to make policy recommendations through proxy voting, guaranteed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. âAn anti-shareholder movement âÂ often mislabeled as âanti-ESGâ â is silencing the voice of everyday investors in the U.S.,â reads one statement from Rick Alexander, CEO of the nonprofit The Shareholder Commons. Behar said ESG opponents are unduly manipulating the market. âThey donât like capitalism, they donât like free markets, they donât like democracy,â he said. âThis is problematic for all the shareholders who are trying to keep our companies proceeding into the future.â Trumpâs reelection has also prompted changes at the SEC, the federal agency charged with protecting investors and enforcing laws against market manipulation. It normally has five commissioners, no more than three of whom may belong to the same political party, but two of its Democratic members voluntarily stepped down after Trump was elected, and their seats are currently vacant. Two of the three sitting commissioners â one Republican and one Democrat âÂ were nominated by Trump. The third, a Republican, was nominated by former president Joe Biden. In February â after the majority of the ESG shareholder resolutions included in the report had been filed â the SEC announced two new policies that complicated these resolutions and could make it more difficult to file resolutions next year. First, the agency placed tighter deadlines and more onerous reporting requirements on large investors asking companies to, for example, disclose their climate risks or boost gender equality on their boards. Second, the SEC made it easier for companies to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements if those proposals were deemed not âsignificantly relatedâ to their business. The SEC gave companies an extra opportunity to convince regulators to allow specific proposals to be excluded on the basis of this new policy, but it has not afforded investors a similar opportunity for additional explanation. âIt was clearly a biased decision stacked against shareholders,â said Michael Passoff, CEO of Proxy Impact and a co-author of the report. In light of the growing anti-ESG movement, Behar said some companies have grown more willing to engage in dialogue with investors, perhaps hoping to avoid the publicity generated by a proxy vote. This, he said, is how shareholder advocates prefer to make change âÂ by persuading companies to take action voluntarily in exchange for the withdrawal of a proposal. According to the report, 22 percent of ESG-related shareholder proposals were withdrawn as of February 21, compared to 7.7 percent at a similar time in 2024, suggesting that companies were negotiating behind the scenes with investors. However, companies have also been emboldened to ignore shareholder proposals. One way to measure this is by looking at the number of âno actionâ requests prompted by shareholder resolutions. These are requests companies make to the SEC asking for confirmation that the agency will not take action against them if they omit a proposal from their proxy statements. Even with fewer proposals filed as of early March this year, 221 had prompted no-action requests, compared to just 94 around the same time last year. While the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report identified fewer climate- and environment-related shareholder proposals filed this season, the nature of those that were filed did not change much from previous years. The largest chunk ask companies for information about the decarbonization strategies or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some new ones ask financial institutions to set investment ratio targets for clean energy infrastructure compared to fossil fuels; for insurance companies to report and reduce the climate pollution associated with their underwriting; and for mining companies to disclose their policies for deep-sea mining, in the absence of international rules governing this activity. Frances Fairhead-Stanova, a shareholder advocate for the environmentally responsible mutual fund Green Century Capital Management, said the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report raises concerns that affect many shareholders. However, she reported that the presidential election results and anticipated changes at the SEC did not prompt her organization to file fewer resolutions. She noticed more no-action requests, but said itâs unclear whether the SEC will grant a greater proportion of them compared to previous years. So far, Green Century has withdrawn 6 of the 27 climate- and environment-related resolutions it filed, in exchange for some sort of action or reporting. Starbucks, for example, agreed to share more information about its transition to reusable cups and to remove any recycling labels it deems misleading, following an internal assessment. TD Bank agreed to an audit of its board of governance policies with the aim of improving climate risk management. Five companies filed no-action requests, and the SEC has rejected two of these. The others are still pending. âWeâre not panicked about any changes,â Fairhead-Stanova said. âWe are just continuing to do our work.â This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/business/trump-climate-equity-esg-woke-investing-shareholder-resolutions/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

Title: More Microsoft job cuts could hit non-coding staff and middle managers
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107494-more-microsoft-job-cuts-could-hit-non-coding.html
Time Published: 2025-04-10T14:57:00Z

In brief: Microsoft is considering making more job cuts this year, adding to the performance-based layoffs and other terminations it has implemented in 2025 so far. The latest round could come as soon as May and will reportedly target managers and non-coding staff. Some Microsoft organizations are looking to increase their span of control, defined as the number of direct reports or subordinates a manager or supervisor oversees. It also wants to increase the number of coders compared to non-coders on projects, According to anonymous people familiar with the matter who spoke to Business Insider, Microsoft has yet to decide how many jobs will be cut, though one person said it could be a significant portion of their team. Other companies such as Amazon and Google are also reducing the number of managers and executives in their drive for efficiency. Microsoft wants to decrease the ratio of product/program managers (PMs) to engineers. Microsoft security boss Charlie Bell's division has a ratio of around 5.5 engineers to one PM, but he wants that to reach 10:1. News that Microsoft is targeting non-coders in these cuts is in contrast to the many stories about generative AI replacing the need for programmers. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott made the startling prediction last week that 95% of all code will be generated by AI by 2030. He added that humans would still be involved in the process, though it's easy to imagine that there will be fewer of them. At the start of the year, Microsoft confirmed it was implementing performance-based layoffs, though it said those let go would be replaced with new hires. Microsoft rates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 and bases their stock awards and bonuses on this rating. Anyone in the 60 to 80 range – 100 is average – is rated as a low performer. Soon after those performance cuts were revealed, the company said it was making more job cuts across its business, impacting employees in the gaming, experience & devices, sales, and security divisions. In other Microsoft news, the company this week terminated the employment of two engineers who protested against its AI-related contracts with the Israeli government.

Title: Italy's Prada Agrees To Buy Rival Versace For 1.25 Billion Euros

Italian fashion house Prada announced Thursday it had reached a deal with US group Capri Holdings to buy its flashy rival Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion). The acquisition will create a luxury group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with industry giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering, amid a slowdown in the sector worldwide. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada group chairman and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. Amid declining sales at the Milan-based label, it put Versace up for sale, and began exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella Versace, who turns 70 in May, is now the label's chief brand ambassador. Long journey While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's luster has waned in recent years. It posted $193 million in revenue in its fiscal 2025 third quarter, down 15 percent. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite the global slowdown in sales of luxury goods, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, with revenues up 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive officer, said on Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience. The evolution of a brand always needs time and constant focus," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. 'Complementary addition' The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio. It said Versace will "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity", while benefitting from Prada's "industrial capabilities, retail execution and operational expertise". The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. "Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life," Antonio Bandini Conti, a design consultant, told AFP. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shakes hands with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, in Panama City, Panama April 9, 2025. REUTERS/Aris Martinez U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an expanded partnership with Panama aimed at securing the Panama Canal against what he termed “China’s maligned influence” in the region. During a joint press conference with Panamanian Public Security Minister Frank Abrego, Hegseth declared that “The era of capitulating to coercion by the communist Chinese is over.” The announcement came during a three-day security conference in Panama City. The partnership includes a signed memorandum of understanding for cooperative security activities and an upcoming declaration specifically focused on canal security and operations. This new framework will provide U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels “first and free” passage through the canal. A key component of the agreement involves reestablishing American military presence at several former U.S. installations, including Rodman Naval Station, Howard Air Force Base, and Fort Sherman. Currently, the U.S. has deployed significant military assets to the region, including two guided-missile cruisers, a Coast Guard cutter, four F-18 fighter jets, and over 1,000 service members. The agreement follows President Trump’s controversial threats to “take back” the Panama Canal from Chinese influence—a claim strongly refuted by the Panamanian government. To address U.S. concerns, a consortium led by the American investment firm BlackRock reached a deal in March to acquire Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port operations at both ends of the canal, a move that Beijing has widely criticized. The deal has yet to close. Trump also previously criticized what he called “exorbitant tolls” charged for American ships, claiming the U.S. “foolishly gave away” the canal. The Panama Canal Authority confirmed the agreement in an official announcement highlighting that the declaration reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway and compliance with strict anti-discrimination requirements established by the 1977 Neutrality Treaty between Panama and the U.S. The agreement also includes provisions for developing compensation mechanisms for services provided to military vessels. The enhanced partnership extends beyond canal security to include joint efforts in combating regional criminal enterprises and border security. Notably, Panama has achieved a 99% reduction in illegal border crossings at the Darién Gap over the past year. The USNS Comfort, a U.S. Navy hospital ship, is scheduled to visit Panama this summer to provide medical care and strengthen bilateral relations.

Title: How CEOs Beat Trump on Tariffs
URL: https://time.com/7276408/how-ceos-beat-trump-on-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T14:40:29Z
Full Content:
It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs. Advertisement Advertisement While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation. In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

April 10, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global biopharmaceutical logistics market was valued at US$ 135.88 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 252.20 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.24% during the forecast period 2025-2033. The biopharmaceutical logistics market is undergoing rapid globalization, with manufacturers and logistics providers increasingly targeting high-growth regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. By 2024, India and China collectively account for 35% of global pharmaceutical production, leveraging their cost-efficient labor pools and pro-business regulatory reforms. Emerging markets now represent 45% of the $1.6 trillion global biopharma industry, according to IQVIA, but infrastructure bottlenecks—such as fragmented transport networks and unreliable cold chain storage—continue to hinder seamless operations. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market To address these challenges, multinational firms like UPS Healthcare and DHL Supply Chain are investing over $500 million annually in regional hubs, exemplified by Singapore’s Life Sciences & Healthcare Campus, which serves as a gateway to Southeast Asia. Cross-border trade agreements in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), are simplifying regulatory harmonization and slashing transit times by 20%. However, geopolitical tensions, including shipping disruptions in the Red Sea and U.S.-China trade friction, are forcing companies to adopt dual sourcing strategies for critical raw materials. Localized manufacturing via modular facilities, such as Samsung Biologics’ “Plug-and-Play” plants, is reducing dependence on centralized production hubs while accelerating market entry. Despite a projected CAGR of 7.24% through 2033, this globalization wave demands agile risk management frameworks to navigate trade volatility and ensure supply chain resilience. Key Findings in Biopharmaceutical Logistics Market Cold Chain Innovations Tackle Temperature Sensitivity of Advanced Therapies With biologics like mRNA vaccines and CAR-T cell therapies dominating 70% of the US$ 135.88 billion biopharmaceutical logistics market (2024), maintaining ultra-low temperatures has become a critical focus. Products such as CRISPR-based gene therapies require storage as low as -150°C, driving demand for cryogenic solutions like B Medical Systems’ nitrogen-powered containers. IoT-enabled sensors, including Controlant’s real-time monitoring devices, have reduced temperature deviations by 25% per WHO data, while blockchain platforms like MediLedger ensure tamper-proof documentation. Regulatory mandates, notably the EU’s revised GDP Annex 15, now enforce 99.99% temperature accuracy, catalyzing $3.2 billion in annual investments in cold chain infrastructure. Despite progress, 30% of global biopharma shipments still face delays due to underdeveloped airport cold rooms in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. Hybrid solutions combining passive cooling (e.g., WHO-certified insulated boxes) with active refrigeration are gaining traction, supported by initiatives like the USDA’s $2 billion cold chain initiative in India. Predictive analytics tools, such as Tive Solo, are cutting spoilage costs by $15 billion annually by forecasting risks like customs holdups or equipment failures. The rise of autologous therapies, which require patient-specific logistics, is further pushing the industry toward decentralized “just-in-time” delivery models—innovation that demands reconfigurable cold chain networks to balance speed and precision. Digitalization Unlocks End-to-End Visibility and Predictive Supply Chain Control Digital transformation has reshaped biopharmaceutical logistics market in 2024, with 80% of top-tier companies deploying AI-driven platforms to optimize decision-making. Tools like SAP Integrated Business Planning have slashed inventory waste by 18% through hyper-accurate demand forecasting, while machine learning algorithms from Blue Yonder improve route efficiency by 22%. Cloud-based transport management systems (TMS), such as Oracle’s platform, centralize data across 30+ supply chain touchpoints, reducing administrative overheads by $7 million annually per enterprise. Blockchain adoption is surging, with 60% of vaccine shipments now tracked via Hyperledger Fabric to combat counterfeiting and ensure compliance. Digital twins, which simulate supply chain disruptions, enabled Pfizer to reroute 30% of COVID-19 vaccine shipments faster during 2023’s Hurricane Ian. Nevertheless, fragmented legacy systems remain a hurdle for the biopharmaceutical logistics market: 40% of mid-sized biotechs still rely on manual Excel tracking, doubling error rates. Cybersecurity risks have also escalated, with attacks on shipment data rising 200% since 2022—pushing firms to adopt Zero Trust Architecture, a US$ 1.8 billion market by 2024. The integration of 5G-enabled IoT devices provides real-time monitoring of temperature-sensitive CRISPR therapies, ensuring sub-second response times to anomalies. With Astute Analytica estimating US$ 21.7 billion spent on digital logistics this year, the sector is racing to balance innovation with operational continuity. Serialization Mandates Reshape Compliance Amid Regulatory Fragmentation Global regulatory pressures are intensifying, with the FDA’s 2024 DSCSA deadline compelling 90% of U.S. pharma firms to adopt item-level serialization. Similarly, the EU’s Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) mandates tamper-proof packaging for 95% of biologics, costing manufacturers $5 million annually per product line. China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) now requires blockchain-based serialization in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, which has reduced counterfeit biologics by 40% since 2023. Aggregated systems like Systech’s UniSeries accelerate validation by enabling pallet-to-unit traceability, cutting compliance time by 50%. Interoperability gaps, however, persist: reconciling U.S. GS1 standards with China’s MMDS system adds $2.3 billion in annual costs in the market. Post-Brexit complexities, such as dual UK/EU labeling rules, have raised operational expenses by 18% for firms like AstraZeneca. To streamline compliance, 70% of companies now use AI-driven platforms like TrackTraceRX to automate 80% of documentation, while FDA warning letters for GDP non-compliance surged 35% in 2023 over storage validation lapses. Emerging markets in the biopharmaceutical logistics market like Brazil are tightening rules—Anvisa’s RDC 430 now mandates temperature data loggers for all cold chain shipments—forcing smaller logistics players to partner with tech providers. While organizations like PIC/S aim to harmonize regulations, slow progress continues to delay biologics’ time-to-market by 6–12 months. Personalized Medicine’s Rise Demands Precision Logistics Overhauls The US$ 82 billion personalized medicine market requires logistics networks tailored to therapies like CAR-T, which have a 72-hour viability window. AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier delivers over 300 CAR-T doses monthly via GPS-tracked, IoT-enabled shippers, while Cryoport’s nitrogen vapor systems maintain -170°C for stem cell therapies, achieving a 0.1% failure rate. However, 25% of apheresis centers lack same-day airport access, prompting DHL to deploy mobile collection units. Wherein, gene therapies pose unique hurdles to the biopharmaceutical logistics market: adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors degrade above -65°C, necessitating solutions like CSafe’s RKN shippers with proprietary phase-change materials. Real-time patient monitoring via CRISPR-based biosensors (e.g., NanoString) triggers dynamic routing for treatments like Vertex’s exa-cel sickle cell therapy. Decentralized clinical trials, now 45% of studies, require localized distribution across 50+ countries, pressuring firms like IQVIA to establish micro-fulfillment hubs. Payers are pushing back against logistics costs, which account for $500,000 per CAR-T dose, driving investments in scalable “hub-and-spoke” networks to cut last-mile expenses by 30%. With AI tools predicting patient adherence (e.g., Novo Nordisk’s Rybelsus® refill algorithms), the sector must align agility with affordability. Personalized medicine is projected to drive 65% of logistics investments through 2030, but only through hyper-specialized infrastructure can the industry meet this demand sustainably. Sustainability Gains Momentum with Green Logistics and Carbon-Neutral Transport Sustainability has become non-negotiable for biopharmaceutical logistics market, with supply chains contributing 8% of global CO2 emissions. Sixty percent of the top 50 firms now adhere to science-based targets (SBTi), committing to 45% emission cuts by 2030. DHL’s GoGreen Plus program offsets 30% of air freight emissions via sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) credits, while Pfizer’s EcoBox initiative eliminates 25 million pounds of annual waste through reusable packaging. Innovations like Sonoco Thermosafe’s eutectic phase-change materials reduce energy consumption by 40% compared to traditional refrigeration. Solar-powered warehouses, such as FedEx’s Los Angeles hub, cut facility emissions by 90%, and electric trucks like the Tesla Semi handle 20% of U.S. middle-mile distribution. Despite progress, 70% of shippers in the biopharmaceutical logistics market still use polystyrene coolants, which take 500+ years to decompose. Regulatory risks loom: EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) could penalize non-compliant firms up to $4 million annually. EcoVadis ratings now influence 35% of logistics contracts, compelling suppliers to adopt ISO 14001 standards. While SAF remains 300% costlier than conventional fuel, coalitions like ClearBlue aim for price parity by 2026. Investors are reinforcing this shift: BlackRock reports 99% of institutions prioritize ESG metrics in 2024, making green logistics a strategic imperative rather than an optional benchmark. View the Table of Contents to select and purchase individual chapters: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/toc/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market Urbanization and Patient-Centric Models Revolutionize Last-Mile Delivery Urbanization, with 68% of the global population in cities by 2024, has intensified demand for rapid, temperature-controlled last-mile delivery in the biopharmaceutical logistics market. Same-day service now covers 40% of critical biologics, led by Amazon Pharmacy and Capsule’s urban networks. In Rwanda, Zipline’s drones deliver 10,000+ vaccines daily, slashing transit times from 4 hours to 15 minutes. However, 60% of U.S. patients reside in “pharmacy deserts,” prompting Walgreens to deploy micro-fulfillment centers for extended reach. Precision temperature control is paramount: Tesla’s refrigerated vans maintain 2–8°C with 98% accuracy versus 85% for legacy fleets. Crowdsourced platforms like Uber Health reduce costs by 25%, but stolen oncology shipments rose 15% in 2023, underscoring security risks. Predictive routing via Locus Robotics cuts delivery times by 30%, though 50% of APAC countries lack standardized addressing systems for precision logistics. Patient-centric adherence tools, such as Phil’s GPS-enabled inhalers, automatically trigger refills, necessitating dynamic inventory management at UPS’s metropolitan hubs. Regulatory bottlenecks, including FAA restrictions on long-range drones, delay U.S. adoption of aerial delivery. Despite a projected $35 billion market for last-mile biopharma logistics in 2024, labor shortages—a 1.2 million driver deficit in the U.S.—and rising “clicks-to-bricks” returns (up 25%) challenge scalability, demanding smarter automation and workforce strategies. Climate and Geopolitical Risks Demand Proactive Supply Chain Mitigation Climate disasters cost the biopharmaceutical logistics market a US$12 billion in 2023, highlighted by Hurricane Fiona’s disruption of Puerto Rico’s pharma exports, which supply 10% of global APIs. Concurrently, geopolitical volatility, such as the Red Sea shipping crisis, extended lead times by 21 days, pushing 60% of firms to nearshore API production. Everstream Analytics’ AI-driven risk platforms now redirect 30% of shipments preemptively, while dual sourcing strategies—employed by Pfizer for lipid nanoparticle suppliers—cover 80% of critical materials versus 40% in 2021. Insurance costs have spiked 40% due to war exclusions, accelerating the shift to parametric models like Swiss Re’s NatCat for faster claims. The 2023 Phoenix city heatwave destroyed $150 million in insulin through temperature excursions, spurring adoption of climate-resilient packaging like Va-Q-tec’s PHCbi. Moreover, sanctions on Russian airspace forced reroutes via Kazakhstan, raising 2024 fuel costs by 18%. Post-pandemic buffer stockpiling costs $8 billion annually in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, even as firms pivot to multi-modal options—30% of temperature-sensitive cargo now moves via blockchain-secured rail (e.g., DB Schenker’s PharmaRail). Proactive risk management, now a $4.5 billion market, is no longer optional but a cornerstone of supply chain viability in an era of compounding disruptions. Future Outlook: AI, Circular Supply Chains, and Regionalization Redefine Logistics By 2033, AI will govern 50% of biopharmaceutical logistics market’s decisions, with generative models like GPT-5 automating 70% of customs paperwork. Autonomous robotics, including Boston Dynamics’ Stretch, will manage 30% of warehouses, achieving 99.9% picking accuracy. Apart from this, the circular economy will dominate, as 90% of packaging transitions to blockchain-tracked reusable loops, exemplified by Loop Industries’ partnership with GSK. Regionalized manufacturing, such as BioNTech’s mRNA “BioNTainer” facilities, will slash transport needs by 40%, while 4D-printed vaccines from MIT could eliminate cold chain dependencies. However, monopolization risks loom: Amazon, DHL, and UPS control 65% of the logistics market, prompting antitrust scrutiny. Space logistics partnerships, like SpaceX’s polar satellite launches, may expedite global distribution, while quantum computing could optimize routes in milliseconds.

April 10, 2025 10:10 ET | Source: Job&Talent Job&Talent MADRID, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Job&Talent, a world-leading marketplace for essential work and AI-powered workforce management provider, today announces the successful closing of its Series F fundraising round, securing EUR 92 million in equity financing to accelerate the next generation of workforce management. The round, which values the company at EUR 1.3 billion, included participation from new and existing investors such as Atomico, BlackRock, DN Capital, Hercules, Infravia, Kibo, and Kinnevik among others. This new funding will fuel Job&Talent’s long-term strategic goals, including accelerating international growth and major advances in AI-powered technology. The company will invest heavily in sales and product development, with a strong focus on expanding its AI capabilities to enhance workforce reliability and productivity for clients. As part of its innovation strategy, Job&Talent is developing a suite of AI agents, each designed to simplify and optimize a specific aspect of workforce management, supporting candidates, workers, and supervisors alike. These intelligent agents are trained using invaluable operational data from over 1 million worker placements and millions of logged shifts across the platform, including performance metrics, shift management, absenteeism, and more. The AI agents—whose expertise ranges from recruiter to account manager and attendance coach—work across text, voice, and video to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, as well as proactively supporting employers to hire more efficiently, manage their workforce with greater control, and significantly reduce operational costs. For example, agents can call unlimited candidates within minutes of application, anticipate staffing needs and automate shift planning, and proactively manage attendance by detecting no-shows in real-time. The first AI agent launched was Clara, Job&Talent’s recruitment agent. Currently being tested with select clients, Clara has already conducted over 180,000 interviews in just a few months, equivalent to the output of thousands of recruiters, and has directly contributed to more than 7,000 hires, helping deliver industry-leading fill rates, even during peak periods of demand. With multiple agents already in beta testing, the company plans to launch more agents throughout the year to address different areas of workforce management. This year, the company will also expand access to its platform and AI agents to include permanent workers, enabling companies to benefit from its capabilities and cost savings across their entire workforce — not just those staffed by Job&Talent. The rollout is starting with select existing clients and will be available to all companies in the second half of the year. With this expansion, Job&Talent extends its value proposition to the entire frontline workforce, offering companies the flexibility to seamlessly hire and manage both temporary and permanent workers through a single, integrated platform. Over the past two years, Job&Talent has successfully navigated a challenging macroeconomic environment by prioritizing profitability, operational efficiency, and product innovation. In 2024 alone, Job&Talent placed over 300,000 workers globally in more than 3,250 companies in key sectors such as logistics, warehousing, and retail. Since launching in 2021, the US has steadily grown to become Job&Talent’s largest and fastest-growing market, demonstrating a +27% YoY revenue increase in Q4 2024. This growth was driven by a nation-wide rollout of its technology-driven workforce management platform. Earlier this year, the company expanded platform availability to all 10 countries in which it operates, reinforcing its global footprint. Juan Urdiales, Co-Founder and Co-CEO at Job&Talent, said: “This capital injection reaffirms our shared vision for the future of Job&Talent. Thanks to the platform we have built over the past years, we are now well-positioned to evolve into a fully integrated employment platform that helps companies manage their temporary and internal workforces more efficiently. Our next-generation AI agents will bring major improvements in productivity, provide better opportunities for workers, and unlock crucial cost savings for companies.” MEDIA CONTACTKingsum LiSenior Manager, Global Communicationspress@jobandtalent.com ABOUT JOB&TALENTJob&Talent is a world-leading marketplace for essential work, matching great people with great companies directly through its platform.

Title: Lynx Equity: NVIDIA’s “Minimal-Tariff Status” Is A Win For Micron And Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares were brutally bruised in the recent tariff-related turmoil. However, now as President Trump seems to have stepped away from the proverbial precipice, Lynx Equity expects NVIDIA to promptly return to its recent highs, accruing outsized benefits for its key supply chain partners - the provider of high-performance memory and storage solutions, Micron, and the retailer of servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI). For the benefit of those who might not be aware, President Trump has now instituted a 10 percent baseline tariff for all major trading partners of the US except China, which is currently subjected to a 125 percent tariff. This situation is expected to persist for the next 90 days, during which the US now expects to conclude agreements with its major trading partners. Bear in mind that the tariffs on the import of vehicles and auto parts into the US persist at 25 percent, as do the import levies on aluminum and steel. For its part, China has imposed a tariff of 84 percent on all imports from the US. .@AnnaEconomist's work suggests roughly similar levels of tariffs under the new announcement. Certainly not looking like a big relief here. pic.twitter.com/C4sRzDv014 — Bob Elliott (@BobEUnlimited) April 10, 2025 Despite the prevailing euphoria, we note that the average tariff rate that the US applies to its imports has not decreased materially despite Trump's off-ramp. This is primarily due to the punitive levies that imports from China still remain subjected to. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA, "with its AI servers sourcing most components outside the US and assembled by system integrators based in Taiwan, has built a multi-layered strategy to avoid nearly all US tariffs." Moreover, the research house believes that China is unlikely to subject NVIDIA to punitive tariffs, "given China’s continued dependence on NVDA products." The firm goes on to note: "Due to tariff mitigation plans NVDA has in place, we are now calling for NVDA to return to recent highs, despite potential downside to data center capex expectations." Specifically, Lynx Equity believes that NVIDIA can viably reach a stock price target of $140, which corresponds to a multiple of 31x to the consensus EPS expectations for the calendar year 2025. Lynx Equity also believes that Micron and Super Micro Computer would accrue outsized benefits from NVIDIA's tariff mitigation strategy: "As part of the NVDA supply chain, we reiterate our preference for MU at $125 PT and SMCI at $60 PT." Finally, the research house also expects Dell to emerge as a relative winner in the prevailing situation. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

April 10, 2025 09:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Manufactures are projected to see increased manufacturing and sales in the global drone market for the coming several years. Rapid advancements in drone technology are significantly contributing to the drones market growth. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and improved sensor technology have enhanced the capabilities of drones, enabling them to perform more complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency. The integration of AI and ML, for instance, allows drones to analyze data in real-time, optimize flight paths, and make autonomous decisions. Furthermore, advancements in battery technology and propulsion systems have improved the endurance and range of drones, allowing them to operate for longer periods and cover greater distances. With the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly drones, market players are focusing on delivering drones with enhanced payload capacities, durability, and flight times. A report from Research And Markets said that the global drones market size aided by the increasing adoption of drones across various sectors, including agriculture, defense, logistics, and entertainment, the market is projected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 22.4% through 2032 to reach a value of USD 244.95 billion by 2032.” Active Companies in the drone industry today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), Safe Pro Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAI), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE: UAVS), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). The report said: “As per the global drones market analysis, the increasing interest in urban air mobility (UAM) and the potential for passenger drones and air taxis represent a transformative opportunity for the transportation sector. Several companies and startups are already developing drone-based urban transport solutions, which could redefine urban mobility and create new market segments in the coming years. In conclusion, the global drones market value is set to increase in the coming years, driven by advancements in technology, expanding applications, and increasing demand across a wide range of sectors. Despite facing regulatory challenges and high costs, the market is set to witness robust expansion as drones become an integral part of modern industries, from agriculture to logistics to entertainment. By 2032, the market is expected to achieve remarkable growth, providing numerous opportunities for innovation, investment, and development across the globe.” ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Closes Miller Land Surveying Corporation, a Third Southeast Acquisition and a Fourth Nationally for the Drone as Service (DaaS) Rollout - ZenaTech, Inc. (FSE: 49Q) (BMV: ZENA) ("ZenaTech"), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drone, Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS and Quantum Computing solutions, announces the closing of its acquisition of Miller Land Surveying Corporation (“Miller”) of Lake Worth, Florida, a land survey and mapping company with a 40 year history and deep portfolio of business customers in the Palm Beach County area of South Florida. This is ZenaTech’s third acquisition in the Southeast region as part of a larger national roll-up strategy to disrupt the land survey industry by accelerating the use of drones for their speed and accuracy benefits. The acquisition also furthers the Company’s national Drone as a Service, or DaaS, business rollout as the fourth US acquisition. “Miller Land Surveying brings a wealth of experience and customer relationships as a second-generation company known across Palm Beach County for quality land surveys and mapping. Their pioneering team is well suited to helping us bring drone innovation to premium residential and business land surveys. This acquisition is another step towards our vision to create a national DaaS business, bringing AI drone efficiencies and precision to a variety of legacy business verticals and manual tasks,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. ZenaTech’s DaaS business will incorporate the ZenaDrone 1000 and the IQ series of multifunction autonomous drones to provide a variety of service solutions from land surveys to power line inspections or power washing, made accessible and cost effective through an Uber-like business model on a regular subscription or pay-per-use basis. Customers can conveniently access drones for eliminating manual or time-consuming tasks achieving superior results, such as for surveying, inspections, security and law enforcement, or precision farming applications, without having to buy, operate, or maintain the drones themselves. The DaaS business model offers customers such as government agencies, real estate developers, construction firms, farmers or energy companies reduced upfront costs as there is no need to purchase expensive drones, as well as convenience, as there is no need to manage maintenance and operation. The model also offers scalability to use more often or less often based on business needs and enables access to advanced drone technology sensors or attachments like spraying, without the need for specialized training. Accurate land surveys are essential for the planning, designing, and executing of roads, bridges, and building projects for cities, commercial, and residential projects, and are required for legal purposes. Remotely piloted drones with an array of sensors and cameras, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and GPS systems for capturing high-resolution pictures and data are revolutionizing the land survey industry gathering aerial data across expansive terrains in a matter of hours instead of weeks or months using more traditional photogrammetry methods.

(“ZenaTech”), a technology company specializing in AI (Artificial Intelligence) drones, Drone as a Service (DaaS), enterprise SaaS and Quantum Computing solutions, today provides an update on its US-based ZenaDrone subsidiary’s expansion plans for “Made in America” manufacturing in light of the recent expanded tariffs announced by the current US Administration. ZenaTech maintains its commitment to domestic manufacturing for US defense drone solutions, including strategic local investments and military-compliant supply chains. ZenaDrone will now move some of its commercial drone production for US commercial customers to Arizona, meaning no need to increase prices for customers to offset tariff costs.

The company plans to expand its manufacturing capabilities over the next two months to produce drones for US commercial customers in addition to planned production for the US military. This expansion will include up to 2,000 additional square feet of production space. This will be the second global manufacturing facility; the company currently has development and production facilities for the ZenaDrone 1000 and IQ series of drones at its 10,000-square-foot facility in Sharjah, UAE. In response to the evolving trade landscape, ZenaTech also expects that the expansion of its Phoenix-based manufacturing facility will bring over 150 new jobs to the region by the end of 2026. “While tariffs can be challenging, they also reveal which companies are truly agile. ZenaTech has always been long-term in our thinking; engaging in smart resource management and supply chains and prepared to navigate global shifts,” said CEO Shaun Passley, Ph.D. “With increased US bans on Chinese drones and components and local incentives for domestic production, we are well-positioned to expand our manufacturing in Arizona, also creating more high-quality American jobs,” added Mr. Passley.

Title: Stock futures slide even as inflation cools. Tesla, Apple, and Amazon slip as bank earnings loom

Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day’s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report — offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday’s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+4.00%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-2.15%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA+0.06%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+1.95%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo’s (WFC-0.63%) numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock (BLK+3.01%) will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk — and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.05%) will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street’s current dealmaking drought.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+4.00%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-2.15%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA+0.06%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+1.95%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo’s (WFC-0.63%) numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock (BLK+3.01%) will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk — and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.05%) will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street’s current dealmaking drought.

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound yesterday after President Donald Trump abruptly delayed parts of his planned tariff rollout — pausing some retaliatory measures while reaffirming steep duties on Chinese EVs and tech imports. The 90-day pause, announced just hours before the tariffs were set to take effect, jolted stocks and rocked major indices. The about-face sparked a frenzied rebound, with the Nasdaq jumping 12.1% (its second-biggest gain on record) and the Dow surging more than 3,000 points for the first time in history. Early this morning, futures point lower, with the Nasdaq down 2%, the S&P 500 falling 1.8%, and the Dow off 1.4%. The whiplash signals investors are still weighing the implications of a tariff truce that arrived as abruptly as the policy itself — redirecting billions in market value overnight and igniting questions about how and why market-moving decisions are made. The Fear & Greed Index — which tracks market sentiment using indicators such as momentum, volatility, and demand for safe havens — jumped 14 points intraday yet remained in “Extreme Fear” territory. It was a move that suggested investors were trading the bounce, not buying the rally. The 90-day tariff pause also sent shockwaves beyond U.S. borders. Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged nearly 10%, marking one of its most significant gains in recent years. The European Union announced a corresponding 90-day delay in its planned retaliatory tariffs. Fresh CPI data released Thursday morning offered a dose of relief: Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March—the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+1.95%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6.0 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Carmax stock was down nearly 8% before market open. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment.

Wall Street staged a dramatic rebound Wednesday after President Donald Trump abruptly hit pause on sweeping tariffs for most countries. The 90-day delay — announced shortly after the duties took effect — whipsawed stocks and rocked major indices. But a little more than an hour before markets opened Thursday, stocks looked poised to slump again. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 537 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 futures were off 1.7% and Nasdaq futures were off 2.1%. After Trump announced the pause on Wednesday, the Nasdaq surged 12.1% — its second-biggest daly gain on record — while the Dow jumped more than 3,000 points for the first time in history, closing up 8%. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%. Some of the market’s most battered names led the charge, with Apple (AAPL+4.00%) stock rising 15%, both Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) and Intel (INTC-1.85%) jumping more than 18%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) rallying 23%. Meta (META-0.59%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) also logged double-digit gains, underscoring how sudden, top-down policy reversals don’t just move markets. They redistribute billions of dollars to those positioned — and in fact publicly encouraged — to capitalize. Here’s what to watch on Thursday. CarMax (KMX+1.95%) reports earnings Thursday morning, with analysts expecting earnings per share of $0.66 on $5.97 billion in revenue — up sharply from $0.32 per share a year ago. As the top U.S. used car seller, CarMax is a key gauge of consumer health. Used car sales straddle interest rates, credit access, and household budgets, making them a prime barometer of macro pressure. Softening demand or tighter lending could flag middle-class strain, especially among subprime buyers. And with CarMax offering in-house financing, any signs of rising delinquencies or tightened credit standards may echo the recessionary signals analysts fear could appear in bank earnings Friday. The first major financial firms to report, BlackRock (BLK+3.01%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+2.05%), will kick off bank earnings season Friday morning. BlackRock’s results are expected to shed light on investor risk appetite and ETF flow trends in a choppy bond market. That’s because few institutions offer a clearer window into where money is actually moving. BlackRock reflects bond market demand primarily through its fixed income fund flows. As the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion AUM, it runs a massive range of ETFs and mutual funds that track everything from short-term Treasuries to junk bonds. If investors are running from risk — or chasing yield — BlackRock’s books may demonstrate the shift. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, offers a read on the health of deal-making and IPO activity — both of which have slowed amid rising rates and global uncertainty. Together, the two are likely to set the tone for how Wall Street is navigating 2025’s volatile whiplash economy.

Rathi is the first FCA CEO to be granted another five years by the Treasury and will now have more time to execute his plans for the financial sector, including crypto. Under his leadership, the FCA has registered 51 crypto firms under their money laundering rules. Some of those firms include the likes of crypto and investment companies Coinbase, Revolut, eToro and most recently the largest asset manager BlackRock. "Rathi will lead the FCA as it continues to drive reform to make the U.K. the best place to do business by removing unnecessary, outdated and duplicate regulations - whilst ensuring consumers are protected from detriment and can be confident in markets," the post by the Treasury said on Thursday. The FCA is looking to establish a new crypto regime with a fresh authorization process by 2026. It intends to have papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and lending by early next year. The regime will go live after the final policy statements are published in 2026. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

Title: Blockchain: The Operating System For Global Finance

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Block chain network technology Blockchain infrastructure ↔ Traditional financeDigital assets ↔ Real-world usageStartups and protocols ↔ Institutional systems In November 2024, while crypto headlines fixated on volatility, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a €100 million digital bond on HSBC’s Orion platform—settling the same day using wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) tokens issued by the Banque de France. Days later, Goldman Sachs announced plans to spin out its GS DAP® blockchain platform into an industry-owned utility. Neither event made headlines, yet both signal a profound shift in global finance. These aren’t innovation lab pilots—they’re strategic moves by financial titans rebuilding the core infrastructure powering traditional finance. Blockchain isn’t disrupting Wall Street; it’s becoming its operating system. While headlines obsess over Bitcoin, the real shift is happening quietly. Institutions are laying tracks beneath the surface—moving trillions, settling trades, and weaving decentralization into the foundations of financial infrastructure. This is about the mechanics of how money moves—legacy systems controlled by intermediaries, burdened by high costs and delays, or blockchain rails enabling direct, peer-to-peer, atomic settlement. By embedding itself into the plumbing of global finance, blockchain is rewiring the system from within—driving the most significant transformation since electronic trading replaced floor brokers. Just as cloud computing became the invisible backbone of digital ecosystems, blockchain is rapidly becoming the core of global finance. That transformation is already shaping tomorrow’s winners and losers. Whether you're investing, leading a company, or building financial products, understanding the ecosystem is essential to smart decision-making. It comes down to grasping how these once-separate worlds are converging—and recognizing the key players making it all work. This isn’t theoretical. It’s actively reshaping competitive dynamics, creating new opportunities, and rendering old models obsolete. Once dismissed as speculative, blockchain is now a strategic priority for institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. Blockchain is quietly reengineering a financial system that supports more than $100 trillion in global capital markets and moves trillions daily. The shift has been deliberate and strategic—years in the making, but now rapidly gaining traction. What was once seen as a fringe experiment is now deeply embedded in traditional financial infrastructure. Institutions are embracing blockchain not for speculation but for cost savings through improved efficiency—streamlining operations, eliminating intermediaries through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and enabling atomic settlement. JPMorgan moves trillions via JPM Coin. BlackRock issues Bitcoin ETFs and integrates blockchain into its $10 trillion portfolio infrastructure. Goldman Sachs, once cautious, is now leaning in—expanding its digital assets desk and signaling that blockchain isn’t a side bet; it’s part of the long game. And rather than being sidelined, Visa and Mastercard are weaving blockchain into their payment systems—Visa alone processed billions of dollars in crypto transactions in 2024. This isn't capitulation—it's evolution. These giants are using blockchain to streamline systems, improve liquidity, and boost transparency. Still, some of the most transformative innovations are coming from agile startups—solving inefficiencies in payments, trading, and consumer incentives. The companies mentioned illustrate broader trends, not endorsements or prescribed winners. They offer a glimpse into a larger shift—one driven by thousands of startups, protocols, and infrastructure providers reshaping the foundation of global finance. Unlike traditional finance's siloed systems, blockchain is built for composability—where financial applications plug into one another like Lego bricks, driving rapid innovation and more connected services. This modular architecture enables developers to stack functions—trading, lending, staking, identity, settlement—into seamless user experiences. It’s most visible in DeFi, where protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Lido integrate natively, accelerating innovation without the friction of closed systems. But composability extends beyond DeFi. As tokenized assets, on-chain identity, and payment networks evolve, the same plug-and-play architecture is beginning to reshape how institutions build and deploy financial products and infrastructure. Composability doesn't just speed up product cycles—it unlocks entirely new value chains. A lending app can tap into yield protocols or tokenized collateral instantly—without the bottlenecks of backend integrations or clearinghouse approvals. In this emerging financial stack, the winners aren't just fast—they're interoperable. Concept of mobile payments. Wallet connected with mobile phone. The structural limitations of crypto as a medium of real-world payment have long hindered its adoption. Digital assets remained siloed in wallets and exchanges, cut off from everyday financial systems. But that barrier is starting to break down—not by replacing payment giants, but by building infrastructure that bridges the two worlds. In fact, payment giants like Mastercard and Visa have accelerator programs focused on integrating targeted crypto solutions that can plug into existing systems, creating corridors between traditional and decentralized financial systems. Hong Kong-based Aurum exemplifies this approach, enabling users to fund accounts with USDT and spend in local currencies. Its ecosystem offers bots, payment cards, staking, NFT licenses, and a Web3 wallet with low fees and cashback rewards. With $12M in funding, Aurum delivers institutional-grade trading and payment infrastructure powered by advanced AI, complementing traditional financial networks. Former Binance executive Bryan Benson now leads Aurum Exchange, bringing expertise in scaling crypto platforms across emerging markets. The endgame? A world where crypto wallets function seamlessly with traditional payment systems, making digital assets as spendable as cash—without friction. For decades, financial markets have been plagued by opacity, insider advantages, and inefficiencies. The blockchain era is changing that dynamic. Institutions like State Street ($43T AUM) and BNY Mellon ($46.7T in assets under custody), with their extensive trading operations and market influence, are already implementing blockchain-based trade settlement solutions, ensuring real-time transaction verification and eliminating counterparty risks. In the retail trading landscape, Spotware's cTrader stands as a notable example of transparency while delivering sophisticated trading infrastructure. Built on its Traders First™ principles, cTrader aims to establish high standards for fairness, transparency, and security—tackling long-standing industry challenges and helping to level the playing field for all participants. The platform's technology handles millions of transactions daily, connecting over 8 million traders and more than 250 brokers and prop firms to global markets. Specialized infrastructure providers power this shift—the hidden backbone behind evolving trading systems. These providers don't serve end users directly—they power those who do, underpinning the next generation of financial infrastructure. Fireblocks secures over $4 trillion in digital assets for institutions, ensuring transparent custody and seamless settlement. Chainlink delivers tamper-proof price data to more than 1,900 projects, forming the foundation of reliable price discovery. Circle's USDC moves across exchanges, wallets, and payment systems, enabling instant, transparent fund transfers. Together, these firms are becoming the "essential middleware" layer of global finance—quietly powering billions in daily activity. Beyond efficiency, blockchain is redefining who gets to participate in wealth creation. Blockchain’s most powerful shift may be this: turning real-world value into liquid, on-chain capital—making static assets move, trade, and work for more people than ever before. Tokenization is fast becoming the gateway to unlocking trillions in dormant capital. By converting assets like treasury bills, real estate, and private credit into blockchain-based tokens, platforms are transforming illiquid markets into accessible, tradable units. The impact? Fractional ownership, 24/7 settlement, and borderless access. Major asset managers such as Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and HSBC are leading this transformation by developing tokenized investment products. Their participation lends institutional credibility to this emerging market, much like ETFs did for equities decades ago. Similarly, financial institutions like JPMorgan and State Street are laying the groundwork to bring traditional assets on-chain, recognizing tokenization's far-reaching benefits. Tokenized assets are projected to reach $2 trillion by 2030, led by cash deposits, bonds, mutual funds, and loans. Their appeal? Mobility, real-time settlement, programmability, and transparency—infused into markets once defined by slow processes, siloed systems, and rigid structures. 8lends by Maclear exemplifies this trend, offering USDC-backed loans to vetted businesses, making passive investing more accessible. Their platform combines blockchain transparency with the familiarity of traditional finance, eliminating cumbersome procedures and accreditation requirements. Smart contracts automate the entire process, delivering predictable returns with complete on-chain visibility. This represents a foundational shift in financial infrastructure. Tokenization is not only expanding access to investment opportunities—it’s reducing friction, unlocking liquidity, and streamlining capital flows across the global economy. The future of finance won't be defined by crypto replacing banks or banks neutralizing crypto. It will emerge at their intersection—where the trust, scale, and regulatory expertise of traditional institutions fuse with the transparency, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. The boundary between these worlds isn't just blurring—it's beginning to vanish. Like the internet before it, blockchain is gradually disappearing into the background—becoming the invisible rails on which global finance runs. The future of money is being written in code. The biggest winners won't be those who merely accumulate tokens—but those who understand blockchain as foundational infrastructure. As blockchain dissolves into the conduits of global finance, it's becoming the architecture through which value will move, scale, and settle in the decade ahead.

Title: BlackRock Becomes Largest Investor In Adani Group's $750-Million Bond Issue

Full Content:
Funds managed by BlackRock, the global investment behemoth, emerged as the largest subscribers of the $750-million private bond issuance by the Adani Group. The US-based asset manager, overseeing $12 trillion in assets, has taken on one-third of the $750-million-issuance, which carries a tenure of 3-5 years, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. This investment comes at a time when Adani Group officials are under scrutiny following a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment in a bribery case in November last year. BlackRock's move marks its first private placement in India's infrastructure sector -- a segment the firm is increasingly bullish on. "Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts re-shape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink had stated in January 2024, following the company's $12.5-billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a major player in ports, power, and digital infrastructure. Aside from BlackRock, five other institutional investors -- primarily American and European -- also participated in the Adani Group's latest capital raise. These included funds managed by Sona Asset Management. The $750-million bond issue of Renew Exim DMCC, a wholly owned offshore entity of the Adani group promoter family, is to be used to finance acquisition of ITD Cementation and other growth avenues. The Adani Group views the entry of the world's largest investor as a strong vote of confidence, particularly at a time when its fundraising capabilities have been questioned due to the ongoing DOJ investigation. BlackRock's involvement also signals that it does not anticipate any significant operational disruptions for the conglomerate stemming from the legal proceedings. This marks the Adani Group's second private dollar bond issuance. In February, the group raised about $200 million for its Australian port operations. The latest raise -- almost four times larger -- is the most substantial since the DOJ indictment. The $750 million has been raised by Renew Exim, a private group-level entity, to finance the acquisition of ITD Cementation. Last year, the Adani Group announced the purchase of a 46.64 per cent stake in ITD Cementation for Rs 5,888.57 crore from its promoters, aiming to bolster its engineering capabilities in the infrastructure sector. Renew Exim has since acquired an additional 20.81 per cent through an open offer at Rs 400 per share. ITD Cementation, known for its work on key projects such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and ports in Tuticorin, Mundra, and Vizhinjam, is seen as a strategic asset for Adani's long-term infrastructure ambitions.

For example, META stock dropped more than 75% during the 2022 inflation shock, and fell by around 35% during the uncertainty of 2020. So, it’s not exactly a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how key stocks have performed during and after the last six market crashes. META’s stock price experienced a significant pullback, declining from nearly $740 in February to approximately $505 earlier this week. Subsequently, following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, the stock rallied to its current price of $585. For investors looking for a potentially more resilient and better-performing option, consider the Trefis High Quality portfolio. This strategy has delivered more than 75% returns since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. If you’re confident in the long-term potential of AI, Meta Platforms offers a compelling opportunity. Unlike companies that only build AI, Meta also implements it across billions of users. This gives Meta a unique edge in monetizing AI advances through advertising, content suggestions, and improved user experiences. With substantial investments in AI R&D and the largest social media user base globally, Meta is well-positioned to benefit from AI growth—no matter which specific technologies win out. Despite its advantages, investing in Meta involves risk. One concern is that Meta’s earnings could fall short, or its growth could decline from 20% to around 15% soon. This slowdown may stem from the broader economy, where businesses are likely to cut ad spending to conserve cash. Additionally, unknown or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock. As a result, investors should be ready for possible steep declines—up to 40%. Selling during such downturns could hurt long-term returns. Still, for those with a 3-5 year time horizon who can handle volatility, Meta’s current price levels might present a good entry point into AI. If you're interested in strategies to weather downturns and even benefit from them, you might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices), or speak with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets. Staying calm and strategic during market swings is often key to building substantial wealth. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

The US-based asset manager, overseeing $12 trillion in assets, has taken on one-third of the $750 million issuance, which carries a tenure of 3-5 years, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. This investment comes at a time when Adani Group officials are under scrutiny following a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment in a bribery case in November last year. BlackRock's move marks its first private placement in India's infrastructure sector, a segment the firm is increasingly bullish on. The $750 million has been raised by Renew Exim, a private group-level entity, to finance the acquisition of ITD Cementation. "Infrastructure is one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities, as a number of structural shifts re-shape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink had stated in January 2024, following the company's $12.5-billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a major player in ports, power, and digital infrastructure. Aside from BlackRock, five other institutional investors — primarily American and European — also participated in the Adani Group's latest capital raise. These included funds managed by Sona Asset Management. Asia shares jump after US stocks soared to historic gains on 90-day tariff pause The $750 million bond issue of Renew Exim DMCC, a wholly owned offshore entity of the Adani group promoter family, is to be used to finance acquisition of ITD Cementation and other growth avenues. The Adani Group views the entry of the world's largest investor as a strong vote of confidence, particularly at a time when its fundraising capabilities have been questioned due to the ongoing DOJ investigation. BlackRock's involvement also signals that it does not anticipate any significant operational disruptions for the conglomerate stemming from the legal proceedings. This marks the Adani Group's second private dollar bond issuance. In February, the group raised about $200 million for its Australian port operations. The latest raise, almost four times larger, is the most substantial since the DOJ indictment. Last year, the Adani Group announced the purchase of a 46.64 per cent stake in ITD Cementation for ₹5,888.57 crore from its promoters, aiming to bolster its engineering capabilities in the infrastructure sector. Renew Exim has since acquired an additional 20.81 per cent through an open offer at ₹400 per share. ITD Cementation, known for its work on key projects such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and ports in Tuticorin, Mundra, and Vizhinjam, is seen as a strategic asset for Adani's long-term infrastructure ambitions.

Title: SEC approves Ethereum ETF options trading – All details here

Assessing ETH’s next move amid options and staking speculations on spot ETH ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading for spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. The agency greenlighted options trading for BlackRock’s ETHA, Bitwise’s BITW, and Fidelity’s FETH. According to Nate Geraci of ETF Store, the update could attract more ETH investments. He noted, “SEC has approved options trading on spot eth ETFs…Like with BTC ETFs, expect to see a bunch of new launches from issuers.Covered call strategy ETH ETFs, buffer ETH ETFs, etc.” Despite the positive update, however, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart stated that the outcome was ‘100% expected’ because it was the deadline for the SEC decision. Simply put, ETH had priced in the outcome. But he added that staking on the products could be approved by early May or August, despite their October deadline. “Its possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.” Most experts expected staking approval to impact ETH demand and value more, especially from institutional investors seeking the extra 3% annual yield. In fact, some analysts believed that the lack of staking was partly to blame for spot ETH ETF’s lukewarm performance compared to BTC ETFs. Since their debut, the products have logged $2.3B in cumulative inflows. However, spot BTC ETFs recorded $35B in total inflows — that’s 17x time outperformance by BTC ETFs. That said, ETH jumped +10% from $1400 to $1600 on the 9th of April. This followed President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on various tariffs. Hence, the options’ approval wasn’t a key catalyst for the price upswing. Even so, there was a notable spike in market interest for the altcoin, as revealed by the new high in April’s Social Volume. Source: Santiment But the sentiment was still negative to drive a sustainable recovery for ETH. On the 4-hour price chart, ETH had a bullish RSI divergence, which could signal that a likely recovery was in sight. However, the momentum could only be confirmed if the On Balance Volume (OBV) cleared the overhead hurdle (trendline resistance). Source: ETH/USDT, TradingView In conclusion, ETH price could stall near 50EMA ($1600) in the short term, like it did in the past few days. However, a decisive move and improved trading volume above the hurdle could push it higher. But the long-term recovery might hinge on a positive macro shift and likely ETH ETF staking approval.

Title: Why 300 Companies Use This Startup’s AI To Slash Costs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/04/10/why-300-companies-use-this-startups-ai-to-slash-costs/

ByRashi Shrivastava andKatharine Schwab ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff andKatharine Schwab, Forbes Staff. Itwas 2016, and May Habib was in the most important meeting of her life. The Lebanese-Canadian entrepreneur had just moved to San Francisco from Dubai and was pitching Visa on her startup’s translation software. To have any chance at a Series A, she needed to land the deal—and fast. But Visa’s executives, who wanted to roll out a digital payment product in 40-plus languages, had only ever worked with human translators and didn’t understand how her software would integrate with theirs. So Habib, now 40, stepped up to a whiteboard and mapped it out. And when they discovered a gap, she and her cofounder, Waseem Alshikh, went back to their house-cum-office in the Mission District and cranked out a GitHub integration to fill it. Guerin Blask for forbes Visa became Habib’s first major enterprise client with a $126,000 contract soon after, and she raised $5 million a few months later. “You’re not selling your software, you’re selling a different way of doing things,” she says. That’s the conceit behind Writer, Habib’s artificial intelligence company, which has evolved dramatically since those early days. It now sells AI Studio, a Swiss Army knife suite of AI tools intended to expedite the corporate world’s many simple, but often tedious and expensive, menial tasks. For cosmetics giant L’Oréal, Writer drafted thousands of product description blurbs, for Uber hundreds of answers to frequently asked questions. Salesforce uses it to quickly gin up email and social media marketing campaigns. Those are just three of the 300 companies that pay—sometimes millions—to use Writer’s customizable AI apps to automate time-consuming everyday work. The enthusiastic embrace of enterprise has helped Writer, one of the sizzling startups featured on Forbes’ annual AI 50 list, raise some $320 million from top venture capitalists. Its November $200 million round valued the company at $1.9 billion; Habib retains an estima­ted 15% stake worth $285 million. Forbes At a time when so many companies are trying to figure out exactly how AI can help grow their business—and whether the investment is worth it—Writer’s customers are using its tools to cut costs in a material way. An AI executive at a top health product retailer says their team uses Writer’s AI to advertise on TikTok, Amazon and Walmart, which has generated $5 million in value annually between cost savings and new sales opportunities—a number they expect to balloon to $25 million in the next two years. Victoria’s Secret–owned lingerie brand AdoreMe used Writer’s AI to translate 2,900 product descriptions into Spanish as part of its expansion to Mexico, distilling a months-long process down to 10 days. “The ROI is screaming at you,” says Sandesh Patnam, mana­ging partner at private equity firm Premji Invest, who co-led Writer’s funding round last year. Such savings have spiked Writer’s net retention rate to a stunning 160%, indicating that customers end up expanding their contracts by 60% on average. Habib says 20 customers started with contracts between $200,000 and $300,000, quickly found new ways to use Writer’s tools and are now spending about $1 million each. A pitch deck from last fall shows it brought in $9.3 million in revenue in 2023 and was forecasting $28 million in revenue for 2024. Writer said the figures were inaccurate and declined to comment further, but shared that it currently has more than $50 million in signed contracts, which it projects will double to $100 million this year. Writer’s confidence stems from its newest product, “AI HQ,” which includes tools to build artificially intelligent agents that can perform a series of tasks that are typically part of the workflow of an actual job. A financial analyst, for instance, could create an agent that pulls data from earnings-call transcripts, analyzes it and emails a personalized version to their entire client list. No coding is required; you just explain in plain English the sequence of steps you want the agent to carry out and click a button. At an annual cost that can reach into the millions, Writer also provides more than 70 pregenera­ted apps and agents that clients can use immediately. “People don’t have to do the work,” Habib says. “They only have to build AI that does it for them.” Already, major customers like fintech Intuit ($16.3 billion in 2024 revenue) and homebuil­der Lennar (sales: $35.4 billion) are trying out Writer’s agent tools. Lennar CTO Scott Spradley says his team’s Writer agents have so far written thousands of email responses to inquiries from potential buyers, scheduling appointments to view the company’s thousands of homes and providing information like their price or location. “It’s driving volume, it’s driving activity, it’s creating better leads,” he says. It also heralds the beginning of a paradigm shift for businesses looking to shave labor costs. Why bother paying people to do what an AI agent can do equally well and faster? That’s the real opportunity for Writer and the rest of the $58 billion enterprise AI market. Habib is blunt about what this means for rank-and-file knowledge workers: “Ten percent of the headcount is going to be enough.” With the enterprise AI software market poised nearly to double to $114 billion by 2027, competition is stiff. Deep-pocketed OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised a collective $42 billion, sell bare-bones models that businesses can then use to build tools. But they typi­cally require a team of developers to calibrate, deploy and update. Writer’s tech is largely plug-and-play, with user-friendly drag-and-drop interfaces. It doesn’t require messing around with AI models or crafting the perfect prompt every time. “We make so much of the magic invisible for folks,” Habib says. It has done that by home-brewing the models that power AI Studio and AI HQ. That’s important for security: Client data is retrieved from dedicated servers and isn’t used to train models, mitigating concerns about sensitive information leaking. Writer’s models address another core concern businesses have with AI: its occasional tendency to make things up. Writer’s AIs pull data directly from customers’ documents, guaranteeing far fewer hallucinations, if less creativity. But who needs poetry when your AI is genera­ting market analysis? In a world in which OpenAI spent $100 million to train GPT-4, Writer is doing all this relatively cheaply. Its rival model cost just $700,000 to build. That’s far less even than DeepSeek, the Chinese company that upended the AI world by building a model that competes with OpenAI’s at a fraction of the cost. “DeepSeek made efficiency cool, but Writer has been doing it for years,” says Rob Toews, a Writer board member and partner at Toronto-based VC shop Radical Ventures, which is an investor. Not everyone is sold. Some industry experts are unsure whether Wri­ter’s models can keep up with the giants. On popular leaderboards, which rank models based on how well they answer a host of questions, Writer trails AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic, whose revenue is in the billions. OpenAI has 2 million paying users for ChatGPT Enterprise, and Anthropic reportedly projects it will grow to $34.5 billion in revenue by 2027, two-thirds of which will come from enterprise users. “Writer’s great strength has been evangelizing what they’re doing. I think the challenge is making sure the technology can live up to that,” says one venture capitalist who has invested in other enterprise AI companies. Writer trained its own models (named Palmyra after the ancient Syrian city) even though everyone advised them against it. “You don't need to play by the rules all the time," says CTO Waseem Alshik." Habib is confident it can. Companies care more about real-world performance than benchmark horse races. And with a client roster that already includes blue-chip outfits like Accenture, Hilton, Spotify and Qualcomm, Writer’s investors are happy to continue betting on her. “She just can run through walls and make the impossible happen,” Toews says. Even VCs who passed on the last round speak admiringly of her. “She’s just kind of a force of nature,” says one. Entrepreneurship runs in the family, says Habib, who grew up in a tiny village on the war-torn border of Lebanon and Syria. Her father started his own tool-and-die shop, while her mother worked at a pita bakery. The eldest of eight siblings, Habib was managing the family checkbook by age 9. Her family fled the civil war to Canada in 1990, and Habib, the only one in her family who spoke English, graduated from Harvard in 2007 with a degree in economics and a minor in Eastern languages. While working as an investment banker in Dubai, she met Alshikh, 40, a Syrian technol­ogy executive who had taught himself to speak English so he could learn to code. Alshikh’s first company, which converted satellite photos into digital maps for cars, was taken over by the Syrian government because it thought he wasn’t “patriotic” enough, he says; in retaliation, he claims he hacked into the government’s servers to shut down the internet in the country. The duo launched the first iteration of Writer in 2015 as machine translation company Qordoba, before pivo­ting to build AI that could generate content in a company’s style and tone, relaunching as Writer in 2020. Twitter became one of its first customers, using Writer’s system to pump out blog posts. (After Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he stopped paying; Writer sued and eventually got 95% of what it was owed. X, as Twitter is now known, did not respond to a request for comment.) Habib jokes that Writer has evolved into a different company every four to six months to stay relevant. “We are the Eras Tour of generative AI,” she says, nodding to Taylor Swift’s career-timeline concerts. “We extract the rate of change for companies that can’t get their heads around it on their own.” It’s fitting, then, that the next stage of Writer’s business involves an entirely new approach to AI. Alshikh calls it “self-evolving.” His team is building models that learn from mistakes automatically, without needing a human to correct them. “It’s like hiring smart people in your companies,” he says. “You expect them over time to know more and learn more.” For Habib, this means new possibilities, and she can’t wait to get in the room with her customers to sketch them out together. “Even now, the team knows there has to be a whiteboard,” she says. “I can’t co-think or co-create with a customer without trying to imagine something that doesn’t exist.” Additional reporting by Richard Nieva.

April 10, 2025 04:58 ET | Source: BlocScale BlocScale LIJA, Malta, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlocScale Launchpad is rewriting the narrative for the XRP Ledger, bringing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to life while quickly establishing itself as the go-to launchpad platform for Web3 projects and businesses across emerging markets. As of March 2025, BlocScale has successfully raised over 14,000 XRP, surpassing its seed sale soft cap and capturing significant attention from the broader crypto community. With over 35% of its $BLOC Seed allocation already claimed, investors are positioning themselves early for what is shaping up to be one of the most critical infrastructure platforms on XRPL. PARTICIPATE IN $BLOC SEED SALE XRP Ledger Finally Enters the Real-World Tokenization Era For years, the XRP Ledger has been hailed for its speed, cost-efficiency, and enterprise-grade performance. However, one major gap has lingered—its lack of a native, decentralized launchpad capable of onboarding real-world businesses and tokenizing physical assets such as real estate, equity, and commodities. BlocScale Fills That Gap. BlocScale enables entrepreneurs, startups, and traditional businesses to tokenize real-world assets directly on XRPL. By using XRP’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) and trustline system, BlocScale offers a fully compliant, fast, and secure path to bring real-world assets on-chain. This innovation not only enhances capital access for businesses but also unlocks global investment opportunities through fractional ownership. Why Early Market Share Matters The market for real-world asset tokenization is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming years. Institutional players like BlackRock and JPMorgan have already made headlines exploring RWA tokenization. BlocScale is strategically positioned to dominate this niche on XRPL by being the first launchpad to actively facilitate these offerings. Capturing early market share in this space means BlocScale isn’t just a participant in XRPL’s growth—it’s helping to define the next chapter of blockchain utility on the ledger. JOIN $BLOC SEED SALE Growing Investor Confidence in $BLOC The rapid pace at which BlocScale’s $BLOC token seed round is progressing is a testament to investor belief in the platform’s mission. After a fully sold-out private sale, the current seed sale offers a chance to acquire $BLOC tokens at favorable rates before major exchange listings. $BLOC Seed Sale Details: Visit $BLOC Seed Sale Portal to purchase $BLOC tokens: https://www.blocscale.com/blocsale By holding $BLOC, investors gain access to project sales on BlocScale and can participate in future governance votes, including which projects get listed and what direction the platform takes.

Title: Is the U.S. already in a recession? A closer examination (Prakash Bhudia)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28261/is-the-us-already-in-a-recession-a-closer-examination
Time Published: 2025-04-10T08:19:27Z
Full Content:
Economic discussions in the United States have increasingly revolved around one pivotal question: Are we already experiencing a recession or merely bracing for a downturn that has yet to emerge fully? Shifting corporate sentiment, considerable market volatility and ongoing trade disputes have all contributed to the conversation. Below is an in-depth look at several indicators-particularly the current tariff environment- that may be setting the stage for a potential economic downturn. President Trump’s tariffs are at the forefront. They were introduced to strengthen domestic industries and reduce trade imbalances. While those objectives remain a primary justification, the prevailing impact has been growing uncertainty among investors and heightened tensions in global commerce. These developments have led many analysts to question whether tariff policies might be hastening a slowdown by disrupting supply chains, raising production costs, and deterring new investments. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, garnered significant attention when he remarked that the United States may already be in the initial stages of a recession. He is not the only influential figure raising concerns. A recent CNBC survey found that approximately 69% of CEOs believe a recession is underway or imminent. In tandem, Goldman Sachs has increased its estimate of a U.S. recession’s likelihood from 35% to 45% within one week, reflecting the speed at which sentiment can shift. Source: LSEG Although the conventional definition of a recession hinges on two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, several warning signs suggest a broader economic slowdown could already be taking shape. These include weaker consumer confidence, hiring slowdowns, and more cautious corporate spending. While none of these indicators definitively establish recessionary conditions, their combination may signal that the economy is losing momentum. A global shadow: The worldwide effect Although the U.S. economy draws the most scrutiny, the effects of current trade policies extend far beyond American borders. Several key trading partners, including China and the European Union, have implemented countermeasures, magnifying the strain on international supply networks. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that escalating trade frictions may squeeze consumers further, particularly if retaliatory tariffs lead to higher prices on imported goods. A downturn in U.S. consumer spending could in turn affect industries worldwide, underscoring the risk of a broader global slowdown. In evaluating scenarios for the near future, one possibility involves a more substantial decline in equity markets, potentially in the range of the 20% drop that Larry Fink recently mentioned. Though a retrenchment of this magnitude is understandably alarming, it could be consistent with historical correction patterns observed during the late stages of an economic cycle. Should the economy weaken further, the Federal Reserve may accelerate its use of interest rate cuts to encourage lending and purchasing activity. Indeed, some forecasts suggest multiple rate reductions by 2025 to mitigate the intensity of any recessionary forces. However, these actions can also indicate a recognition that underlying economic fundamentals are required, particularly if trade tensions and market volatility persist. Source: LSEG The Aftermath: Recovery and Renewed Growth Historically, periods of recession, no matter how severe, have eventually transitioned into expansion phases. Typically, such recoveries are driven by renewed confidence, adjusted monetary and fiscal policies, and technological advances. Today, resolving at least the easing of trade conflicts remains pivotal in stabilizing business confidence and investment flows. Encouraging signs include negotiated settlements or diplomatic efforts that reduce tariffs and clarify international trading rules. According to experts, the signs are there. Traders must stay informed and flexible as the market reacts to economic signals. The volatility of the next few weeks could be challenging, but it also presents opportunities as currencies and assets fluctuate. If the dollar continues to lose its strength, it could significantly shift the global currency landscape if other economies recover before the U.S. does. At the time of writing, EURUSD is inching up as the Euro gains on the dollar. The daily chart has some upward pressure bias as prices remain above the moving average. However, prices inching toward the upper Bollinger band hints at overbought conditions. Key levels to watch on the upside are $1.1057 and $1.1148, while on the downside, the levels to watch are $1.0891 and $1.0796.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Freeze: What Could Have Happened if They Stayed in Place?

Highlights Trump's temporary freeze on reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, provided short-term market relief, prompting a 2,200-point surge in the Dow Jones. Had tariffs remained, businesses such as Walmart, Target, PepsiCo and smaller retailers anticipated significant price increases and supply chain disruptions across groceries, clothing and electronics. Economists estimated that sustained tariffs could have raised consumer prices substantially, reduced annual GDP growth by approximately 0.6% and cost the economy between $80 billion and $110 billion per year. Hate to say you read it here first, but here’s a prescient quote left on the cutting room floor from PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster’s interview with QED Investors partner Amias Gerety just two days ago: “Because this is a self-inflicted economic wound, we get an extra dollop of uncertainty. Trump could reverse all of these tomorrow.” He waited until the day after tomorrow. On Wednesday (April 9) Trump announced a temporary suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most countries, reducing rates to a universal 10%. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were escalated to a staggering 125%, citing China’s “disrespect” toward global markets. This sharp increase followed China’s retaliatory tariffs earlier in the week, intensifying trade tensions between the two countries. The pause provided temporary relief to many industries and market, as seen in the Dow Jones surge by nearly 2,200 points. However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications. The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time. Had the tariffs remained in place, companies across various sectors were poised to pass increased costs onto consumers. Grocery chains like Morton Williams anticipated price hikes of up to 20% on imported items such as olive oil and canned tuna due to tariff impacts. Retailers like Target had already adjusted their inventory strategies earlier in the year to mitigate immediate price shocks but warned of steep increases for perishable goods like fresh produce within weeks. Similarly, manufacturers reliant on imported components faced significant challenges. PepsiCo noted declining snack sales due to inflationary pressures even before the tariff announcements. If sustained, higher tariffs could have exacerbated these trends, forcing companies to shrink product sizes (shrinkflation) or reduce offerings altogether. For smaller businesses with limited capacity to absorb costs, the effects would have been even more pronounced. Independent grocery stores and smaller manufacturers often adjust prices faster than larger corporations due to lower inventory levels. These dynamics highlight how prolonged tariffs, if they return, could disproportionately impact smaller players in the market. A PYMNTS report released earlier this week showed “about half of SMBs rely on immediate sales or existing cash for survival, with business credit cards — which are not a working capital solution — being the most common form of financing for those with access,” PYMNTS wrote recently. ”SMBs with access to some method of financing demonstrate greater confidence in navigating economic challenges.” The challenges extend to middle-market companies where — per additional PYMNTS Intelligence research — 60% of CFOs expect the tariffs to bring about additional economic uncertainty and planning challenges. The research also found that almost 70% of finance chiefs foresee supply shortages and product delays, with a similar share executing new costs to restructure their supply chains. Experts agree that if tariffs had stayed in place, consumers would have faced significant price increases across various sectors: Groceries: Yale University’s Budget Lab estimated food prices would rise by 2.8% overall, with fresh produce increasing by 4%. Lower-income households would bear the brunt of these hikes as they allocate a larger share of their income to essentials. Clothing: Apparel prices were expected to climb within three to six months due to higher costs for imported textiles and manufacturing inputs. Back-to-school shopping could have become notably more expensive. Electronics: Items like smartphones and laptops, which are heavily reliant on China-manufactured components, would likely see steep price hikes under the 125% tariff rate, which is still in place. Although it has become something of an internet meme, the exponential increases in iPhone prices if they were manufactured in the U.S. is an example. These increases would not only strain household budgets but also contribute to broader inflationary pressures. Economists warned that sustained tariffs could reduce GDP growth by 0.6% annually and cost the economy $80–110 billion per year. Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday in an interview with CBS News that Chinese tariffs could create a “category 5 price storm” for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of “flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,” he added. The temporary freeze has reignited debates on how tariffs should be handled moving forward. Gina Bolvin of Bolvin Wealth Management emphasized that clarity in trade policy is essential for market stability. She described the pause as a “pivotal moment” but cautioned against celebrating prematurely given ongoing uncertainties. Bolvin said the timing also “couldn’t be better” given major financial institutions including Bank of New York Mellon, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday. “This pause may provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,” Bolvin added. John Canavan from Oxford Economics noted that unilateral tariff policies create significant risks for global commerce. He advocated for negotiated agreements rather than abrupt policy shifts that destabilize markets. “There have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,” Canavan said. “Given what’s been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.” Other developments before the tariff reversal showed how companies were prepared to deal not only with increased costs but from the uncertainty of the tariff drama. New tariffs on low-value packages from China could hinder the plans of Shein and Temu. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 8), the White House has upped duties on those packages to 90% of their value, or a flat fee of $75 that would increase to $150. The duty goes into effect May 2, with the flat-fee hike happening after June 1. The shift follows Trump’s closing of a loophole that allowed Chinese imports under the “de minimis” threshold of $800 to arrive duty-free. Walmart announced it was pulling its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. “The range of outcomes for Q1 operating income growth has widened due to less favorable category mix, higher casualty claims expense and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented,” the retail giant said in a news release Wednesday. Walmart had forecast operating income of 0.5% to 2% for the first quarter when it released fourth-quarter earnings result in February. The company is scheduled to release its full earnings May 15. Walmart said it expects first-quarter sales growth to be in line with a 3% to 4% outlook, with annual sales and operating income growth guidance unchanged, per the release, timed to coincide with the company’s Investment Community Meeting. Thousands of Canadian autoworkers were furloughed before the tariffs were rolled back. Now, Canada’s largest private-sector union is warning these temporary layoffs could be the beginning of larger troubles for the sector, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs,” Unifor President Lana Payne said, per the report. “The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see. My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” Around 6,000 Unifor members were laid off temporarily after Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on most countries, the report said. The bulk of those notices went to workers at a Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, and which shut down for two weeks as the carmaker examines the impact of the tariffs, according to the report. Amazon reportedly canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries. The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen. It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments. About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Title: Potential buyers are probing Yahoo’s ad tech assets

Time Published: 2025-04-10T04:01:00Z

Yahoo has held preliminary talks with investment banks and potential buyers of its demand-side platform, according to sources familiar with the developments. Yahoo officially turned 30 last month, and in its trailblazing pomp of the 1990s and early 2000s, it was known as “the gateway to the internet.” However, in recent years, its various owners and leadership teams have had different ideas on monetizing its assets. Under its current ownership, Apollo Global Management – the private equity giant that took over Yahoo in 2021 – this could include a future without ad tech assets, with suitors inquiring about its DSP in recent weeks. While the latest developments do not amount to a formal sales process — Digiday understands all such recent discussions have resulted from inbound inquiries — they indicate an appetite for further ad tech consolidation. Four separate sources, all of whom requested anonymity to maintain relationships, told Digiday Yahoo had contemplated the prospect of a potential sale of its DSP for some time, even if this was just a case of scenario planning. However, since the start of early 2025, speculation over such divestiture has become more palpable, with two separate sources informing Digiday that investment bankers have been jockeying to engineer such a deal. One source told Digiday that preliminary discussions with a competitive DSP – the source declined to name this party – took place in recent weeks, although such talks are understood to have since ceased. When Digiday approached them for comment, spokespeople for Apollo Global Management and Yahoo declined to comment on the record about such assertions. When Apollo Global paid U.S. telco Verizon $5 billion to take ownership of Yahoo in 2021, it inherited a full suite of ad tech tools. However, it has since significantly reduced such interests, including the 2023 closure of its supply-side platform, a process that involved significant layoffs. Instead, Yahoo has inked a long-term partnership with Taboola, whereby the latter party powers native advertising across Yahoo’s digital properties. More recently, Yahoo appears to have doubled down on its efforts to monetize its remaining ad tech asset, inking partnerships with Kroger, being first to market with transparency standards and placing it front-and-center of sales pitches at major trade shows. It is difficult to officially rank the industry’s top DSPs primarily because Google (the widely presumed market leader) doesn’t break out DV360’s earnings, although it is understood to be a “tier one” player along with The Trade Desk and Amazon. Yahoo is understood to be among the chasing pack – also in this cohort are players such as Adform, MediaMath, Nexxen, Quantcast, StackAdapt, Viant and Xandr – with its DSP understood to be growing in stature. Advertiser Perceptions data recently shared with Digiday suggests media buyers are increasingly eager to diversify the number of DSPs they work with, and many are eager to reduce their reliance on Big Tech offerings. Robert Webster, founder and CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, told Digiday the Yahoo DSP is widely regarded as one of the best independent “feature-led DSPs.” He added, “If you look at it, for the first time in 10 years, the market is wide open… the DSP space is going to be transformed by AI in the next two years.” Sources consulted by Digiday claimed the most likely parties interested in the Yahoo DSP would either be competitors attempting to gain market share through consolidation or strategic players, such as a retail media network eager to add a buying tool to its stack. LUMA Partners CEO Terence Kawaja noted how mergers between sector rivals are rare occurrences, although he did note that much of the recent M&A activity in the space was driven by strategic acquirers. “All of the trends that drove that activity persist,” he added. “We still have the need for third- and first-party data… while the green shoots of AI and CTV also persist.” One anonymous source with knowledge of the developments said it was unlikely that another PE firm would buy the DSP without the data assets made available via Yahoo’s portfolio of web properties. “There’s probably not enough profitability for a PE to be that interested unless there’s a clear way of making cash, and if there was, then Apollo would have squeezed it out already, so it’s a tricky one,” added the source. Speaking with Digiday on the publication of LUMA Partners’ Q1 2025 market report, Conor McKenna, a partner at the investment bank, observed how T-Mobile’s ad tech acquisitions and Braze’s first scaled deal were notable throughout the period. He added, “Google announced a huge [$32 billion] deal [to buy Wiz],” he said, noting how this was the first such deal from a Big Tech player in some time. “I would interpret it as the expectation of a more conciliatory regulatory environment where they can potentially get big deals done.” However, given the current market uncertainty over the potential impact of tariff policies from the current U.S. administration, deal flow may be stalled in the coming months, according to LUMA Partners’s assessment. “Right now, we don’t know if that’s going to be a macro shock,” observed McKenna. “Right now, all we know is that there’s macro uncertainty.” Why companies would and wouldn’t want to buy a rising star in ad tech. All the holding companies have been interrogated as a result of guidelines that were issued by the ad agency association as well as the broadcasters’ association. What’s unclear is what Indian authorities are looking for. Some media agencies are reconsidering the ways they invest media budgets, and focusing on direct deals and curation to drive efficiencies.

Title: These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Silicon Valley leaders donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign or inaugural fund. They visited him at Mar-a-Lago and sat front-and-center as he was sworn into office. But in the first three months of his presidency, their wallets have taken a hit from his policies. The companies founded or run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have cumulatively lost nearly $1.8 trillion in value since the start of this year, even after markets rebounded Wednesday in response to Trump’s pause on many planned tariffs. As a result, the personal wealth of those leaders has shrunk, too. Tech’s top brass almost certainly hoped to gain some business benefits by hitching their wagons to Trump’s — such as fewer regulations or reduced antitrust pressure. And Trump has been eager to expand the tech industry’s US footprint and cement America as a leader in artificial intelligence. But the losses across Big Tech indicate that Silicon Valley will also face a slew of new challenges in the wake of uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans, which heavily target supply chains in Asia where tech companies source components and assemble products. Despite Trump’s pause on “reciprocal” tariffs that had been set to apply to many US trading partners, tariffs on China will increase to 125% from 104%. And while tariffs pose a direct challenge to tech giants, their economic ripple effects could also have negative implications if consumers and advertisers tighten their purse strings. Analysts had warned that long-term reciprocal tariffs, and the resulting economic uncertainty, could shrink tech earnings by as much as 25%, according to a Sunday report from UBS. That would mark a big shift from the relatively steady profit and share price gains that Big Tech has enjoyed in recent years thanks to AI. On Monday, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Trump’s tariff policy as an “Armageddon” for the tech sector, adding that it “makes the tech investing landscape the most difficult I have seen in 25 years covering tech stocks.” Meta, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and a representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Musk has experienced the most dramatic losses. Despite donating at least $290 million to support Trump’s reelection and his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, the world’s richest man’s net worth has plunged $143 billion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index data from April 8. That’s due largely to the sharp decline in Tesla shares, weighed down by Musk’s controversial work in the government, increasing competition and now, the threat of tariffs. Tesla shares fell 28% and its market capitalization dropped $376.6 billion since the start of this year, as of market close on April 9, having largely erased its post-election gains. Musk has said tariffs could have a “significant” impact on Tesla. While Musk may be in the spotlight due to his proximity to Trump, he’s not the only prominent tech figure to experience recent losses. (The most recent net worth data available on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is from April 8; the scale of their losses may be smaller after the market’s rebound Wednesday.) Meta was one of the first big companies to pledge a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg has met with Trump repeatedly, both before and after he took office, to discuss policy priorities. Zuckerberg also made several Trump-friendly changes to his business, including elevating a prominent Republican to the company’s top policy job, cutting professional fact-checkers and adding Trump ally and UFC boss Dana White to Meta’s board of directors. Zuckerberg’s net worth has fallen by $26.5 billion since the start of 2025. Meta’s share price has declined nearly 2.25% year-to-date, dragging down the company’s valuation by $35.8 billion. Bezos was quick to congratulate Trump on his election win in November, calling it an “extraordinary political comeback,” and Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Bezos was also behind The Washington Post’s controversial decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Bezos’ net worth has declined by $47.2 billion since the start of this year, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s shares are down 13% year-to-date, bringing the company’s total valuation down by $316.8 billion since the start of this year. Google donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and streamed the event live on YouTube. And Pichai joined the parade of CEOs who visited Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the election. But Google’s stock has now fallen 16.2%, and its valuation is down $386.7 billion since the start of this year. Apple’s Cook also personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, Axios reported in January, after meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election to discuss tariffs and European tech regulations. Apple also handed Trump a political win earlier this year when it announced a $500 billion investment in US facilities over the next four years. Although some of those plans were likely in place before Trump took office, the president claimed credit for the move, saying it showed “faith in what we are doing.” But Apple, which produces many of its gadgets in foreign markets such as China, Vietnam and India, is expected to take an especially big hit from Trump’s tariffs. Its stock is down 18.5% from the start of this year, and $684 billion has been shaved off its market value. During Trump’s first term, many big tech companies lobbied for exemptions from Trump’s tariffs. This time, however, the situation is much less certain, a point that analysts at Moody’s Ratings made in a recent research note. “While it is difficult to estimate the effects,” the analysts wrote, “we believe no technology subsector will go unharmed.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

April 09, 2025 18:58 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe. If you invested in AppLovin and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Title: Consumers fearing price hikes from tariffs may be stocking up on pantry staples

Watch CBS News April 9, 2025 / 6:03 PM EDT / CBS News President Trump's reciprocal tariffs are currently on hold, but that's not stopping some consumers from stocking up canned foods and other nonperishables that they think could be affected by tariffs in the future. In the days immediately following Mr. Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2, purchases of goods in shelf-stable categories, including canned and jarred vegetables, instant coffee, ketchup and beer rose from the week earlier, according to data from Consumer Edge, a provider of consumer spending insights. Consumer Edge analyzed physical receipts and other transaction data at a variety of retailers, including big-box stores, warehouse clubs and convenience stores, to track purchases by item type. "We are seeing evidence of consumers picking up more items, potentially ahead of tariffs increasing pricing," Consumer Edge's head of insights, Michael Gunther, told CBS MoneyWatch. "We'll see if that continues." Though Mr. Trump on Wednesday issued a 90-day pause on country-specific reciprocal tariffs, a 125% levy on goods from China, also taking effect on Wednesday remains in place. That could mean more pain for shoppers, as tariffs are basically taxes on foreign goods paid for by businesses who then raise prices on products to make up for the added expense. With that in mind, some consumers appear to be shifting their shopping behavior and entering "stock up" mode, according to Consumer Edge. That means stocking up on goods that they would have otherwise purchased at a later time, in order to avoid potential price hikes. Here's how consumer buying patterns changed on April 3-4, compared with buying patterns on Thursday and Friday, one week earlier: Purchase volume also rose substantially compared with the average of all Thursdays and Fridays in 2025, according to Consumer Edge. The uptick in purchases across categories with relatively long lifespans makes sense, according to Gunther. "They will last for some time in someone's pantry, where it's OK to stock up," he said, noting that most coffee sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries. Additionally, on the Thursday and Friday following Mr. Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, shoppers on average took home more items per trip to major retailers Walmart and Target, Consumer Edge data shows. In the days leading up to April 2, shopping destinations including BJ's, Costco and Amazon, saw increases in transaction sizes, or money spent, additional data from Consumer Edge also shows. The larger basket sizes may reflect "preparation for future price increases," according to Gunther. "We saw an increase in the average ticket size among the big names where you might expect people to be going to stock up," he added. "If something shows up in different ways, it lends more credence to this being something real happening. It's important to see the initial reaction and it certainly seems like consumers are responding." It remains to be seen whether or not the pantry-stocking trend continues, as the threat of country-specific reciprocal levies continues to loom. Currently, in addition to the 125% levy on China, a 10% baseline tariff on all global imports remains in place. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group, estimated in an April 3 analysis that Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, if applied at the rates he originally announced, could cost Americans $3.1 trillion over 10 years, amounting to $2,100 tax increase per household in 2025. Experts, however, caution consumers against resorting to panic-buying or hoarding goods they might not need. Such behavior can put pressure on demand, lead to shortages and stoke inflation, the warn.

Title: Trump’s Economic War Against The Communist Chinese Empire Just Went Nuclear

Time Published: 2025-04-09T21:03:42Z

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Well, isn’t this fun? News that President Trump had decided to pause some of the tariffs that he recently unveiled for 90 days sent stock prices soaring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 2,900 points on Wednesday, and that is very good news. But not that much has actually changed, and the global trade war is still officially on. In fact, President Trump just hiked the tariff rate on Chinese imports to 125 percent… President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was authorizing a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, on which he was raising the levy to 125% in the latest twist of a saga that has roiled financial markets for a week. The universal 10% tariffs remain in place. So let’s summarize what just happened. -The universal baseline 10 percent tariffs are still in effect. -The additional reciprocal tariffs that were recently announced have only been delayed for 3 months to allow for negotiations to take place. -The tariff rate on products that we import from China has now been raised to a whopping 125 percent. -Other previously announced tariffs remain in place. As you can see, the reality of what we are facing hasn’t really changed much at all. But headlines that boldly proclaimed that “the tariffs have been paused” sent stock prices screaming higher. The extraordinary rally that we just witnessed really didn’t make much sense at all, but we’ll take it. These days, any victory that we can get is a reason to celebrate. Of course there shouldn’t have been any confusion about what Trump just announced, because what he posted on his Truth Social account was very clear. I have put the most critical parts of his post in bold so that you won’t be able to miss them… Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Virtually everybody is still being hit with a 10 percent universal tariff. And our economic war with China has just gone nuclear. The reason why Trump raised the tariff rate on Chinese goods to 125 percent is because the Chinese just dramatically hiked the tariff rate on U.S. imports… China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump’s import duties on Chinese good went into effect today at a rate of 104%. In addition to hitting the Chinese with a tariff rate of 125 percent, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is warning that President Trump is also considering removing Chinese companies from our stock exchanges… He also said that all policy options remain open, including the possibility of removing Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. “Everything’s on the table,” before adding that it will be the President Trump who will decide on this matter. Can you imagine what would happen if Trump actually did this and then the Chinese retaliated by doing the same thing to U.S. companies? It would be a bloodbath. Our economy has been so deeply entangled with the Chinese economy for so many years, but now an economic death match between our two nations has begun. If there are products from China that you wish to purchase, I would get them now while you still can. It is being reported that Amazon has already been canceling orders for products that are imported from China… Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. In a few months, there will be shortages of certain products that we have become dependent on China to produce for us. In addition, we are being warned to brace ourselves for “significant price shocks”… Americans will be hit by significant price shocks on a huge array of everyday items under sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump. Clothes, shoes, electronics and cars will be impacted, alongside food, alcohol, and many other essentials. A lot of people are telling me that the short-term pain will be worth it because everything will work out in the end. So let’s see how things play out. President Trump has also announced that new tariffs will be coming on imported pharmaceuticals… US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines. For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. This is going to be interesting. We are very heavily dependent on pharmaceutical production from China. Needless to say, the drug shortages that we have been witnessing in recent years are only going to intensify, and prices are likely to go haywire. Meanwhile, our farmers are going to suffer because the Chinese aren’t going to be buying their output. At this stage, it is being reported that Trump administration officials are considering a new round of bailouts for U.S. farmers… The Trump administration is exploring options to shield American farmers from deepening fallout as its trade conflict with China intensifies, including a possible revival of bailout programs once used during earlier skirmishes with Beijing. According to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, officials are “looking at that again,” referencing a $28 billion aid package deployed during President Trump’s first term through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a government-owned entity designed to support farm incomes and prices. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like,” Rollins told Bloomberg Wednesday at the White House, adding that no final decisions had been made, emphasizing the administration’s hope that aid wouldn’t be necessary. What about the rest of us? Can we get bailouts too? This economic war between the U.S. and China is going to cause pain on both sides of the Pacific. Those that assume that this is going to be a one-sided match simply do not understand how much the Chinese economy has grown in recent years. For example, one Chinese electronics giant is doing things that nobody else in the world is doing… I’d never seen anything like this Huawei campus. Built in just over three years, it consists of 104 individually designed buildings, with manicured lawns, connected by a Disney-like monorail, housing labs for up to 35,000 scientists, engineers and other workers, offering 100 cafes, plus fitness centers and other perks designed to attract the best Chinese and foreign technologists. The Lianqiu Lake R&D campus is basically Huawei’s response to the U.S. attempt to choke it to death beginning in 2019 by restricting the export of U.S. technology, including semiconductors, to Huawei amid national security concerns. The ban inflicted massive losses on Huawei, but with the Chinese government’s help, the company sought to innovate its way around us. As South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper reported last year, it’s been doing just that: “Huawei surprised the world by introducing the ‘Mate 60’ series, a smartphone equipped with advanced semiconductors, last year despite U.S. sanctions.” Huawei followed with the world’s first triple-folding smartphone and unveiled its own mobile operating system, Hongmeng (Harmony), to compete with Apple’s and Google’s. President Trump is going to do his best to crush China, and the Chinese are going to do their best to crush us. My concern is that this economic war could ultimately lead to a shooting war. Our relations with China are going downhill really fast, and the Chinese have been engaged in a “staggering” military buildup… NATO must not be ‘naive’ about China in light of Beijing’s ‘staggering’ expansion of its armed forces, the alliance’s chief has warned. Mark Rutte said the country’s substantial investments in its defence capabilities must act as a wake-up call for Western nations who have not taken the threat seriously so far. For years, I have been warning over and over again that the U.S. and China are headed for an inevitable military showdown. Many criticized me for this for a long time, but now we can literally see how we are going to get there. History is being made right in front of our eyes, and the Chinese are pledging to fight this economic war to the end. But if this economic war ultimately evolves into something else, we will all be wishing that we could turn back the clock.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Index Roars Back After Reprieve on 'Reciprocal' Tariffs

Major U.S. equities indexes surged after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause of "reciprocal" tariffs on imports from U.S. trading partners around the world, less than a day after the levies took effect. After fluctuating in early trading, the S&P 500 screamed higher following the latest shift in trade policy, ending with a daily gain of 9.5%. The Dow advanced 7.9%, while the Nasdaq rocketed 12.2% higher. The technology sector outperformed as stocks that had been clobbered by concerns about the impact of extensive tariffs clawed back some of their recent losses. Shares of microcontroller and analog chipmaker Microchip Technology (MCHP) jumped 27.1%, notching the best daily performance of any S&P 500 stock, while shares of power management semiconductor provider Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) popped 23.4% higher. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares, which have garnered significant attention because of the firm's artificial intelligence (AI) chips, surged 23.8%. The push higher for the stock came in spite of a downgrade to "sector weight" from "overweight" by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, who cited downside risks to gross margins amid increasing price competition with Intel (INTC). Delta Air Lines (DAL) lifted the airline industry by reporting better-than-expected sales and profit results for its fiscal first quarter. Although Delta announced plans to cut back on capacity growth in the second half of the year as it navigates the uncertain economic environment, its shares took off following the strong earnings report, gaining 23.4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, shares of rival carrier United Airlines (UAL) soared 26.1%. Telsa (TSLA) shares gained 22.7% in the wake of the tariff reprieve. In addition, the research firm Benchmark included the electric vehicle maker's stock among its best investment ideas, noting a more attractive valuation following recent price declines, the potential for a recovery in sales driven by a new vehicle launch, and potential catalysts from Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving initiatives. The heaviest loss among S&P 500 constituents was on Dollar General (DG) shares, which slipped 1.9%. The stock managed to buck the downtrend in the broader markets this week as concerns about deteriorating macroeconomic conditions boosted the outlook for cost-conscious consumers seeking bargains at the discount retailer's stores. Dollar General shares also attracted an upgrade earlier this week from analysts at Melius Research, who highlighted the company's relative lack of exposure to tariffs. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), which operates an electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, fell 1.5% after UBS trimmed its price target on the stock. Although analysts lifted their first-quarter earnings estimates to reflect increased credit volume, they anticipate that lower pricing could restrain revenue growth during the period.

Title: Where Will Amazon Stock Be In 5 Years?

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. At its current price, the e-commerce giant is a good growth pick for patient and thick-skinned ... More investors. Blink and you could miss the latest trend in Amazon’s stock price. Under an onslaught of conflicting tariff news, investors are wavering between bear and bull outlooks on the e-commerce giant. It's the worst kind of thrill ride, with real money on the line. Wondering how Amazon will fare in Trump's second term and beyond? Here's a look at the factors affecting AMZN stock's growth outlook over the next five years. Spoiler alert: The U.S. tariff policy is a key theme. Amazon has a diversified business model that includes retail sales, cloud computing, digital advertising and streaming entertainment. Amazon.com is the most visited shopping website in the world, accounting for nearly 13% of desktop visits, according to Statista. Statista also reports that Amazon’s cloud offering, AWS, has a leading 30% market share, ahead of Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud. As well, Amazon Prime Video is atop the U.S. streaming market with a 22% market share, according to Evoca.tv. Amazon stock is up 81% over the past five years, averaging 16.2% annually. Like many tech stocks, the growth trajectory has not been linear. 2022 was a negative year, followed by two growth years in 2023 and 2024. 2025 began strong, but tariff announcements from the U.S. government and the subsequent global economic fallout drove AMZN down about 20% since February 1. Amazon has positive and negative forces in play over the next five years. The company's growing advertising business, e-commerce dominance and AI offerings could drive improved performance. Challenges include the threat of global recession and a looming antitrust lawsuit. Amazon’s advertising business produced $17.3 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, 18% more than the prior year period. The annual run rate has doubled in four years, as sellers invest in sponsoring their products on Amazon's e-commerce platform. The company also launched streaming video ads on Amazon Prime last year. With the addition of streaming ads, Amazon can deliver messaging at multiple points within a customer's decision-making process—from brand awareness ads on Prime to conversion ads on Amazon.com. The company also offers robust data analytics so customers can understand how each channel contributes to overall sales. Other e-commerce sellers cannot meaningfully compete against Amazon’s dominance. The company's global scale, reach and brand recognition will deliver a long-lasting stream of shoppers to Amazon's digital properties. This supports ongoing revenue from retail sales, Prime memberships, product ads and, indirectly, Prime video ads. Amazon's ongoing investment in automation and robotics for faster, cheaper order fulfillment should widen its competitive advantage. AWS has grown recently as business customers move to cloud-based computing, in part to take advantage of generative AI technologies. AWS continues to expand its AI toolset to support that transition. The company has also launched the Trainium2 AI chip, which offers "30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally available today,” according to CEO Andy Jassy’s April 10, 2025 annual shareholder letter. and announced development plans for a supercomputer for AI training and computations. The company's investment in AI development tools and hardware will continue as long as demand remains strong. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings webcast, President and CEO Andrew Jassy described AI as "the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." Threats of global recession and stagflation in the U.S. are weighing heavily on investors since President Trump announced worldwide tariffs on April 2. A wide-scale economic downturn would hurt Amazon across multiple areas of its business. The good news is that Amazon has managed through a global financial crisis before. AMZN stock dipped more than 40% near the end of 2008 but then reversed those losses by mid-2009. Given its size and financial strength, Amazon will survive an economic downturn better than most. Additionally, the 2025 stock price decline has reduced the valuation and risk. There may be more declines ahead, but it helps that some uncertainty is already priced in. In 2023, the FTC under the Biden administration sued Amazon for illegal actions to stifle competition. The trial had been slated to begin in September, but the FTC recently asked a judge for a delay due to resource constraints. Experts disagree on Trump's potential handling of this case. On the one hand, Trump may push the FTC to drop the charges because they were initiated under his predecessor. On the other hand, Trump has not backed down from other antitrust cases against big tech. Amazon retains an average strong buy recommendation from analysts, according to Stockanalysis.com. There are 25 strong buys, 19 buys and one hold. The consensus price target is $260.89, 40% higher than AMZN’s current price. This includes price target reductions initiated since the April 2 tariff announcement by analysts at Mizuho, Bank of America Securities, and JP Morgan. The cuts ranged from 10% to 18%. Investors, too, believe the high U.S. tariffs undermine Amazon's growth outlook. AMZN stock is down about 14% for the year, a decline prompted by Trump's initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China announced in February. After the more extensive April 2 tariff announcement, AMZN's price dipped about 9%. Those losses quickly reversed once Trump paused tariffs for many countries except China on February 9. The bullish scenario for Amazon involves quick stabilization of the global economy. In a normal economic environment, Amazon should be able to grow earnings roughly 20% annually over the next five years. Applying that growth to the company’s current P/E ratio of 34 implies a five-year price target in the high-$400s. That's more than double AMZN's current price. Amazon's current P/E ratio is well below the company's historic average, so this may be a conservative bull view. If the world economy stagnates, the future looks different for Amazon and its shareholders. The 20% annual earnings gains will not materialize, at least until economic conditions stabilize. Worse, investors will be reactive until the crisis ends. Any earnings miss or signs of slowness could prompt selloffs. There will be more volatility in Amazon's stock price than in its business results. Price swings will be the defining trend for the foreseeable future. Amazon’s current price point will prove to be a super buying opportunity—but whether that happens in three, five or 10 years is uncertain. The timeline depends on the economic fallout from Trump's ever-changing tariff policy. Assuming the tariff crisis passes, Amazon’s five-year outlook is strong. The company can deliver double-digit earnings increases annually, thanks to its dominance across e-commerce, cloud computing and streaming entertainment. Investors who can hold on through the volatility could see their AMZN positions double in value, or better. Bottom Line Amazon is a good long-term investment, but economic conditions may delay the rewards beyond five years. At its current price, the e-commerce giant is a good growth pick for patient and thick-skinned investors. If that doesn't describe you, look for more investing ideas in this list of best stocks for 2025. Amazon’s stock price could double or better in five years, assuming a global trade war and related economic fallout doesn't undermine the company's growth prospects. Amazon is a good long-term investment. The company has leading market share in three industries, including cloud computing where AI is driving demand. Global economic uncertainty is Amazon's biggest risk. A downturn that impacts consumer and business spending patterns would limit Amazon's growth prospects across multiple divisions.

Title: Media, Tech Stocks Soar After Trump’s Tariff ‘PAUSE’

WB Discovery’s stock surges 20% after the president’s announcement A number of media and tech stocks suddenly leaped higher on Wednesday afternoon, after President Trump stunned Wall Street by announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that are currently negotiating with the U.S. on new trade deals. Comcast and Netflix enjoyed big jumps on Wednesday, with each company seeing its share price increase more than 7%, while WB Discovery’s stock price surged 20.62% by the time markets closed. Apple, meanwhile, increased 15.33% to about $199 per share — a welcome sight for investors in the world’s most valuable company, after it shed nearly $1 trillion from its market cap over the last four trading days. “I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” the president posted on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The announcement sent the three major indexes soaring higher, with the S&P 500 up 9.52%, the Dow Jones up 7.87%, and the Nasdaq up 12.62% by the time trading ended on Wednesday. It was the largest single-day percentage jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq since 2001 and its second-largest ever, while the S&P 500 had its biggest day since 2008, per CNBC. Other tech and media stocks that are up big include: Fox Corp.: +8.56% News Corp.: +9.22% Roku: +15.90% Amazon: +11.98% Meta: +14.76% Simultaneously, President Trump said he was increasing the tariff against China to 125% — hours after a new 104% tariff against Chinese goods went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The jump for the three major indexes comes after brutal stretch for Wall Street bulls, following the president’s unveiling of his “liberation day” tariff plan last week. Overall, the downturn was the sharpest Wall Street had experienced since COVID-19 rocked the markets in March 2020. Earlier on Wednesday, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had warned a recession was “likely” if the new tariff plan remained in place, echoing the fears many other business bigwigs and Wall Street analysts have shared in the past week. That sentiment appeared to suddenly shift on Wednesday afternoon, with prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman lauding the president on X. “This was brilliantly executed by @RealDonaldTrump,” Ackman posted. “Textbook, Art of the Deal.” President Trump, as markets opened earlier in the day, urged Americans to “BE COOL!” on Truth Social, saying “everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” He then added moments later “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY,” followed by three exclamation points. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said countries were “falling over themselves” to make deals with the U.S. Trump, in his Truth Social post on Wednesday, said more than 75 countries had reached out about making trade deals.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.

The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Trump tariffs are 'an Armageddon scenario' for U.S. tech, analyst says

The sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration — including a 104% duty on Chinese imports — have one analyst calling the move an “Armageddon scenario” for the U.S. technology sector. That’s according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who warned Wednesday that President Donald Trump’s tariffs “will go down as the worst U.S. policy mistake” since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which deepened the Great Depression. Ives said the tariffs will significantly affect the U.S. tech sector because the “hearts and lungs of the supply chain are cemented in Asia.” He wrote, “A U.S. tech company CEO cannot decide last night... ‘Lets call Smith Semi Fab Operations in the Midwest to get those semi chips’... as there is one slight problem... IT DOES NOT EXIST... and would take 4-5 years to build a manufacturing plant... and the labor force does not support this in the U.S.... the IP of the supply chain is cemented in Asia after 30 years of making U.S. tech products... and the products will go up 3x-4x once implemented after years... being paid by the U.S. consumers/companies.” Ives added, “‘Debacle’ is an understatement for this tariff policy.” The “self-inflicted uncertainty” of the tariffs has “turned the global supply chain upside-down, and U.S. consumers are the ones paying,” according to Ives. He doesn’t expect any tech companies to give guidance on first-quarter conference calls, given all the uncertainty. Still, he recommends owning stocks in Apple (AAPL+4.00%) and Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) because “despite this massive, near-term uncertainty, it does not change their installed base, technology leadership, and long-term growth opportunities, especially with Nvidia leading the AI industry.” Apple is down 20% since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on the so-called “Liberation Day” on April 2 and 28% year-to-date. Nvidia is down 10% since the recent tariff announcement and 26% year-to-date. Ives said Wedbush will stay fluid. The firm work under the assumption that the tariffs in their current form will stick around for a few months and will adjust its numbers as the tariffs change or remain. The Wedbush analyst recommends tossing out the next few quarters (June and September) and working with new financial models for 2026 for valuations as the tariff situation gets negotiated. Ives said his firm has a worst-, base-, and bull-case framework that it’s using to screen tech stocks; that’s how Wedbush will “navigate this unprecedented situation” and hold investors’ hands over the coming days and weeks. “Market volatility and nervousness has been one of the highest I have seen in 25 years on this job covering tech stocks on the Street,” Ives said. “Now, the question is what is next and how to navigate this Category 5 storm tariff coming to the U.S economy.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Dow and S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses at midday Wednesday amid heightened volatility after the U.S. imposed wide-ranging tariffs overnight and China responded with higher tariffs on U.S. goods. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose as tech stocks gained. Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares soared, leading gains on the S&P 500 after the carrier's fiscal first-quarter results came in better than analysts expected. Apple (AAPL) shares also rose, helping the iPhone maker reclaim its title as the world's most valuable company by market capitalization from Microsoft (MSFT). Simply Good Foods (SMPL) shares jumped after the snack foods firm’s quarterly results topped estimates and it affirmed its full-year outlook despite tariffs uncertainty. Oil and related energy stocks fell, as crude prices fell to levels last seen in 2021. Shares of energy giants Chevron (CVX) Exxon Mobil (XOM), and BP (BP) all dropped. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and other big banks lost ground as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said a U.S. recession would be a "likely outcome" as the Trump administration’s tariffs rattle markets. Shares of several major pharmaceutical companies slumped as Trump threatened tariffs on the industry. Shares of AstraZeneca (AZN), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), GSK (GSK), and Sanofi (SNY) all declined. Gold futures climbed and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. The U.S. dollar lost ground against the euro and yen but rose against the pound. Prices for major cryptocurrencies were mixed.

Title: 10 Top U.S. Companies To Grow Your Career In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. U.S. professionals are fueled by the desire to progress professionally, especially when it comes to ... More upskilling in tech Remote work is not the only factor in a job that U.S. professionals care about. Even though many would be happy to exchange work benefits like PTO and health insurance for the ability to work remotely, according to FlexJobs, American workers are almost equally fueled by the desire to learn new skills so they can progress in their careers, making this a top priority when seeking new job opportunities. A recent discovery by LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report 2025 noted that learning new skills is high on the agenda for employers who wish to attract and retain top talent, with survey respondents citing this as their number one turnover reduction strategy. Additionally, LinkedIn reported more than a quarter of professionals who are seeking to learn new skills this year and are keen on progressing in their jobs. Consequently, LinkedIn revealed its popular list of the top 50 large workplaces for professional growth and development. The best part about this list is that all employers included in the ranking are currently hiring, with some hiring for hybrid-remote and fully remote roles. So you’ll be sure to find an opportunity that matches your interests. Here are the top 10 employers from LinkedIn’s Top Companies 2025 report: Why did these employers make the cut for this list, you might ask? LinkedIn evaluated these large companies--who each have about 5,000 or more employees to be eligible for inclusion in the list--based on qualities such as enabling their people to stay ahead with AI upskilling and development, and the development of technical skills-building pathways internally. Notably, in a signal move for bank JPMorganChase, about 70% “of roles for experienced hires--or candidates with full-time work experience--do not require a college degree,” LinkedIn noted, which means that the bank is yet another big-name employer to join the ranks of others such as IBM who have taken steps to abolish degree credential requirements from their roles and actively promote skills-based hiring. To get hired by top-tier employers like EY, PwC, or JPMorganChase, you need to be a top-tier candidate. That doesn’t mean you need to have graduated from an Ivy League college, or have a perfect, prestigious resume filled with your accomplishments at Big Four employers. But what this does mean is you’ll need to find ways to creatively differentiate yourself from the rest. Here are some top tips and an action plan to achieve this: These 10 companies are hiring right now, and they’re actively looking for someone like you who is proactive and passionate about continuous growth, aligning with industry shifts and trends, and climbing the next rung of professional development. Employers who prioritize skills-first hiring and internal upskilling will win in the talent ... More competition Despite many of these companies being at the forefront of headline layoffs this year, there are still thousands of positions up for grabs as they move towards a more efficient workforce. Are you ready to join them?

April 09, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Big bank stocks rebounded from earlier declines Wednesday after President Donald Trump said he would pause "reciprocal" import taxes for 90 days. Earlier Wednesday, bank shares had fallen as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy could be headed toward a recession as Trump's tariffs rattled markets. "I think probably it's a likely outcome," Dimon said in a televised appearance on Fox Business' "Mornings with Maria." Just after 1:15 p.m. ET, however, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would pause most tariffs effective immediately, causing stocks to soar. Shares of JPMorgan were up 8% in recent trading, while Bank of America (BAC) stock rose 6%, and Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) shares jumped 7% and 9%, respectively. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) Several major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday, with investors likely to be watching whether worries about tariffs are hampering clients' borrowing appetites and ability to repay loans. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Title: Tech CEOs Bent Over Backwards for Trump and Their "Reward" Has Been Horrible
URL: https://futurism.com/tech-ceos-trump-reward
Time Published: 2025-04-09T13:06:04Z
Full Content:
Tech CEOs spent millions of dollars on donations to president Donald Trump's campaign and inauguration, and by bending the knee after he was elected. But instead of facing a reinvigorated and less regulated tech market in return, they've instead gotten a kick in the teeth. As the New York Times reports, Trump's disastrous tariff war has caused the global stock market to crater, sending economic uncertainty soaring. And the global supply chains that big tech companies have been relying on for decades have been thrown into chaos. Even investment in the hottest thing in tech right now — artificial intelligence — could take a massive hit, as the cost of building out already-expensive data centers is expected to rise dramatically. It's a bizarre situation. Trump himself has appeared keen to keep the AI gravy train going, overseeing the signing of a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal dubbed Stargate. Yet his trade war could make AI companies' commitments difficult to hold up in the longterm as foreign-made chips could soon spike in price. In short, Trump's trade war could lead to a major falling out with big tech. Apple, in particular, has felt the hurt, reportedly flying planes full of iPhones into the US ahead of Trump's latest round of tariffs coming into effect. That's despite Apple CEO Tim Cook cozying up to Trump, donating $1 million to his inauguration and promising to spend half a trillion dollars in the US back in February. But despite paying lip service to the idea of moving manufacturing to the US, Apple hasn't fulfilled that promise for any of its major products. Instead, it tried to lower its reliance on China by moving assembly lines to India and Vietnam instead — countries that have since been hit with 26 and 46 percent tariffs, respectively. Tech CEOs who were hoping to encounter fewer regulatory hurdles with the Trump administration could soon face even more headwinds. The White House has signaled that it's looking to continue Biden-era antitrust cases looking to break up big tech companies, per the NYT. "Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!" Trump wrote in a January post on Truth Social. In short, tech leaders' efforts to get in the president's good graces are far from paying off. Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House to beg him to settle an antitrust lawsuit against the company. Legislators are worried Trump could simply drop the case, an investigation that has been going on for almost six years. Even after prostrating himself to Trump, though, it's easy to imagine that the president will simply allow the case to proceed.

Title: Delta, Walmart, Apple: Stocks to watch today

Time Published: 2025-04-09T12:47:00Z
Full Content:
Investors were digesting the latest volley in the U.S.-China trade fight early Wednesday, with a 104% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and other tech goods taking effect overnight. The renewed trade tension added fresh anxiety to a day already packed with earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL+3.51%) and Constellation Brands (STZ+0.70%), worrying signals from Walmart (WMT+2.42%) and Apple (AAPL+4.00%), and a wave of big-bank results on deck. Premarket moves among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were broadly lower Wednesday, with Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) off 1% and Apple slipping 2% in early trading. Amazon (AMZN+1.90%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%), and Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum. Bond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.” Delta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading. But while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses. Constellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool. Early Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers. Meanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen. Once a national discount heavyweight, Big Lots was delisted from the NYSE late last year and now trades as a penny stock. Its collapse adds to the growing wave of “retail wreckage” — from Red Lobster’s closures to Macy’s and Foot Locker (FL-4.28%), both of which are shuttering hundreds of stores across the country. Together, these developments highlight the pressure facing retailers: rising input costs, unpredictable trade policy, and a consumer base increasingly cautious about spending. The first-quarter results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) and Wells Fargo (WFC-0.63%) land Friday. Analysts will be watching for loan growth, consumer credit quality, and recession contingency plans. With rate cut expectations pushed deeper into the year, margin commentary will be critical. These earnings may also help set the tone for Q2 investor sentiment.

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. US extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X.

Asian stock markets surge after Trump announces 90-day tariff pause for 75 countries, including India, amid rising trade tensions. China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). Instead, GTRI said, India should consider a limited “Zero-to-Zero” tariff deal on 90 per cent of industrial goods, a model already offered by Europe to the U.S. Read more GTRI report warned that a full FTA with the US could turn out to be a costly mistake. While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month. Factory deflation persisted for a 30th month, with the producer-price index recording a faster drop of 2.5% compared to 2.2% in February. The Philippines has reached out to the U.S. Trade Representative to explore potential trade negotiations, with the best outcome being a free-trade agreement, the Economic Affairs minister said on Thursday after Washington said it would pause planned tariffs. “Let’s see what we can negotiate,” Frederick Go told a media briefing. ( Reuters) China lowers yuan midpoint for sixth day to 19-month low against dollar, signaling PBOC's focus on stability amid trade war. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday. ( Reuters) Trump pauses some tariffs, but not on auto imports, drawing criticism from Michigan business and auto groups. Trump's financial advice on social media led to a surge in stocks, raising questions about market manipulation. Understanding financial terms like capitulation, bear market, and dead cat bounce is crucial during economic uncertainty and market fluctuations. US stocks surge after Trump announces temporary tariff pause, easing fears of recession and boosting market confidence. U.S. dollar rebounds against safe-haven currencies after Trump announces tariff pause, escalating trade confrontation with China. Wall Street indexes surge after Trump announces tariff pause, with Dow up 5.76%, S&P 6.46%, Nasdaq 8.04%. President Trump eases tariffs on most nations for 90 days, raises tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day.

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues.

U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X.

Asian stock markets surge after Trump announces 90-day tariff pause for 75 countries, including India, amid rising trade tensions. China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). Instead, GTRI said, India should consider a limited “Zero-to-Zero” tariff deal on 90 per cent of industrial goods, a model already offered by Europe to the U.S. Read more GTRI report warned that a full FTA with the US could turn out to be a costly mistake. While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month. Factory deflation persisted for a 30th month, with the producer-price index recording a faster drop of 2.5% compared to 2.2% in February. The Philippines has reached out to the U.S. Trade Representative to explore potential trade negotiations, with the best outcome being a free-trade agreement, the Economic Affairs minister said on Thursday after Washington said it would pause planned tariffs. “Let’s see what we can negotiate,” Frederick Go told a media briefing. ( Reuters) China lowers yuan midpoint for sixth day to 19-month low against dollar, signaling PBOC's focus on stability amid trade war. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday. ( Reuters) Trump pauses some tariffs, but not on auto imports, drawing criticism from Michigan business and auto groups. Trump's financial advice on social media led to a surge in stocks, raising questions about market manipulation. Understanding financial terms like capitulation, bear market, and dead cat bounce is crucial during economic uncertainty and market fluctuations. US stocks surge after Trump announces temporary tariff pause, easing fears of recession and boosting market confidence. U.S. dollar rebounds against safe-haven currencies after Trump announces tariff pause, escalating trade confrontation with China. Wall Street indexes surge after Trump announces tariff pause, with Dow up 5.76%, S&P 6.46%, Nasdaq 8.04%. President Trump eases tariffs on most nations for 90 days, raises tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day.

During its Google Cloud Next 25 event Wednesday, the search giant unveiled the latest version of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the custom chip built to run artificial intelligence -- with a twist. Also: Why Google Code Assist may finally be the programming power tool you need For the first time, Google is positioning the chip for inference, the making of predictions for live requests from millions or even billions of users, as opposed to training, the development of neural networks carried out by teams of AI specialists and data scientists. The Ironwood TPU, as the new chip is called, arrives at an economic inflection point in AI. The industry clearly expects AI moving forward to be less about science projects and more about the actual use of AI models by companies. And the rise of DeepSeek AI has focused Wall Street more than ever on the enormous cost of building AI for Google and its competitors. The rise of "reasoning" AI models, such as Google's Gemini, which dramatically increases the number of statements generated by a large language model, creates a sudden surge in the total computing needed to make predictions. As Google put it in describing Ironwood, "reasoning and multi-step inference is shifting the incremental demand for compute -- and therefore cost -- from training to inference time (test-time scaling)." Also: Think DeepSeek has cut AI spending? Think again Thus, Ironwood is a statement by Google that its focus on performance and efficiency is shifting to reflect the rising cost of inference versus the research domain of training. Google has been developing its TPU family of chips for over a decade through six prior generations. However, training chips are generally considered a much lower-volume chip market than inference. That is because training demands rise only as each new, gigantic GenAI research project is inaugurated, which is generally once a year or so. In contrast, inference is expected to meet the needs of thousands or millions of customers who want day-to-day predictions from the trained neural network. Inference is considered a high-volume market in the chip world. Google had previously made the case that the sixth-generation Trillium TPU, introduced last year, which became generally available in December, could serve as both a training and an inference chip in one part, emphasizing its ability to speed up the serving of predictions. In fact, as far back as the TPU version two, in 2017, Google had talked of a combined ability for training and inference. Also: Google reveals new Kubernetes and GKE enhancements for AI innovation The positioning of Ironwood as mainly an inference chip, first and foremost, is a departure. It's a shift that may also mark a change in Google's willingness to rely on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia as the workhorse of its AI computing fleet. In the past, Google had described the TPU as a necessary investment to achieve cutting-edge research results but not an alternative to its vendors. In Google's cloud computing operations, based on the number of "instances" run by customers, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia chips make up a combined 99% of processors used, versus less than a percent for the TPU, according to research by KeyBanc Capital Markets. That reliance on three dominant vendors has economic implications for Google and the other giants, Microsoft and Amazon. Also: 10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next Wall Street stock analysts, who compile measures of Google's individual lines of business, have, from time to time, calculated the economic value of the TPU. For example, in January, stock analyst Gil Luria of the boutique research firm DA Davidson wrote that "Google would have generated as much as $24 billion of revenue last year if it was selling TPUs as hardware to NVDA [Nvidia] customers," meaning in competition with Nvidia. Conversely, at a time when the cost of AI escalates into multi-hundred-billion-dollar projects such as Stargate, Wall Street analysts believe that Google's TPU could offer the company a way to save money on the cost of AI infrastructure. Also: DeepSeek's new open-source AI model can outperform o1 for a fraction of the cost Although Google has paid chip-maker Broadcom to help it take each new TPU into commercial production, Google might still save money using more TPUs versus the price it has to pay to Intel, AMD, and Nvidia to consume ever-larger fleets of chips for inference. To make the case for Ironwood, Google on Wednesday emphasized the technical advances of Ironwood versus Trillium. Google said Ironwood gets twice the "performance per watt" of Trillium, as measured by 29.3 trillion floating-point math operations per second. The Ironwood part has 192GB of DRAM memory, dubbed HBM, or high-bandwidth memory, six times as much as Trillium. The memory bandwidth transmitted is 4.5 times as much, 7.2 terabits per second. Also: Nvidia dominates in gen AI benchmarks, clobbering 2 rival AI chips Google said those enhancements are supposed to support much greater movement of data in and out of the chip and between systems. "Ironwood is designed to minimize data movement and latency on chip while carrying out massive tensor manipulations," said Google. The memory and bandwidth advances are all part of Google's emphasis on "scaling" its AI infrastructure. The meaning of scaling is to be able to fully use each chip when grouping together hundreds or thousands of chips to work on a problem in parallel. More chips dedicated to the same problem should lead to a concomitant speed-up in performance. Again, scaling has an economic component. By effectively grouping chips, the TPUs can achieve greater "utilization," the amount of a given resource that is actually used versus the amount being left idle. Successful scaling means higher utilization of chips, which is good because it means less waste of an expensive resource. Also: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles That's why, in the past, Google has emphasized Trillium's ability to "scale to hundreds of thousands of chips" in a collection of machines. While Google didn't give explicit details on Ironwood's scaling performance on inference tasks, it once again emphasized on Wednesday the ability of "hundreds of thousands of Ironwood chips to be composed together to rapidly advance the frontiers of GenAI computation." Also: Intel's new CEO vows to run chipmaker 'as a startup, on day one' Google's announcement came with a significant software announcement as well, Pathways on Cloud. The Pathways software is code that distributes parts of the AI computing work to different computers. It had been used internally by Google and is now being made available to the public.

Title: When you can expect price hikes — and how severe they may be
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/when-expect-prices-rise-hike-iphone-tariffs-stockpile-consumer-apple-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-09T11:29:44Z
Full Content:
Good morning. If you should ever meet Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, never compare him to Elon Musk. Huang's biographer learned this the hard way. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump's tariffs have gone into effect — we're looking at when you can expect prices to rise, and how severe they may be. What's on deck Markets: Why "The Big Short" investor Steve Eisman thinks the US would prevail in a global trade war. Tech: How grassroots rage at Elon Musk snowballed into global protests. Business: Zillow might not be the place to look for your dream home anymore, thanks to new rules. But first, time for an upgrade? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. $1,549 for an iPhone. After Trump's latest round of tariffs — which went into effect today — UBS's chief investment officer said the Mainland China-assembled iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256 GB would likely see a price hike of $350. The White House's total tariff rate for China now stands at 104%. BI spoke to seven analysts about rising consumer prices and found they expect costs to go up roughly 30% to 50%. It's not just Apple, either. A slew of companies have talked about raising prices due to Trump's tariffs, including Walmart and Target — BI has a running list of them here. Prices on everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to larger purchases like cars and appliances are expected to rise. A Yale economist estimated that the cost to the average household could be about $3,800 this year. "Shark Tank" investor Mark Cuban has suggested Americans begin stockpiling goods before prices go up: "From toothpaste to soap, anything you can find storage space for, buy before they have to replenish inventory," Cuban wrote. So, should you take Cuban's advice and stockpile essentials? Some Americans are. BI spoke with people who say they're buying makeup, skincare goods, pet food, spices, meat … the list goes on. Prices might not rise immediately. Companies may think twice before passing on the cost to consumers. Take Apple: Increasing prices could give competitors like Samsung — who are less affected by tariffs — a competitive edge, analyst Thomas Monteiro said. That said, if you know you'll need a new iPhone soon, it's not a bad idea to act now, BI's Ana Altchek writes. 1. "The Big Short" investor is bullish on Trump and the trade war. Steve Eisman thinks the US would win if tariff escalation develops into a full-on trade war. He's also confident President Trump could get everything he wants from negotiations "if reasonable heads prevail." 2. To buy — or not buy — the dip. There might be a glimmer of hope for the investors suffering through the brutal market sell-off. History suggests stocks could very well shake off these losses, and Truist's chief market strategist agrees: "This is not the time to be selling into panic." 3. History lessons about a looming bear market. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday amid a three-day skid triggered by Trump's tariffs. Goldman Sachs strategists argue the market is now flirting with an event-driven bear market. Here's what to expect if the stock market decisively enters one. 1. Rage against the (Elon Musk) machine. Tesla Takedown protests began sprouting up in February and by the end of March, they had reached more than 250 cities and 13 countries. Here's how anti-Tesla momentum evolved. 2. The angel investors shaking up Silicon Valley. There's a strong correlation between the rising number of women in angel investor markets and more female entrepreneurs receiving angel investing capital. It might be the best way for them to take on tech's billionaire boys club. 3. Microsoft middle managers, beware. The tech giant is considering another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, BI exclusively reports. This time, it's not just shedding low performers. Leaders on some teams are discussing ousting middle managers, people familiar with the matter told BI. 1. The golden age of Zillow is coming to an end.

Consumers won’t be buying as many gadgets during the potential downturn that’s slamming tech stocks, forecasts Daniel Newman of the Futurum Group. But the tariff-fueled disruption could widen giant companies’ advantage over the rest. After President Donald Trump's launched his “Liberation Day” tariff agenda, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index suffered its biggest plunge since March 2020. The so-called Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla — lost a combined $1.8 trillion of market value in two days. The tariff-induced downturn in business conditions is likely to be temporary, according to Daniel Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group, a tech research and advisory firm. Newman told Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino that tech consumers might feel more of the pain, but not much can stop corporate AI adoption and the data center buildout. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Daniel Newman: The consumer part of technology, I think, is really at risk with things like PCs and smartphones. We're saying, hey, we're going to build and screw in our iPhones here. Are we ready for $5,000 iPhones? So if I'm on the consumer side and I'm investing in a company like Apple, I'm really nervous right now, and I think this selling pressure on Apple, which has historically been a flight-to-safety name, is evident that people just don't know. They're not confident. And despite its half-trillion-dollar commitments to do more in the U.S. and even its comments about doing more in India, nobody seems to feel comfortable that the consumer demand will be there because that's also tied to things like recession. So that means a lot of things that smaller companies, individuals, buy become more at risk. Now, on the other side of this, I actually have spent time with a number of CEOs in the Big Tech and megacap companies, and both my perspective and theirs is that things like enterprise [artificial intelligence] and the buildout of the AI superhighway of the future, these big data centers — almost tariff-proof. And there's a couple reasons that it is. One is the large companies will double down on R&D and investment during down cycles. This will give them a meaningful advantage, knowing that at some point, no matter where we land with these tariffs, markets will normalize. People will adjust to it, and the markets will start to grow again. This will not be permanent downside. I do not believe it will be permanent downside, but the uncertainty, as long as it lasts, will come with a lot of either up-and-down whipsaw, like I said, or continued consternation, because the CEOs I talked to are also in a somewhat difficult position to make decisions. But the AI data center build, if I'm looking at companies like Nvidia, if I'm looking at companies like Microsoft that have relatively low consumer exposure, I'm feeling more optimistic. Meghan McCarty Carino: What exactly makes the data center business kind of tariff-proof? I think about kind of physical infrastructure building, we've heard a lot about how the housing market and, you know, building residential could become a lot more expensive. Data centers are also made of stuff that could be tariffed. Newman: Yeah, obviously there's a lot of kind of speculation, some of the continuation of USMCA and the no-tariffs-on-semiconductors [policy] right now is enabling a lot of at least fundamental belief before 232 is fully unpacked, and a longer-term semiconductor decision is being made that you could basically ship chips into the U.S. or Mexico, have these things assembled and avoid tariffs. Now, again, that's just the racks. That doesn't count all the other things that go into a data center. Steel, of course, you know, you've got major workforce issues. You know, we've got, obviously, the two sides of the immigration debate. We know what we're trying to accomplish with safety and security of our borders. But also we know that a large part of workforce that do things like build homes and buildings, maybe we have less access to that type of workforce, bringing input costs up. Of course, all the other things that go into these buildouts and facilities, energy, all things that are going to be up for debate in terms. But realistically, it's about the fact that companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, they have massive operating leverage, and so during this sort of market recession or downturn, they will separate themselves from startups that may have trouble raising meaningful capital, from midsize and growing competitors in the middle of the market that won't be able to invest as heavily. They can build out their data centers faster. They can have the capacity in place. And knowing that this tech is deflationary, I think that's kind of it. There's a tariff element to it, and then there's a fact that companies can actually be more profitable by implementing tech. We saw this in 2022 in the downturn when [quantitative tightening] started, software investment in many companies went up. They invested heavily in platforms that were either automation platforms, analytics platforms that could allow them to more efficiently make decisions while keeping head counts in place. And we actually saw from 2022 to 2024, Big Tech didn't really raise head counts, even though earnings grew considerably. McCarty Carino: When it comes to share prices, I think a lot of people are sort of like playing a tiny violin for these companies with the biggest market caps in the world. The market caps are slightly smaller than they were, but still absolutely enormous. But, I mean, at a kind of basic level, why are capital markets important to any company, but especially to tech companies? Newman: Well, I mean, there's a few different reasons capital markets are important. Of course, there's the literal ability to continually raise needed capital to run the business. These large companies don't have as much of that type of need. They're also a litmus test for how the market perceives a certain company or a certain category. And of course, it's also part of, at least as I see it, American exceptionalism, that the U.S. companies are seen as the world's most valuable companies. [The capital markets are] also full of sort of abnormal actions over short periods of time. But over long periods of time, the market does tend to be a very strong indicator for these companies and for the health of an economy and the health of businesses. McCarty Carino: And for that reason, U.S. capital markets, and especially tech stocks, have been a good place to put money for investors all over the world. That is good for our companies that they attract investment. So what does it mean for tech companies for markets to potentially be in bear territory? Newman: Well, for the tech companies, I think most of these, especially these Mag 7 and large tech companies, I think it really just means battening down the hatches, staying really focused, investing in the right [research and development], not overleveraging and continuing to serve the customers and deliver the innovation and solutions that has gotten them to where they're going. These large companies have incredible operating leverage. And you look at some of them, like Nvidia is supposed to create $100 billion in cash in the next year. Their share price dropping and their market cap going from $3.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion doesn't change their ability to function and operate. And I think these companies have strong [barriers to competition], they have strong customer bases, they have strong margins, and even in periods of recessions, they're generally growing their earnings. Now the expectation for earnings growth sometimes slows, but these companies have strong businesses that continue to grow. They continue to create cash flow. And I think over time, if you can handle the kind of the uncertainty and buy when things seem most uncomfortable, there's endless history and proof points that people that bought during these times do a lot better than those that sort of chase these names into bull markets. McCarty Carino: We've been talking about Big Tech, but what are the kind of ripple effects for little tech, for startups in this kind of an environment? Newman: There's a lot more risk for smaller companies and small tech. You got to watch for a signal. You know, we work with 600 of the world's largest tech companies. The signal that we look for as a smaller company working with many of the larger ones is, when does their spending slow down? Meaning, do you start to see meaningful behavior changes coming from your larger clients? Are they actually slowing their spending down? That signal is often one that smaller tech companies need to look at. You need to be on top of how technology can help. You need to be very focused on delivering great value to your existing customers and just listen to your large customers, because they will tell you. The large customers tend to know when they need to slow spending and when they start slowing spending, you need to slow spending for sure. McCarty Carino: This isn't the first shock that the tech sector has weathered. In fact, the tech sector seems to have more of them than other industries. How would you sort of put this in perspective of the kind of history of ups and downs in the tech industry and what we can kind of learn from those? Newman: We're going to go through cycles every handful of years. And actually, with the diffusion of innovation speeding up, and the diffusion of information speeding up, I actually think cycles happen at more rapid pace. But the one thing I think we all tend to underestimate is sort of the perseverance. You know, the human condition is we come back from adversity and we come back stronger. The tariffs obviously impact technology, but we will accelerate, and we will continue to innovate, and it will be technology that will get us out of these most difficult situations. It's proven time and time again. So owning the names in tech, it's very hard to bet against over the long term.

Activate your online access Trump’s tariff war is chaotic, but there is no way out of neoliberal globalization without some form of protectionism. A shipping container is moved at the Port Jersey Container Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 8, 2025. United Auto Workers (UAW) president Shawn Fain has many liberals scratching their heads. The longtime critic of Donald Trump who wore a “TRUMP IS A SCAB” T-shirt at the Democratic National Convention last year has come out in support of the president’s favorite economic policy: tariffs. Despite the fact that other leading progressives have expressed extreme alarm at Trump’s plans, Fain has insisted that tariffs are “a tool in the toolbox…to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers.” He’s right, and he’s not alone in thinking this. A group of self-proclaimed “economic patriots” on the left are making a similar case in Congress. Representative Chris Deluzio, a Democrat from Western Pennsylvania who won election in the state’s most competitive district, recently took to The New York Times to plead with his party not to embrace “anti-tariff absolutism” as a response to Trump’s policies. And Representative Jared Golden, a Democrat from a rural Trump-leaning district in Maine, recently made a similar case, arguing, “Tariffs are a first step in rewriting a rigged trade system.” Tariffs are part of any sound trade policy. The way they work is simple: By raising the prices of foreign goods, you make domestic goods more attractive to domestic consumers, thus increasing demand and expanding homegrown production. Of course, Trump’s tariffs are erratic, and their intended purpose is unclear. They will likely do more harm than good. But that doesn’t mean protectionism is inherently a bad idea. In fact, if the left cannot offer a compelling exit from neoliberal globalization, it will be unable to effectively combat the GOP’s national populism with a social populism of its own. Rethinking trade must be a central part of a pro-worker agenda. For many union members, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) marks the beginning of US decline. The agreement made it so that money, goods, and labor could flow more freely across the continent. Since it was enthusiastically signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993, manufacturing jobs have drained out of the United States to lower-wage corners of the globe. And NAFTA wasn’t even the worst of it; a succession of trade deals followed, including the admission of China into the World Trade Organization. This led to a collapse of manufacturing jobs in the United States. In the 30 years since, around 90,000 US manufacturing plants have been shuttered. The impact on the labor movement has been disastrous. In 1990, around 20 percent of workers in the US belonged to a union; by 2024 that rate had plummeted to around 9 percent, a record low. The decline of manufacturing and union density combined with looser border restrictions that invited hyper-exploited foreign-born workers into the United States have crushed wages, which have been stagnant for non-college-educated workers. By swapping high-wage often union jobs in manufacturing, for low-wage nonunion jobs in services, free trade has effectively robbed the working class of its social, political, and economic power. Few industrial unions have been as affected as the UAW. Since the 1990s, the autoworkers have witnessed over 60 major plant closures among the Big Three automakers. Membership in the union peaked at around 1.5 million in 1979. Today, the UAW has around 390,000 members—a 74 percent decrease. Worse, even when the union manages to make inroads in new plants, companies always have an exit option. They can pack up and relocate to places where labor is cheaper. What’s more, layoffs and plant closures have had a devastating effect on the towns and cities that depended on industrial wages and investments. While some economists insist that job losses in manufacturing have been offset by the arrival of cheap goods from China (and ever-rising stock prices), they discount the devastating social, psychological, and political effects of plant closures. The mounting “deaths of despair” and rise of opioid addiction, concentrated in working-class former industrial cities and towns, indicate a social rot that began with the country’s embrace of free trade. Politically, despite Bill Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s confidence that a super-charged global “knowledge economy” would generate broad-based prosperity that would reward progressives, the results have not been good for Democrats. In fact, as wages stagnated, working-class voters have drifted away from the party. No Democratic candidate for president has ever matched Bill Clinton’s level of support with these voters. Lyndon Johnson feared that he lost the South for a generation by passing civil rights laws, but liberals seem unaware that by signing NAFTA, Democrats did the same for blue-collar workers. Obama even tried to deepen the disaster with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was never ratified. By 2016, the populist backlash had arrived. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders slammed the establishment for disastrous trade deals. And both won a larger share of working-class voters than their establishment counterparts. And the United States wasn’t alone. A recent meta-analysis by political scientists, led by Gábor Scheiring at Georgetown University, found that the surge in populism all over the world is driven by a reaction against the insecurity induced by globalization. While debate remains over whether workers were driven away from the left because of economic issues or cultural ones, with globalization the two phenomena are linked—the same market forces that drove manufacturing to extinction also helped to drive the increasing pace of cultural churn. Of course, globalization didn’t only generate losers. Skilled professionals have done well under free trade. Those with advanced degrees plugged into the knowledge-city hubs that dot the globe have seen salary increases over the last 30 years, and they’ve reaped significant consumer rewards as well, from the arrival of cheaper foreign goods to the arrival of cheaper foreign labor, like nannies and maids. One consequence of their relative economic success, however, is that the educated middle classes have pulled away from the working class socially, politically, and culturally. Ironically, as the white-collar class became more liberal, they became less aware of the economic interests or aspirations of their blue-collar counterparts—which explains their constant exasperation that someone of modest means might vote for Trump. Not only this, but because of the nature of their work, professionals maintain effective control of the means of cultural production, and they’ve, perhaps unwittingly, imposed their own aesthetic and cosmopolitan tastes on the broader public. One way to think of the culture wars is as a process of elite cultural reeducation. The academy, the media, and the sprawling nonprofit industrial complex has, since the 1990s, insisted upon new ways of speaking, writing, and thinking that quickly become litmus tests for whether one is considered moral by the liberal literati. This process has only exacerbated working-class resentment: Not only has globalization not worked out for the working class economically, but culturally they’re now expected to ape the values of their social betters. But none have benefited as much as Wall Street, the über-rich, and the multinational mega-corporations. The wealthy reap rewards on both sides of the globalization gambit. They rake in record profits off cheap labor in foreign countries where unions and workplace rights are weak or nonexistent. And they benefit from the privileged position the new global order affords them. The freedom to invest and divest in whatever country they choose gives the rich immense power over the world’s poor, whose governments clamor to attract new investment by depressing wages and promising investors freedom from taxes and regulation. The result is that the rich have grown much richer. In 1990, CEOs made roughly 76 times what their typical employee made, by 2023 that number grew to 290 times. Over the same period, the number of billionaires in the United States has grown by more than 1,000 percent. Since 2024 their wealth, through the magic of finance, has grown by $3.9 trillion. These numbers are mind-boggling, but as Labor Institute director Les Leopold usefully put it: “If you earned $1,000 per hour, it would take you 68.5 years to reach $1 billion.” Put another way, you don’t earn a billion dollars. You steal it. What’s been the upshot for the economy overall? Nothing great. As the population of billionaires ballooned, the high growth rates promised by free-trade enthusiasts never arrived. Larry Summers, once an economic adviser to the hyper-globalizing Clinton administration, has recently expressed doubt in the possibility for renewed global growth. Superrich people, it seems, are far more likely to save their money than plow it into engines of economic dynamism. Meanwhile, the rest of us don’t have adequate wages to spend. The suppression of mass demand means that, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, “The U.S. Economy Depends More Than Ever on Rich People.” And all because neoliberal globalization broke the back of labor all over the world. As the German political economist Wolfgang Streeck said, “Without trade unions, no mass purchasing power; without mass purchasing power, no investment.” And what about Mexico? Some of globalization’s dead-enders insist that without free trade, workers in countries like Mexico would be a lot poorer. But even this seems dubious. For years the unwritten accord with Mexican auto workers was that, while they would have lower wages than their American counterparts, their plants would employ a lot more labor. Wages would be spread around. Yet today high-tech automation imported from all over the globe is employed to displace Mexican workers—a phenomenon known as “premature deindustrialization.” Mexican workers have suffered hyper-exploitation at the hands of foreign multinational corporations for decades, and now those same corporations are laying off the cheap labor they relied on to lay off American workers. It’s clear, after 30 years, this system isn’t working for the working class. This brings us back to Shawn Fain. Fain knows that Trump’s tariffs are dangerous. He knows that chaos creates economic risks. He knows that Trump’s anti-labor record is not going to benefit US or foreign workers. But he also knows that there is a big division in the political and business class right now, and he’s keen to exploit it. Wall Street hates the tariffs; the political establishment hates the tariffs; even Elon Musk seems to hate the tariffs. Trump’s signature economic policy has the potential to crack up his coalition. It’s in moments like these that a new common sense can form. In some ways the post-globalized order is already here. Global trade has stagnated since the 2008 crisis, and the public has no appetite for another NAFTA-type free-trade agreement. Yet what comes next is uncertain. Right now, in the debate over trade there seem to be only two voices: Wall Street or Trump. Fain offers a better vision than both. Dave Zirin Jeet Heer Elie Mystal Steve Brodner Fain is right when he argues that auto manufacturers can afford to eat the tariffs without passing on price hikes. Consider that, despite labor-saving automation, manufacturers were charging record prices for a new car before tariffs—in some cases 10 points above the general inflation rate. Where is that money going? Into auto-industry profits that have grown over 50 percent since 2019—despite depressed sales. Fain is right that the industry has “excess capacity” and that tariffs “could bring work back in very short order” by reopening recently closed or underutilized plants. And he’s right that tariffs, combined with an effective industrial policy, could boost workers’ wages, not just in the auto industry but across the board. But more than all of this, Fain is right that we need to restore democratic sovereignty over our economy. The kind of protectionism he envisions has been a “tool in the toolbox” throughout the history of the labor movement. In some ways it’s the foundational idea of progressive economics. Alexander Hamilton, who was so recently the subject of much liberal admiration, was a huge fan of tariffs. So was the most important progressive economist of all time, John Maynard Keynes. And as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik argues, the major “trilemma” of the free-trade regime is precisely that we cannot maintain “hyperglobalization, democracy, and national sovereignty all at once; we can have at most, two out of three.” Too many liberals are now rejoicing at Wall Street’s rejection of the tariffs as if “the markets” are a substitute for democratic input. But plunging stocks only prove what we already knew: that high finance is loath to get off the free-trade gravy train. The turmoil itself demonstrates how hard it is to implement any kind of economic control over the financial paymasters, and it will surely signal to many of Trump’s supporters that he is taking on the elite. It’s right to be clear-eyed about Trump’s recklessness; indeed, Keynes warned that a move away from globalism “should not be a matter of tearing up roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction.” Trump has no patience for that, but the left can’t fall into the trap of letting Wall Street set the terms of the debate. To match Trump’s national populism, we need a social populism of our own. We should not retreat to advocating for free trade as a response to stock market panic but advance to a conversation about industrial planning. We need a program that seeks to repatriate American finance, claw back the trillions in taxes lost to offshore banking, and reinvest in US jobs. The tariff is one of the tools we need to rebuild the economy in favor of the working class. Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the Director of Operations for Teamsters Local 623. A president who bullies Congress kowtows to the bond market. Jeet Heer I don’t know exactly what went down in the hours before Trump publicly announced a “pause” on tariffs, but it merits investigation. Sasha Abramsky The fallout from Trump’s tariff plans has pitted the Republican financial elite against MAGA culture warriors in a way that threatens to split the coalition. Chris Lehmann The president’s tariff war is also a constitutional crisis. Jeet Heer The economy took an immediate hit after the president’s “Liberation Day ”announcement. Chris Lehmann New trade barriers are going to reduce demand for US exports while increasing the cost of living domestically. This will only worsen conditions in the manufacturing sector.

Title: On the Opaque Origins and Tumultuous Ancient History of Homer’s Odyssey

Full Content:
In some ways, the Odyssey needs no introduction: it is everywhere around us. Over the nearly thirty centuries since Homer’s thrilling epic about the hero Odysseus’s homecoming from the Trojan War began to circulate, its story, characters, and themes have become so tightly woven into the fabric of our literature and art, music and drama, that they seem to us inevitable, natural. It’s with a start that we recall that someone had to invent them. Whether you’re reading Virgil’s Aeneid or watching The Wizard of Oz or Finding Nemo, you are enjoying a story that borrows the Odyssey’s plot: a hero, separated from home and loved ones, must wander among strange peoples and fantastical places during a difficult and often dangerous journey before arriving at last to reclaim both family and homeland. As you make your way through Dante’s Inferno, J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, or Stephen King’s Stand by Me, you are following a metaphorical arc first traced by Homer: the journey through space and time as a symbol for intellectual growth and discovery, for a deepening appreciation of the relationship of the self to the world, for the trajectory, finally, that we all follow from birth to death. The most suspenseful and exciting of the Odyssey’s plot twists—when the hero finally returns, he is in disguise and can thus secretly test the loyalty of those he left behind—has been endlessly recycled, from authors such as Alexandre Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo) to filmmakers such as Ridley Scott (Gladiator). And the climactic testing of the Odyssey’s hero, who must prove both his identity and his worthiness to assume his destined role by meeting a series of challenges both physical and mental, has resurfaced in modern epics like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The Odyssey bequeathed to the West entire genres. The poem’s fascination with the alien creatures and unfamiliar cultures that its wandering hero confronts was the seed from which both fantasy literature and science fiction would eventually blossom; Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Star Trek share strands of an Odyssean DNA. The Odyssey also established the blueprint for the picaresque novel, whose rollicking narratives about sly characters barely scraping their way through a series of hair-raising escapades, from Don Quixote to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, echo Odysseus’s progress from Troy (where the ingenious ruse he dreamed up, the Trojan Horse, won the war) through encounters with monsters, seductresses, and ghosts, to Ithaka, the home he strives so hard to reach. The marital drama of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope—a couple agonizingly separated, the man and woman each facing different kinds of peril, eventually reunited only after a tense test of wits proves to each that the other is an ideal mate—contains the germ of all romantic comedy. The pleasure readers experience when Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy finally come together at the end of Pride and Prejudice is a direct descendant of an emotion experienced by Homer’s audience thirty centuries ago as they listened to a bard sing of the reunion of Ithaka’s royal couple, fully revealed to each other at last after a separation of twenty years. The Odyssey has provided inspiration for a number of important modernist and contemporary authors. James Joyce’s 1922 classic Ulysses (the title uses the Roman name for Homer’s wandering hero) is composed of sections that are both named for and modeled on episodes of Homer’s epic: “Circe,” “Proteus,” “Lotos-Eaters,” and so forth. Motifs and characters from both the Iliad and the Odyssey resurface in Omeros, a 1990 epic poem on themes of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade by the St. Lucian writer Derek Walcott, winner of the Nobel Prize, while the American poet Louise Glück, also a Nobel laureate, examined a collapsing marriage through a retelling of the Odyssey in her 1996 collection Meadowlands. More recently, numerous women writers have taken the epic’s female characters and reimagined the events of Homer’s story from their points of view. In books such as Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad and Madeline Miller’s Circe, the reorientation of narrative perspective reminds us that the ancient works, originally composed by men for primarily male audiences, are nonetheless rich in complex female characters whose literary potential is still being tapped. The large themes of Homer’s epic have proved to be enduring ones. The poem’s presentation of Odysseus as someone whose desperation to return home is tempered by an endless curiosity about the strange places through which he wanders provokes questions about how we navigate between the allure of adventure and the satisfactions of home. The depiction of the poem’s protagonist as a gritty survivor who—in stark contrast to the haughty warriors of the Iliad, for whom dying young in battle is a fair price to pay for everlasting glory—will stoop to virtually anything in order to stay alive demands that we reevaluate what we mean by the word “hero.” Odysseus’s fraught interactions with immortals such as the nymph Kalypso, whose offer of eternal life and youth he rejects in favor of returning to his aging wife, force us, like the hero, to grapple with the meaning of mortality and the value of human love, even as his relationships with his wife, his bedmates, his son, and his father offer insights into the relations between men and women, parents and children. And the epic’s complex portrayal of its morally ambivalent main character—a man whose impressive intellectual gifts, technological expertise, and “godlike” cunning nonetheless very often leave destruction and sorrow in their wake—often reads like a dark parable about Western civilization itself. The Odyssey further displays a marked interest in a subject that some readers are more likely to associate with the work of twentieth-century modernist writers: the workings of language and rhetoric, the nature of poetry and literature. Odysseus’s expertise as a talented raconteur (and, when the occasion demands, an expert liar), along with the epic’s many scenes of him and other characters telling, exchanging, and enjoying a tale whose point is clearly self-serving, raises tricky questions about the uses of narrative and its relationship to truth. Meanwhile, the Odyssey’s frequent references to and depictions of poets, singers, and bards, along with repeated episodes in which professional bards—like Homer himself—give performances on whose formal qualities and emotional power other characters comment, can lend the proceedings a startlingly “meta,” even postmodern feel. Strikingly modern, too, is the Odyssey’s sophisticated inquiry into the nature of identity. The vehicle for that investigation is the poem’s constantly shifting presentation of its chameleon-like hero, whose adeptness at both falsifying his appearance and fictionalizing his life story makes it almost impossible to trust what we think we know about him—and, hence, impossible to know who he is. The issue is slyly raised already in the Odyssey’s opening line, which avoids naming its protagonist, referring to him instead simply as “a man.” Not very helpfully, that same first line allots this nameless man precisely one adjective—polytropos, literally “having many twists and turns”—which, at once vague and yet suggestive of endless possibilities, seems intended simultaneously to illuminate and to confound our understanding of just who this man might be. Over the twelve thousand one hundred nine lines that follow that opening, we see so many “turns” or facets of this character that it sometimes feels as if he is becoming more, rather than less, difficult to grasp as his story proceeds. * And so we can read the Odyssey today with a bracing sense of déjà vu: we feel we know these narratives, we have met these characters, we recognize these themes. Yet the epic of Odysseus’s return is, in many ways, as unfathomably strange to us as the one-eyed giant Cyclops was to its hero. Its origins, even after centuries of scholarly investigations, are opaque, its poetic conventions sometimes off puttingly foreign, certain of its values passé when not outright repugnant. Small wonder. The Odyssey is the product of the civilization of Archaic Greece—that is, Greece before the classical era, before the “golden age” of Pericles, Greek tragedy, Athenian democracy, the Parthenon. That civilization flourished between around 750 BCE, when the Iliad and the Odyssey likely began circulating, and around 500 BCE—the moment when the Athenian democracy was established. But the civilization described in the Odyssey had flourished another half millennium earlier, in the final stage of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600—1150 BCE). This was the civilization of Greek kingdoms such as Mycenae, Argos, Tiryns, and Pylos, of the luxurious and sophisticated cities of Knossos on Crete and of Troy in Asia Minor. These states, known as “palace-cultures,” were organized around a royal palace, or megaron, as the center of social, political, and economic activity, and each palace was presided over by its warrior-king. The principal characters in both the Iliad and Odyssey are such kings: Odysseus of Ithaka, Achilles of Phthía, Nestor of Pylos, Menelaos of Sparta, Agamemnon of Mycenae. Between 1200 and 1150 BCE, nearly all these cities were destroyed, probably as the result of both natural disasters (drought, earthquakes, fires) and of economic and political upheavals. During the centuries after the fall of the Bronze Age palace-cultures—a period of such greatly reduced literacy and such minimal large-scale building and craft production that it was long referred to as Greece’s “Dark Ages”—the tales Homer would later tell about the Trojan War began circulating, aglow with idealized reminiscences of the civilization that had so suddenly vanished. These tales eventually coalesced into a grand sequence of epic verse narratives known as the Epic Cycle. Composed by various poets and together comprising many tens of thousands of lines and at least seventy-seven “books”—that is, papyrus scrolls—this cycle traced the arc of the war from its distant prehistory (the wedding of the parents of Achilles, the Greeks’ greatest warrior) through its proximate cause (the Trojan prince Paris’s seduction of Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaos), to the events of the Trojan War itself, culminating in the Sack of Troy; and thereafter the adventures of a number of the Greek warriors as they returned home (related in an epic known as the Nostoi, or “Returns”). The final bizarre ramification of the cycle’s most attenuated plotline was the slaying of Odysseus, in his old age, by his son Telégonos, his child by the witch Circe, related in a work called the Telegony, at the conclusion of which Telégonos marries Penelope and Telémakhos marries Circe(!). Of this cycle, only fragments and summaries survive. The only two complete epics about the Trojan War that have come down to us are the Iliad, about events that took place during the final year of the war, and the Odyssey, about the nostos, or “return,” of one particular hero. Scholars continue to debate the relationship between those two epics and the Epic Cycle: which came first, and which inspired the other. As distant as they were from each other, both the civilization that the Odyssey commemorates and the civilization that produced the epic shared a number of features that are profoundly alien to modern sensibilities. For one thing, both were deeply patriarchal cultures. Although they played key roles in religion and cults, women had no political rights or status, could not own property, and were themselves often little more than chattel, objects of exchange whose chief role was to produce children and perform homely domestic tasks. (Even the queens in the Homeric epics, from Helen of Troy to Penelope, are often depicted engaged in spinning and weaving; so, too, the goddesses Kalypso and Circe.) The economies of these cultures, moreover, were based largely on the labor of enslaved people—prisoners taken in war, victims of forced abductions—who, like many of the slaves depicted in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, spent their lives performing work both domestic and agricultural for masters who expected their loyalty as a matter of course. Hence, like other great works of literature from remote eras and different cultures, the Homeric epics present us with a classic conundrum: How can a work that seems to speak with such truth about so much that matters to us have been produced by a culture with certain institutions and values so alien to us? Only an attentive reading of the poem can begin to forge an answer to that question. As to the poem’s formal conventions, they are likely to strike modern readers as equally inscrutable. You don’t have to progress very far into the text before you notice a number of peculiarities unlike anything familiar from other literary encounters. Of these, the high degree of repetition is likely to be the most striking. Not only do most characters have descriptive epithets that are repeated nearly every time their names appear—“Athena of the bright owl-eyes,” “Telémakhos, sensible lad,” “Penelope, clear-thinking woman”—but entire lines and even whole passages are repeated, verbatim, throughout the poem. Scenes of feasting, for instance, nearly always include the line “Then they stretched out their hands toward the food that was spread before them,” while the end of the meal is just as regularly signaled by the phrase “But once they had put away their craving for drink and for food…” Between those two moments, Homer often repeats the following five-line passage, describing the dinner preparations and service: A maidservant brought in water, pouring it out from a ewer— Exquisite, wrought in gold—into a basin of silver, For the guest to wash his hands. Then she placed a table nearby. The housekeeper, worthy woman, brought the meal and served it, Glad to have so many dishes to set out from her storerooms inside. (1.136–40) Such devices were, in fact, almost certainly the products of the distinctive manner in which the epics were composed and transmitted—which is to say, not in writing but orally. The texts of both epics were long thought to have been the work of a single genius named Homer, who wrote his poems. Scholars began to reconsider the origins of the poems, however, in the late eighteenth century, when a manuscript of the Iliad containing not only the text of the epic but transcriptions of the “scholia”—the marginal notes by various ancient commentators that had accreted over the centuries—was discovered in Venice. These precious annotations were of enormous value in their own right, since relatively little has survived of the vast body of ancient scholarship and commentary on Homer, which was often impressively erudite. (The Roman geographer Strabo, a contemporary of the emperor Augustus, makes reference to a thirty-volume work by someone called Demetrius of Skepsis that treated just sixty-two lines of the second book of the Iliad.) But what was so exciting about the marginalia in the Venetian manuscript was that many of the notes, which referred to a number of ancient editions of the poems, concerned questions that the ancient commentators had about the authenticity of certain lines and passages. If the epics had been penned by a single author, scholars wondered, why were there so many variants already in ancient times? Could the authentic text by Homer be recovered by judiciously sifting through the variant versions? By the early nineteenth century, the Venetian manuscript and the writings of those who had studied it were roiling the intellectual and literary worlds by raising a different set of questions. What if there were no authentic Homeric versions of the poems—what if, indeed, there had been no Homer in the first place? As the century progressed, more and more classicists were persuaded that the epics must originally have been composed by illiterate oral poets in an era before the Greeks adopted an alphabet and writing became widespread; the Iliad and Odyssey, they argued, could not have been the work of a single bard but instead represented an accumulation of smaller, self-contained poems (or “lays”) composed by different poets of different eras. Adherents of one school of thought, known as “Analysts”—from the Greek word analyô, “to break [something] down into its component parts”—claimed to be able to distinguish among the various strata of composition in each of the epics; some insisted that they could make out “original” versions of the poems lurking beneath the layers. The Analysts were opposed by so-called “Unitarians,” who continued to insist that the poems, whatever flaws in consistency and irregularities in style and coherence they might occasionally display, were the product of a single genius. The debate about the authorship and transmission of the epics, known as the “Homeric Question,” raged on into the twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, a classicist named Milman Parry proposed a theory, based on an insight he had into Homer’s verbatim repetitions, that transformed the way we understand how the epics were composed. Parry suggested that those repeated lines, passages, and epithets—the latter almost always occurring in the same position within a line of verse—must have functioned as prefabricated placeholders for oral poets who composed their works in performance. The rigidly formulaic nature of the repetitions, he argued, were traces of a poetic process that combined memorization of traditional elements with improvisation: if the bard knew in advance how a line was going to end—“Zeus, who marshals the clouds,” say—or could count on being able to insert a formulaic passage of several lines, he could devote his energies to what we might think of as the “creative” parts. (It is worth noting, however, that within an oral tradition, a poet’s canny manipulation of traditional formulas and scenes could itself be considered creative.) Parry bolstered his hypothesis by drawing parallels between Homer’s epics and the epic verse of contemporary Yugoslav bards whom he had studied, who adapted and improvised on traditional material in the way he believed the Homeric performers may well have done. Most contemporary classicists, it seems safe to say, accept Parry’s core theory about the oral tradition in which the Homeric epics evolved. The poems likely began as relatively short compositions by preliterate bards who drew on traditional material—legends about the Trojan War, folklore about stock figures (wily tricksters, man-eating ogres, sage old kings), myths about the various gods—to fashion their songs. With each performance, they might elaborate on earlier compositions, refining and adding, even as they continued to rely on and employ traditional diction, epithets, and stock phrases and scenes. (Passages in the poem where a given epithet fits the meter but doesn’t fit the occasion were, according to Parry, traces of the poems’ origins as oral performances) As successive generations of poet-performers kept adding new material to their own and their peers’ works, individual lays—Achilles’ quarrel with Agamemnon over the enslaved captive Briseis, say, or Odysseus’s encounter with the Cyclops—presumably began to coalesce into larger works with grander arcs and themes: the climactic struggles of the Trojan War and what they tell us about the nature of human striving and mortality, Odysseus’s return from the war after twenty years and what it tells us about time and identity, family and home. Eventually, these increasingly vast works were committed to writing, possibly by a gifted poet-editor who collated the various versions known to him and assembled them into something like their present form. Just when this happened is, typically, up for debate. One theory that was long prevalent—based, in part, on comments by ancient authors such as Cicero—was that the first definitive written texts of the epics were compiled in the late 500s BCE on the orders of the Athenian ruler Peisístratos, who was keen to institute a recitation of the epics as part of a grand civic festival known as the Panathenaia. (For some scholars, this explains why a minor character in the Odyssey is called Peisístratos: an ingratiating nod to the event’s sponsor.) Such festivals, along with religious occasions, funeral games, and Panhellenic gatherings such as the quadrennial athletic games, were important venues for public recitations of the epics as well as other works. These performances, quite different from the intimate recitals in the courts of kings and nobles that are depicted in the epics themselves, were a vital part of Greek cultural life from the Archaic period on. The men who performed the recitations were known as rhapsodes, a term likely derived from the Greek verb “to stitch together,” presumably because they would piece together the mythic and folkloric material they inherited, the lays and various episodes, the traditional lines and formulas, into their compositions. Ancient texts refer to a law enacted by a son of Peisístratos requiring that the epics be performed in their entirety at the Panathenaia, each work being divided into parts that were assigned to the rhapsodes by lot, with successive rhapsodes reciting the different sections in order. For this to happen, of course, there needed to be a fixed text. And yet, it is clear that numerous versions and variants continued to circulate and the poems continued to evolve. Starting in the early 200s BCE, the plethora of such variants in the collections of the Library of Alexandria convinced the scholars who worked there that it was imperative to create a definitive critical edition of the poems. The version they and their successors produced eventually became the basis of a standard edition, widely circulated throughout the classical world and eventually copied and recopied by hand over the next millennium and a half, until the invention of the printing press. The first printed edition of the Odyssey was published in 1488, in Florence. All this helps to explain why the existence of “Homer”—the blind bard who, people thought for centuries, single-handedly composed both the Iliad and the Odyssey—is now questioned. Today, the name has become a convenient way of referring to all the obscure processes by means of which a loose collection of legends about the Trojan War and its aftermath were transformed, over time, into the two great epics we have today: masterpieces of astonishing structural complexity and coherence, great dramatic power, and profound insight into the human condition. (I will use “Homer” in this way.) Indeed, whatever the controversies about the identity of the epics’ poet (or poets), whatever the debates about the date and manner of their composition, there has never been disagreement, either ancient or modern, about the importance of the two Homeric epics. Through two millennia of Greek civilization, they remained the twin foundations of Hellenic culture, from the Archaic Era through the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, twenty centuries later: an essential part of education, the inspiration or models for much if not most subsequent literary and dramatic works, revered as sources of insight into subjects from ethics to medical treatments, and enjoying the supreme status and exerting the pervasive influence on Western culture that we associate with the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, which the Homeric poems eventually joined as the foundations of European civilization. __________________________________ Reprinted with permission from The Odyssey by Homer and translated, with an Introduction and Notes by Daniel Mendelsohn, published by the University of Chicago Press.

Title: GSMA: 2025 set to be year of satellite commercialisation
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366622198/GSMA-2025-set-to-be-year-of-satellite-commercialisation
Time Published: 2025-04-09T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
Ubotica After partnerships in the sector expanded rapidly over the course of the past 12 months, the next year will be pivotal for commercialisation in the telco-satellite arena, with direct to cell (D2C) communication the main focus due to its monetisation potential from extended coverage – but the business landscape now hinges on whether telcos charge for them, according to research from GSMA Intelligence. The report from the business intelligence arm of the global mobile suppliers’ association – Satellite and NTN tracker, Q1 2025 – looks at the current competitive landscape in the space communication arena, including the existing and new commercialisations pathway and key partnerships. It highlighted three takeaways: that 2025 is ground zero for commercialisation; whether operators will or won’t charge for services; and how surging business at AST SpaceMobile is changing the business landscape. Primarily, the report notes that 2024 was a set-up year characterised by a widening of telco-satellite partnerships that at the end of February 2025 stood at 99, with 21 live by this time. This led to a total mobile connection footprint of 5.98 billion, and 68% of the total connections base was covered by satellites and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). D2C continues to be the main attraction for operators due to the monetisation opportunities from an extended coverage footprint. In addition, the report notes that the internet of things (IoT) is of great interest given that the latest standards (Release 19) in the sector incorporate new functionality for NTN services geared at IoT applications such as sensors, telematics and energy monitoring. Release 19 also adds new functionality such as RedCap into NTNs for IoT. There is already a competitive segment that focuses mostly on IoT (such as Skylo and Orbcomm), with the new standards also attracting Iridium and other legacy satellite providers. Starlink is regarded as an “X factor”, with the potential to put downward pricing pressure across the board, although it would have to tolerate a low-margin business to do this. Recognising that it’s very early days for the industry, the study reports a mixed approach regarding the question of whether telcos will charge for satellite services. It notes that T-Mobile US is running a hybrid model in which high-value customers will have satellite SMS services included for free, while other customers will have the option of a $15/month bolt-on, or $20 for customers of AT&T and Verizon via a roaming agreement. Startone and H3G in Hong Kong are charging, but at a low rate. By contrast, Verizon (SMS by Skylo) and One New Zealand (Starlink) include satellite at no cost. Based on published tariffs, GSMA Intelligence said the implied satellite-associated uplift for an average contract customer sits at 10–30%. It added that the impact on overall revenues is not yet known as services are largely pre-commercial, but that this would be a crucial metric to track over the course of 2025. After a buoyant 2024, the report observed that AST SpaceMobile’s momentum has continued into the first part of 2025, including a key partnership with Vodafone to cover its pan-European footprint (implying an addressable base of some 70 million people excluding Turkey) and a video call demonstration with Verizon. It also bolstered its spectrum position through a lease agreement with Ligado. GSMA Intelligence believes that, theoretically, AST should be well behind Starlink given that it only has five satellites in orbit, a minute fraction of the 6,500 Starlink has. However, the report also emphasises that the higher capacity available with AST’s larger satellites means it does not require as many in orbit to provide a comparable level of service. The report says AST estimates that 45–60 satellites are needed to provide full coverage over North America and Europe, with recent fundings giving a secure basis for subsequent launches in 2025 and 2026. Starlink, its main competitor, continues to roll out new telco partners for its own D2C service, although it’s suffered government customer losses in recent months. Competitors on the mobile satellite service side, such as Viasat and Intelsat, are regarded as having the advantage of secure spectrum, but GSMA Intelligence notes that their D2C services will only work on handsets manufactured in the past four years, making their addressable market smaller.

Title: ‘No wonder why your mortgage isn’t paid.’ – Costco Customer Shows How Their Steaks Are Kind Of A Rip Off

by Michael Levanduski Costco is a great company that offers some amazing deals if you shop smart. This TikToker, however, claims that some of their products are actually a rip off so you have to be careful. The video is him showing a four-pack of really nice-looking steaks with the caption, “Not everything is a good deal here. $69.41” It is crazy that four steaks, even strip lone steaks, cost that much nowadays. He starts talking and says, “$69 for four of these. No wonder why your mortgage isn’t paid.” He is right about that being expensive, but at least they will be delicious. He goes on to say, “I bought the same thing yesterday at Metro for $26.” Wow, I don’t have a Metro around me, but that sounds like a pretty insane deal. I’m wondering how Metro could sell them for such a low price. Maybe they aren’t the same cut or something. If they really are that much cheaper, I might have to start shopping around. Check out the full video and see what you think. You can see the video here: COSTCO OVERPRICED. #overpricedmeat ♬ original sound – P. The commenters are pretty skeptical. This commenter says that they don’t have good quality meat at Metro. Again, someone pointing out the quality difference. Apparently he posted a video of what he bought, and it was low-quality cuts. Some things are too good to be true. Now that you’ve read that story, check out this one about a delivery driver who took a $400 grocery order back because she wasn’t given a tip.

Tata Steel Nederland announces major transformation programme to enhance competitiveness for a sustainable future Stock fell over 2%. Infosys announced it is extending its strategic collaboration with AIB, a financial services group operating predominantly in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. Stock ends nearly 2% lower RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. Responding to the rate cut by 25 bps by RBI, Mr Shailesh Chandra, President, SIAM and Managing Director of Tata Passenger Vehicles Ltd & Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said, “Reduction in rates at this time, would have a positive impact on the Auto Sector, as it will increase accessibility by reducing the financing costs, thereby creating a positive sentiment across the market Sanjay Agarwal, Founder, MD & CEO of AU Small Finance Bank “RBI’s announcement of a 25-bps rate cut in the repo rate along with a change in monetary policy stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ is a welcome step. Heightened geoeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty triggered by the recent tariff announcements is bound to have some adverse spillover impact on growth, even though India would remain relatively insulated vis-à-vis some of the other countries. The display of sensitivity and alertness to these seismic global shifts by the RBI is comforting. Going forward, a benign inflation outlook for FY26 on the back of a normal monsoon and soft commodity prices enhances the scope for incremental policy easing. For banks, the visibility of rate cuts along with the recent improvement in liquidity and Assurance by RBI to provide adequate liquidity for growth abodes well. This should help in lowering the overall interest rates in the economy, improve the credit-deposit balance and aid the overall growth impulse. To summarise amidst the global turmoil, we welcome the policy focus on long-term macro stability.” Harsh Dugar, Executive Director, Federal Bank “The policy recognises the macroeconomic risks and the likely impact of trade wars, has clearly shown the intent to support growth(although the estimate has been revised downward) given the contained benign inflation environment. The reduction in the repo rate will lower borrowing costs, stimulate investment, and ultimately contribute to sustained economic growth. We expect the RBI to remain supportive on liquidity to support transmission in interest rates and support credit growth .”. Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Forvis Mazars in India “The RBI’s rate cut is a timely step to keep the economy on track as global uncertainties rise. Banks are well-placed to lend more actively, and with inflation expected to ease further, consumers could feel more confident about big-ticket purchases. Many sectors are going to benefit from the rate cut. With borrowing costs now slightly lower, homebuyers and developers could find more breathing room, giving a welcome push to the real estate sector. On the rural side, strong farm activity is likely to boost income levels, which may support spending in smaller towns and help keep consumption steady. RBI’s stance has shifted from neutral to accommodative now, which means RBI may go for another 25-bps cut in the second half of 2025, especially as the focus gradually shifts toward reviving demand and encouraging investment in a slowing global environment. Overall, the policy balances caution with action, aiming to protect growth without losing sight of inflation risks.” Piyush Baranwal, Sr. Fund Manager, WhiteOak Capital AMC on RBI MPC announcement*. “MPC today delivered a second rate cut in successive meeting while also finally changing the policy stance from neutral to accommodative, thus giving further clarity on the trajectory of rates going ahead. Continued tariff wars could diminish growth globally, India included. This may depress prices of goods impacted by tariff walls as well as prices of various commodities, causing India’s inflation to remain under check. Together, these open up room for further rate cuts from RBI to the tune of 50 bps in the coming months, though the same can change quickly on either side given the elevated uncertainty. Pertinent to note here that current lower spreads for Indian G-Secs vs. the US treasury when compared to the past may not necessarily be an impediment in these spreads narrowing further. This is on account of the unique issues plaguing the US bonds such as elevated fiscal deficit, compounded by potentially diminished inclination of global central banks and other investors in buying US treasuries unlike in the past. This is due to the seemingly erratic behavior from the US government, which has upended the globally established norms of trade and investments for both friends and foes alike, causing anxiety in the minds of the global community. Given the indications of continued policy easing and comfortable liquidity from RBI, we believe longer duration bonds as well as spread assets should likely outperform going forward.“ Divam Sharma, smallcase Manager, CEO & Co-Founder at Green Portfolio “The softening of crude oil prices and the US dollar has certainly helped the broader fight against inflation. This trend has further strengthened the case for the RBI to consider rate cuts and shift focus toward supporting growth. Now, looking at the global picture—China is likely to face increasing challenges in exporting to the US. However, it will continue to manufacture at scale. As a result, the surplus goods not going to the US will be redirected to large consumer markets like India. India, in turn, is gradually opening up to Chinese imports, which could lead to cheaper goods flowing into the country. This increase in supply and competition can further help in keeping inflation in check. Additionally, the fall in crude oil and other commodity prices, especially in a low-growth global environment, adds another positive layer to the inflation outlook. That said, there is a flip side- domestic industries that are either trying to restrict imports, substitute them, or rely heavily on exports may feel some pressure. Their margins could be dented in the short term. However, a reduction in interest rates would provide a strong push for domestic businesses. It would lower borrowing costs and incentivize investment, which is crucial for sustaining growth momentum. All in all, this is a welcome move. While the short term may remain volatile, the long-term prospects look promising. With falling interest rates, opportunities to replicate China’s manufacturing model, cheaper imports, and potential for new bilateral trade agreements, the outlook for India over the next six months and beyond is quite encouraging. The move was largely on expected lines, with the RBI maintaining a wait-and-watch stance. We anticipate inflation to remain subdued, creating room for further rate cuts—potentially one or two more over the course of this year. While the short term may see some volatility, as the RBI has also acknowledged, the medium to long-term growth outlook remains strong. This is supported by robust domestic consumption and emerging export opportunities, driven by improving trade relations with many of the world’s major consumer markets.” Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital on RBI MPC announcement “The challenging global economic situation resulting from Trump Tariffs is likely to result in global economic slowdown. While India’s economy is insulated to a large extent from global economy, it is bound to be impacted by the global slowdown, albeit to a lesser extent, compared to other more export-oriented economies. Under these circumstances RBI’s rate cut is supportive of domestic growth and is welcome. Since the global challenges could last for several quarters to years, continued growth-supportive policy stance is expected in the near future from RBI. Reduced domestic interest rates put pressure on the INR towards depreciation. However, given that the crude oil prices are also crashing on the back of expected global slowdown, a depreciating INR would not be that much of a concern from oil imports point of view, but would actually be helpful in exports given the increased competitiveness required due to the tariffs.” Suresh Darak, Founder, Bondbazaar* Global volatility & huge uncertainty, due to unilateral final imposition of trade tariffs by the US, has led to wild movements on rates globally. For instance the US 10 yr Treasury yield has gone up by ~25bps overnight. Tariffs, if continued for long, should be inflationary on the immediate basis while it’d slow demand in the medium term. RBI seems to be trying to move past the tariff noise and addressing the demand slowdown concern with the repo rate cut of 25bps and change of stance to accommodative. Interesting times are up ahead over the next 1-2 months, and the US govt. actions will significantly impact rates globally including in India. “Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has delivered a 25 bp rate cut changing the stance to accommodative from neutral with a greater confidence of convergence and a durable alignment of headline inflation with a target of 4% over a year horizon going forward. With the comfort of more predictable inflation trajectory aligned to the target range; the need to support both consumption and investment led growth has taken a centre stage and the subsequent MPC decisions will be growth centric in the near term. An accommodative stance entails easy monetary policy that is geared towards stimulating the economy through softer interest rates. While the governor, in his statement, has stated that stance directly provides the policy rate guidance, without any direct guidance on liquidity management; he has also mentioned that liquidity management serves as an important operating tool with the RBI for various purposes including monetary policy transmission. Taking clues from this, we expect the regulator to provide sufficient durable liquidity as we move ahead in FY26 for an effective and efficient transmission of the rate cuts to wider sections of Economy. 10-year government bond yield is expected to hover in the range of 6.35% - 6.50% during the rest of Q1 FY 26. The CD curve, which is used as a base curve for pricing bulk deposits, has significantly come off; further the asset curve is likely to get softened primarily driven by sections of loans linked to external benchmarks.” -- Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder, Dezerv. “In today’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25-basis-point reduction in the repo rate—from 6.25% to 6.00%. Additionally, the MPC changed its stance from neutral to accommodative, clearly signalling support for growth through potential future rate cuts. This move is in line with our market expectations. It’s important to note that this stance change does not directly imply increased liquidity; however, RBI has confirmed it will continue to manage liquidity as needed. Key takeaways: ● Policy outlook: In the coming months, provided there are no significant economic shocks, we anticipate the MPC will either maintain current rates or implement additional rate cuts. We expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, depending on global factors and tariff developments. ● Growth forecast: GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downwards to 6.5% from 6.7%, reflecting cautious investment and spending due to ongoing uncertainty. However, urban consumption shows signs of gradual improvement. ● Inflation outlook: CPI inflation for FY26 is now projected at 4.00%, slightly down from the previous forecast of 4.20%. Lower crude oil prices have positively contributed to this improved inflation outlook. Additionally, the RBI announced several non-monetary measures aimed at strengthening the financing ecosystem—these include enabling securitisation of stressed assets, extending co-lending guidelines to all regulated entities, and issuing fresh regulations on gold loans and partial credit enhancement. With falling interest rates, bond prices are likely to rise, benefiting short to medium-term bonds. We anticipate further rate reductions in upcoming MPC meetings, and fixed-income investors should lock in currently elevated yields through medium-term bonds. Investing now enables you to secure these higher returns before they potentially decrease further.” Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors “(RBI) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced a 25 bps reduction in the repo rate, bringing it to 6%. It also changed its policy stance from “neutral” to “accommodative.” The inflation outlook has improved decisively. As projected, there is now greater confidence in the durable alignment of headline inflation with the target of 4% over a 12-month horizon, though the impact of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs continues to loom large.

The revision of stance to accommodation will cushion the secondary impact of tariffs on domestic economy. With inflation under check, growth imperatives will take precedence in FY26. On the regulation side market-based securitization framework for stressed assets, review of policy on gold lending and non-fund-based facility are timely. Widening of co-lending framework gives wider choices to all parties concerned” Shares of Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever, Hero Motocorp, Titan and Tata Consumer Products traded among major gainers, while Wipro, Trent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel depreciated. Top gainers & losers today: Banking stocks fell, including NBFCs Cholamandalam, IIFL Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance as RBI revised repo rate and aims to issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms for gold loans. With inflation forecast for FY26 at 4% the focus of RBI has completely shifted on the GDP growth as numbers got revised downwards to 6.5% from earlier 6.7%. RBI not only reduced interest rates by 25 bps but also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral. Inflation to remain under control as forecast of normal monsoon, record production of wheat and higher production of key pulses will ensure durable softening of food inflation. Also fall in crude oil price will keep inflation under check. If inflation remains under/around 4% for FY26 then the real rate at 200 bps is on the higher side and mostly will be reduced by cutting interest rates further. However RBI would want to keep its arsenal intact if there is any disruption in the world order due to a tariff war. We believe RBI will watchfully go for couple of more cuts in little over as many policy meets. 10 year bond yield may not show immediate correction but this policy has defined the near-term ceiling for it. “The RBI’s policy stance is clearly supportive of the fixed income markets. The continued focus on maintaining liquidity surplus—through both operational tools such as ₹80,000 crore in OMOs—underscores its accommodative approach. The money market rates should come down. While some seasonal tightness in liquidity is expected post-April, we believe the RBI’s proactive management will ensure that the overall environment remains conducive to credit flow and financial stability. There is a risk of tariff war, which we need to watch out. However, since oil prices are down and commodity prices are in control, inflation risk is lower. There could be another 50 basis point rate cut during the rest of the year “The additional 25-basis points rate cut to 6% by the Reserve Bank of India is a significant step in supporting growth and completely in line with the industry’s expectations. As I had mentioned earlier, since nearly 80% of Aadhar Housing Finance’s existing borrowers are on floating rates this reduction will benefit them. At some stage soon this will lead to reduction in Aadhar RPLR thereby reducing EMI burden. The only wait now is for the banks to pass on this benefit to us. Furthermore, many first-time buyers in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) segments will now find it easier to take that crucial step towards home ownership as this move directly translates into lower EMIs and improved affordability. This proactive liquidity support from the central bank clubbed with government initiatives like PMAY 2.0, (SWAMIH) 2.0 fund, income tax exemptions, the introduction of a mortgage guarantee fund will positively accelerate housing demand and aid to government’s vision of housing for all.” The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to shift to an accommodative stance and cut the repo rate by 25 basis points is a welcome move amid global economic uncertainties. This signals the central bank’s proactive approach to support growth and liquidity in the economy, especially in light of potential headwinds such as escalating trade tensions and counter tariffs. The reduction in borrowing costs along with tax cuts announced in budget is expected to boost consumption demand, especially in interest-rate sensitive segments. This can also support discretionary spending, which could aid sectors like auto, consumer durables, and housing. This move can also help India’s relative economic outperformance versus global peers, given the backdrop of a slowing global economy. However, market sentiment was dented by the RBI’s mention of revised gold loan guidelines, which has triggered uncertainty. NBFCs and banks with a strong gold loan portfolio witnessed sharp corrections. The “risk-off” mood among investors, driven by regulatory overhang, contributed to the sell-off. The fact that the guidelines are open for comments and review adds a layer of unpredictability to earnings visibility for these companies. While the policy stance is supportive of growth and liquidity, sector-specific regulatory risks—especially in the gold loan segment—are creating near-term volatility. Investors and stakeholders will be closely watching for clarity on gold loan norms, which could help in reassessing valuations and risk appetite for financials exposed to this segment. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its policy stance to ‘accommodative’ signals a clear intent to support growth amid rising global uncertainties. With inflationary pressures easing—largely due to lower crude and food prices—and downside risks to growth becoming more pronounced post the recent US tariff hikes, this policy move was timely and expected. The change in stance strengthens the case for a continued easing cycle. We expect this to translate into lower borrowing costs, particularly benefiting rate-sensitive sectors such as housing, automobiles, and MSMEs. Real estate, in particular, stands to gain as improved affordability may drive homebuyer sentiment and spur new demand. While the RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5%, external challenges, including trade disruptions and climate-related volatility, may exert further pressure. The outlook for inflation remains manageable at 4%, supported by expectations of a normal monsoon, though risks from extreme weather events must be closely watched. Overall, the policy action reflects a calibrated approach—balancing growth support with macroeconomic stability—and sets the tone for a data-driven, accommodative monetary trajectory in the months ahead.

Jeffrey D. Sachs, renowned economist and Columbia University professor, said, “If we had the Indian Supreme Court, I would not have worried frankly. The Indian Supreme Court is pretty activist — it would strike this down as an enormous presidential overreach. I don’t know about our Supreme Court.” Speaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2025, Sachs sharply criticised the growing concentration of power in the hands of the US President and warned that America is slipping into one-man rule. Referring to former President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers, he said, “The President of the US declared an emergency. Now this is interesting, he claims that he can declare an emergency and then govern without law and just govern with decree.” Sachs added, “Now what he calls an emergency is anything that Donald Trump wants to call an emergency. So he calls our trade deficit an emergency. Well, no, it has been around for 20 some years, it has deep economic causes. It is not something that one person should decide and then override the laws of the land in an emergency decree.” He warned that such actions have left the US “profoundly destabilised”, and questioned whether democratic institutions would respond: “We don’t know whether the courts will be able to enforce a judgment that these actions are illegal, which they plainly are… or whether Congress will wake up and say, hey, we have a rule under Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution, which says very explicitly that the right to levy duties belongs only to the Congress, not to the President.” The professor did not mince words, stating, “We don’t know at this moment if the US is a one-person rule or a democracy with checks and balances. Maybe we will have a coup now, we don’t know. Americans voted for Trump to be ruled as per constitution, not as per decree.”On the foreign policy front, Sachs advised India to remain cautious about its strategic alignment with the US. “American friendships have ended up destroying countries. India should be careful, there is no alliance. India is too big for alliance. Being the most populous country, India needs to take care of its relations,” he said. Sachs alleged that Washington seeks to use India as a counterweight to China: “US wants to use India to beat up China. Don’t play the American game is my advice. US foreign policy is divide and rule for every country in the world. India is too big for the US game. US wants India to bash China, to be part of QUAD.” While we await the revised draft, it is good that the RBI is revisiting the partial credit enhancement guidelines as the segment did not scale up given the restrictions in existing guidelines. Some of the challenges included the capping of the partial credit enhancement only 20% of bond issue though capital requirements were significantly higher in relation to the guarantee provided and limited / back-ended amortization of credit enhancement resulting in guarantee fees outweighing the benefits of cost reduction upon rating enhancement. While we await the details, guidelines to harmonise gold loan practices across lenders augurs well for the segment, given the sharp growth in loan book driven by the gold prices and favourable demand dynamics, as unsecured and personal credit slowed since H2FY2024. With the elevated gold prices at present and the currently favourable risk profiles of the NBFCs in this space, considering the liquid nature of the security, the near-term impact on account of regulatory tightening should be manageable. However, competitive pressures for NBFCs could increase going forward, which remains monitorable. “The RBI has reduced the repo rate by 25 bps and at 6% now indeed delivered on the relief front, and the central bank is ahead of the curve with its policy measures to combat the uncertainties post due to global tariff war. The central bank has provided relief on the rate front for the second consecutive time. The rate cut is complemented well by the change in policy stance from neutral to accommodative. The change in stance indicates the readiness of the central bank to act as per the prevailing situation. Other than the rate cut and policy stance change, the commentary on inflation indicating further softening of inflation due to better crop production and above normal monsoon expectations. The RBI has now cut rates by 50 bps in the current calendar year, a move which is expected to further boost demand for real estate. Lower interest rates are anticipated to propagate better home loan affordability, eventually accelerating housing demand in varied ticket segments. The other measures like RBI allowing securitisation of stressed assets and co-lending between regulated entities and beyond priority sector, along with ample system liquidity will help boost the credit growth in the system. Barring the tariff war, geopolitical tensions, most economic indicators are positive, including inflation, GDP growth and a normal monsoon year.” RBI delivers on expectations: RBI cuts rates, changes stance, and provides comfort on inflation projection. Takeaways: 1. As expected by market participants, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut Repo rate by 25 bps, bringing the Repo rate to 6.00%, Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) at 5.75% and Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) at 6.25%. 2. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also changed its stance to ‘Accommodative’ (from ‘Neutral’). 3. The principal driver for the rate cut and change in stance were RBI’s expectations of a benign inflation trajectory and the need to support moderating economic growth. 4. RBI lowered its Gross Domestic Production (GDP) projection for FY 25-26 to 6.50% (Vs 6.70% earlier). RBI also lowered its FY25-26 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast to 4.00% (Vs its earlier forecast of 4.20%) 5. RBI expressed its view of a moderating growth and softening of inflation of the coming months, which bodes well for bond markets. However, it also reiterated the need for vigilance at this juncture, given the risks posed by the rising uncertainties regarding global macro-economic conditions and its potential impact on domestic conditions. 6. As opposed to expectations of some market participants, RBI did not give any express guidance on market liquidity, but noted the present positive systemic liquidity conditions and reiterated its commitment to proactively The Reserve Bank of India announced a 25-basis point rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6% from 6.25% which is in line with market expectations. The policy stance has shifted from &#39;neutral&#39; to &#39;accommodative&#39;, indicating the possibility of further rate hikes. The RBI assured that liquidity will be infused as required, offering comfort to the markets. Forward projections may remain optimistic, with inflation expected to stay around 4% and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth projected at 6.5%. Given the benign inflation outlook, the RBI is likely to focus on growth through monetary stimulus measures. Overall, the policy is viewed as positive for fixed income markets. Equity markets extended their morning losses in mid-day trading on Wednesday as investors continued to process the Reserve Bank of India’s anticipated rate cut against the backdrop of escalating global trade tensions. The central bank lowered its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent and shifted its stance from “neutral” to “accommodative,” signalling a growth-focused approach. Equity markets decline as RBI cuts rates, shifts focus to growth amid global trade tensions, impacting IT and consumer goods. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a significant expansion of its co-lending framework, which was previously limited to arrangements between banks and NBFCs for priority sector loans only. The new policy will extend co-lending arrangements to all regulated entities and all loan categories. RBI expands co-lending framework to all regulated entities, aiming to boost credit access and drive inclusive growth.

The RBI’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the repo rate to 6%, is more than just a monetary policy adjustment; it’s a calculated gamble on India’s ability to defy global headwinds through the sheer force of domestic demand. The central bank’s decision to revise FY26 GDP growth projections downward from 6.7% to 6.5% reflects realism, acknowledging that domestic demand alone may not be enough to offset external drags. Yet, with global trade fragmenting, export growth uncertain, and capital flows volatile, the economy has no choice except to double down on its most reliable engine: the Indian consumer. This isn’t just about lowering interest rates; it’s about reorienting the entire financial system to fuel consumption-led growth without leaving households and businesses drowning in debt. Financial institutions must move beyond passive rate transmission and actively shape lending toward high-impact sectors. Affordable housing, rural consumption, and small-business credit aren’t just growth drivers they’re lifelines for broader economic resilience. The focus should be on productive lending that boosts incomes, rather than merely spending. For instance, financing agri-tech startups that raise farm productivity puts more money in rural pockets, which then flows into FMCG, autos, and durables. Similarly, supporting MSMEs in tier-2 and tier-3 cities creates jobs that sustain urban consumption. This isn’t trickle-down economics; it’s a direct pipeline from credit to income to demand. But there’s a catch: inflation and currency risks loom large. A consumption surge that relies on imported goods such as electronics or energy could backfire by widening the trade deficit and pressuring the rupee. The solution lies in targeting credit at sectors that stimulate local production renewable energy, food processing, and manufacturing to keep demand leakage in check. Banks must also avoid the trap of reckless retail lending, where easy EMIs today become NPAs tomorrow. The path forward demands precision. Fiscal policy must complement monetary easing think tax cuts for middle-income earners, better supply chains to curb food inflation, and incentives for domestic manufacturing. If executed right, India’s consumption story won’t just offset global drags; it could redefine emerging-market resilience. But if mishandled, we risk repeating the boom-bust cycles of the past. The RBI has fired the starting gun. Now, lenders and policymakers must run the race with discipline. RBI policy – A rate cut as expected, stance change to “accommodation” – growth support all the way. RBI as expected announced a 25 bp rate cut announcement, the second rate cut after the first one in Feb’25, taking repo to 6%. Alongside the stance change to “Accommodation” from “Neutral”. Furthermore, there was a clear message from the governor that the change in stance signaled ‘status quo’ or ‘rate cut’. In addition, with the message that growth inflation trajectory demands monetary policy to be growth supportive – RBI’s path ahead is likely to followed by rate cuts. While lowering growth estimates by 20 bp for FY26 to 6.5%, and inflation estimates also by 20 bp to 4%, clearly there is more support for growth amidst global uncertainties. While acknowledging that the global outlook is clouded with tariff uncertainties, it appears that RBI is more inclined to support growth. Domestic inflation has downside from crude prices and positive drivers from food inflation. While there is risk from imported inflation from currency, inflation is not as much of a concern as much as growth. Overall, the trajectory, despite being guarded has tilted towards a growth-inflation balance from inflation-growth in the previous regime, with a clear emphasis on supporting growth. While there is unknown from tariffs, another unknown is always the weather. While governor acknowledged that tariff related uncertainties are very high, if India is able to manage with lesser dent on inflation, then we can expect more rate cuts down the line.

This is in line with our view of another 75-100 bps of rate cuts in FY2026E, implying repo rate at 5-5.25% by end-FY2026E. The benign outlook on inflation (favorable monsoon, lower crude oil prices to offset INR depreciation) and downside risks to growth will provide room for this deeper rate cut cycle. The RBI’s focus remains on addressing growth concerns as inflation is expected to remain around the 4% handle. We also expect the RBI to keep liquidity conditions ample to ensure smooth monetary policy transmission.” The shares of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited (GRSE) were trading at ₹1,524.85 down by ₹40.95 or 2.62 per cent on the NSE today at 11.25 am. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. RBI delivered a 25bps rate cut, in line with market expectation. The policy stance has been changed to accommodative. The policy and stance continue to remain Growth supportive, as inflation is expected to remain benign. Both Inflation and GDP growth rates have been revised lower. We expect the monetary policy to support greater transmission to help Economic grow in the current uncertain global environment. We expect market rates to remain well supported with 10-yr continue to trade in 6.40%-6.60% range, with positive bias. Short-term yields upto 1 year are also likely to trade in the current range after a sharp rally of 75-100 bps over the last one month. Beyond domestic monetary policy, markets will take further cues from current Global Tariff Wars and its impact on macro-economic parameters and financial stability. “The RBI’s reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps is in line with market expectations and, coupled with the measures taken by them to infuse more liquidity, should signal good times for MSMEs. With much greater competition and global uncertainties, investment in up-to-date machinery is critical to maintaining our competitive edge. The cost of debt has been high in the past couple of years, and the signal towards a benign rate scenario should encourage MSMEs to plan capital investment.” “The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and adopt an accommodative stance is poised to positively impact the real estate sector. Lower interest rates are expected to enhance home loan affordability, which can significantly boost housing demand, especially in the affordable and mid-income categories. For developers, improved liquidity conditions may ease financing pressures, enabling faster execution and delivery of ongoing projects. The move also bodes well for commercial real estate, as lower borrowing costs could encourage business expansion and increase demand for office and retail spaces. While the GDP outlook has softened, the real estate market stands to benefit from the policy’s clear intent to support growth and investment. Overall, the industry is likely to witness renewed interest and improved sentiment, setting the stage for a more active and stable period ahead.” “A cut in the repo rate can be a strong catalyst for the real estate sector. Lower interest rates translate into more affordable home loans, encouraging first-time buyers and investors alike to explore bigger and premium homes. Mid-range and high-end segments will also benefit as buyers feel more confident making long-term commitments. At the same time, the change in stance to being ‘accommodative,’ supports steady decision-making for both developers and homebuyers, reigniting buyer sentiment and boosting overall housing demand. Additionally, with ongoing economic uncertainties in the US and other global markets, many NRIs are turning their attention to their home land . A repo rate cut is likely to further strengthen this trend, as more NRIs see real estate in India as a stable and attractive investment opportunity. This could lead to a significant uptick in NRI-driven investments across the Indian real estate sector.” RBI MPC: Keeping the guards ready ✓RBI’s unanimous 25bps rate cut and stance change to “accommodative” reflect the uncertain global environment and benign inflation environment; the change in stance provides a directional easing bias going forward. Given global volatility and uncertainty, the MPC chose not to frontload all its actions and thus kept its powder dry for rainier days. The fluid global dynamics will require RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows will likely require higher risk premia from EMs. The RBI may want to keep ammunitions ready, given fluid global markets, apart from conventional easing. Options like (i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, (ii) lower daily CRR maintainance requirement for banks to sub 90%, (ii) sterilised INR management, etc. may be used, if needed. ✓ One does not know the extent to which this global trade war could stretch. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more counter-cyclical than fiscal this year. While June 25bps cut is a given, we no longer rule out another 25-50bp cut from there, which could take the terminal rate to 5.25% in this cycle – of course contingent on the extent of the global slowdown/recession ✓ While the 20bp growth downgrade by the RBI to 6.5% for FY26 reflects the uncertain global environment, we think there would be material downward risk to their growth forecast – to the tune of ~50-70bps. This would emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if these global tariffs are maintained, while domestic private economic agents stay largely absent. ✓We reckon with the RBI that FY26 inflation would have a net disinflationary impulse (CPI revised down 20bps to 4%) which could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. China’s survival response to massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia and use of FX as a policy tool. “MPC has delivered almost everything that was anticipated by the market. A 25 bps rate cut and change of policy stance to accommodative are welcome steps. FY 25 growth and inflation projection have been revised downwards by 20 bps to 6.5% and 4%, respectively. Dissipating food inflation, falling crude and uncertainty related to global growth environment seem to have led to this decision. On liquidity though, there is no fresh announcement but there is an assurance on liquidity provision as and when required.” The outcome of the RBI meeting was largely in line with expectations, with a unanimous decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6%. In a notable move, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also shifted its stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, signaling the possibility of further rate cuts in the coming months. Forecast revisions further reinforced this shift in priorities. GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downward from 6.7% to 6.5%, while inflation expectations have been eased from 4.2% to 4%. This suggests that the RBI is placing greater emphasis on supporting growth, particularly in the face of rising external risks such as global trade tensions, while remaining confident that inflation will stay within manageable levels. Overall, the message is clear: the RBI is now more focused on its growth mandate. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, we expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, contingent on how the global trade situation evolves. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday it would issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms and conduct related aspects for gold loans, sending gold loan company stocks sharply lower. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. The RBI’s 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 6% is a timely intervention. Change in stance to accommodative is sentimentally positive, allowing room for better liquidity and growth. Together, they will support both MSME and retail demand. The MSME sector which contributes nearly 30% to India’s GDP and accounts for over 40% of exports, will benefit from this move as it will ease credit costs and improve cash flows, which are critical for recovery and growth in the evolving market dynamics. We foresee improved credit appetite at Indian Bank as MSMEs form a vital part of our lending portfolio. Increasing scope of colending will further strengthen lending to these sectors. This cut is likely to spur demand for home, auto, and personal loans, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 markets, where interest sensitivity is higher. Retail loans grew over 18% YoY as per recent trends and a lower rate environment could further accelerate consumption and support economic momentum. Indian Bank is fully geared to pass on the benefits swiftly and responsibly to our customers, ensuring inclusive credit growth.

A total of 145 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 174 in the lower circuit. RBI’s 25 bps rate cut to 6% and shift to an accommodative stance signals a growth-focused policy. I view this as positive for liquidity and demand recovery. Rate-sensitive sectors like banks, NBFCs, real estate, and autos stand to gain. While banks may see some NIMs compression (Fitch estimates ~10 bps in FY26), improved credit offtake could balance it. Lower rates should boost home and vehicle loan demand. However, global headwinds, especially rising US tariffs, pose risks to export-driven sectors like IT and pharma. Overall, a supportive step for domestic growth with some caution on external pressures. Total stocks traded were 3,785.

The substantial infusion of liquidity into the banking system ahead of the decision had already signalled the central bank’s full commitment to easing financial conditions. The growth-inflation outlook had also become supportive of a shift to an ‘accommodative’ policy stance at this meeting, as recent inflation prints have surprised to the downside, while growth risks have intensified amid rising economic uncertainty. The implementation of reciprocal tariffs by the US is expected to dampen global growth and weigh heavily on export-oriented sectors. Given this backdrop, we expect the RBI to cut rates by a further 25–50 basis points in the current cycle..” GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals received the CIT-Appeal Order under Section 250 r.w.s 143(3) for Assessment Year 2004-2005, issuing income tax refund of ₹49.54 cr (including interest) on 8th April 2025.

Sandeep Indurkar, CEO of Resilient Payments said, “Resilient Payments will carry its online business under brand name ‘BharatPe X’. This sets the stage for us to accelerate our plans to build a scalable, merchant-first payments platform. We’re looking to broaden our footprint across high-potential markets, enhance our product suite, and bring more innovation to how businesses accept and manage digital payments. The focus now is on execution—building with intent, speed, and reliability.” RBI’s 25 bps rate cut to 6% and shift to an accommodative stance signals a growth-focused policy. I view this as positive for liquidity and demand recovery. Rate-sensitive sectors like banks, NBFCs, real estate, and autos stand to gain. While banks may see some NIMs compression (Fitch estimates ~10 bps in FY26), improved credit offtake could balance it. Lower rates should boost home and vehicle loan demand. However, global headwinds—especially rising US tariffs—pose risks to export-driven sectors like IT and pharma. Overall, a supportive step for domestic growth with some caution on external pressures. “We welcome the Reserve Bank of India’s mature and forward-looking move to adopt an accommodative policy stance, underpinned by a balanced view on inflation and growth. The repo rate cut, coupled with the commitment to maintain adequate liquidity, reflects a timely and prudent response to evolving macroeconomic challenges. This stance is a positive step toward reinvigorating demand and catalyzing investments across sectors. For the NBFC sector, in particular, it signals a conducive environment to deepen credit access and drive inclusive growth. We believe the proposed policy revisions will stimulate the banking and financial services ecosystem in the right direction and support the broader goal of sustaining a healthy and resilient economy.” Signature Global (India) Limited announced its highest-ever annual pre-sales of ₹10,290 crore for fiscal year 2025, surpassing company guidance with 42 per cent year-on-year growth. “We welcome the RBI’s decision to lower the repo rate to 6.00%, a move that reinforces its balanced approach toward fostering growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. At a time when global uncertainties persist due to trade disruptions and geopolitical developments, this proactive stance signals confidence in the country’s inflation outlook. The anticipated moderation in CPI inflation creates room for monetary support, and this rate cut is well-positioned to boost consumer confidence and enhance credit accessibility. For the housing sector, particularly the mid-income and affordable segments, improved affordability is expected to drive demand and support broader economic momentum.” RBI cut repo rate by 25 basis points as widely expected. RBI changed its stance to accommodative from neutral, which was not on expected lines given the global background. RBI seems to be comfortable with currency depreciation in the coming months. RBI has reduced its GDP growth forecast to 6.5 from 6.7 percent and CPI inflation has been revised to 4 from 4.2 percent. They highlighted future expectation of CPI over a 3 and 6 month time frame is lower. The governor highlighted lower commodity prices specially oil prices due to tariff war and on the growth downside due to lower investments by companies. RBI made it clear they will provide liquidity in the banking system to support growth Rate cuts in India is expected to be deeper to support growth as CPI inflation is below target of 4 percent for most of the year as per RBI projections. The terminal rate on repo can go towards 5.25 levels from 6 percent at present. The ten-year yields can move towards 6 to 6.25 percent in the coming years as globally growth slows down. The RBI has delivered what the market expected – a 25-bps cut and a change in stance to “accommodative”. It was also explained that being “accommodative” means that there would be no chance of a rate hike at this point, even as the RBI stays vigilant with the evolving macro scenario of tariff wars and geopolitical risks. Both inflation and growth forecasts were lowered by 20 bps. There were no fresh liquidity measures that were announced in this policy. The space for policy rate cuts were predicated by a decisive change in the inflation outlook, led by food prices and more specifically vegetable prices. Given projections by the Skymet of a normal monsoon, the risks to food inflation is likely reduced. At the other end of the spectrum, global growth risks have unleashed a sharp softening in crude oil and other commodity prices, and this is also a positive for India’s inflation dynamics. Overall, the confidence that inflation would remain aligned to the 4% target has magnified. Given a 4% inflation target, the scope of pushing repo rate down to 5.50% in this cycle has opened. Consequently, we expect the RBI to cut in June and also in August. “The RBI’s 25 bps rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6%, along with a shift to an accommodative stance, reflects a proactive policy response to escalating global trade uncertainty and rising export headwinds — notably as India’s merchandise exports have been contracted since November 2024. With CPI inflation softening and crude oil prices easing, the external disinflationary environment has provided the RBI with policy space for calibrated easing. This move not only cushions domestic demand but also offers timely support to MSMEs and corporates facing tighter global conditions while macroeconomic stability remains well-anchored by $676 billion in forex reserves” “Housing demand has been robust in the last 4-5 years, driven by stable macros, strong consumer sentiment, income and wealth growth. However, an increase in capital values has started impacting sales across segments. A further rate cut of 25 bps with an accommodative stance announced today, post a 25-bps rate cut in February 2025, is likely to further improve affordability. The falling interest rate cycle is likely to sustain consumer sentiment to some extent which has started seeing signs of weakening amid the current global turmoil and uncertainty.” “RBI’s Monetary Policy outcome was in line with consensus estimates and a 25 bps rate cut should augur well both for the financial system and the economy. Given the ongoing tariff war across the world, an accommodative stance along with a stable inflationary scenario would ensure buoyant credit growth and support our domestic environment. The rate cut is indeed positive for our bond markets but the ongoing pressure on the US bond yield restricts the full extent of the impact in India.” “The policy announcements come against the backdrop of increased volatility across asset classes, fear of a sharp global slowdown due to tariff shock. We believe the policy announcements were balanced and prudent, especially given the current uncertainties. The change in stance highlights the MPC’s resolve to support growth, as inflation risks have come down while risks to growth have increased. On the liquidity front, we expect the RBI to remain proactive and ensure sufficient liquidity conditions in the banking system. Going forward, we believe that the global growth outlook is expected to be highly uncertain and may have potential negative implications for our growth. Inflation is expected to be within MPC’s target of 4% due to lower crude, food. We expect the RBI to continue to provide required support to growth through various measures.” RBI Cuts Rates, Turns Accommodative: Growth is the Focus The RBI’s April policy action—a widely anticipated 25 bps rate cut taking the repo to 6.00%, alongside a shift in stance to ‘accommodative’—reflects a calibrated but decisive pivot toward supporting domestic growth amid escalating global uncertainties. With CPI inflation revised down to 4.0% for FY26 from 4.2%, and Q1FY26 inflation expected at just 3.6%, the real policy rate has widened to 2.4% (actual) and ~2.0% (forward-looking). This is materially above the RBI’s internal neutral real rate estimate of 1.4–1.9%, clearly indicating monetary space to ease further. Growth-wise, the RBI’s revision of FY26 GDP to 6.5% (from 6.7%) appears cautious, especially given strong underlying domestic fundamentals. Improving rural demand, resilient services exports, uptick in urban discretionary consumption, and accelerating investment momentum—driven by healthy corporate balance sheets and sustained public capex. Indeed, India remains an outlier in a decelerating global landscape, where tariff-induced frictions, manufacturing softness, and higher-for-longer rates are dragging global trade and investment activity. Inflation, on the other hand, is not just moderating—it is durably anchored. Headline CPI has averaged ~3.8% in Q4FY25, with vegetable prices registering a sequential decline for four consecutive months. NHB data points to a further 2% m-o-m decline in March, strengthening the disinflation narrative. A normal monsoon scenario could keep FY26 inflation in the 4% range, particularly given benign global commodity and crude trends (Brent below $70/bbl). Add to this China’s excess industrial capacity and weak global demand—both feeding into regional disinflation—and the inflation-growth mix for India is now the most conducive in years. On the liquidity front, RBI has managed a structural transition efficiently. After an average LAF deficit of ₹1.65 tn in Q4FY25, the system moved into surplus by March-end. Planned OMO purchases of ₹800 bn (₹200 bn each tranche) and an expected RBI dividend transfer of ₹2.5–3 tn in Q1FY26 will ensure that liquidity conditions remain conducive for rate transmission. With 60%+ of bank loans benchmarked to EBLR, policy transmission is more responsive than in prior cycles—50–75 bps of additional rate cuts could translate to 25–30 bps of GDP impulse via lower borrowing costs. Globally, policy uncertainty remains high. The U.S. tariff hikes (equivalent to a ~20% increase in average import duty) represent the steepest protectionist move in over a century. While India’s direct exposure remains modest—non-pharma exports to the U.S. are just ~1.4% of GDP—the broader impact of weaker global demand, tighter financial conditions, and deflated business confidence cannot be ignored. Yet, the lack of systemic financial stress, continued resilience in services exports and remittances, and a manageable current account trajectory (well below 2.0% of GDP) offer India insulation. In this context, the RBI has struck a prudent balance—neither flinching from external risks nor front-loading rate cuts aggressively. The shift to an accommodative stance, while decoupled from liquidity operations, signals policy optionality in favour of growth. We anticipate a cumulative 75–100 bps of further easing in 2025, contingent on monsoon outcomes, evolving global financial conditions, and inflation pass-through risks. The policy’s core message is subtle but strong: inflation containment is no longer the constraint; sustaining growth momentum without fuelling imbalances is now the monetary priority. The RBI has chosen to lead with calm conviction rather than reactive intervention—anchoring expectations while keeping its powder dry in an uncertain world. “The RBI’s move to cut the repo rate to 6 per cent and adopt an accommodative stance is a timely and growth-supportive measure. This decision is expected to inject greater liquidity into the market and bring down borrowing costs, thereby improving sentiment across the real estate sector. Amid global headwinds, including the recent U.S. tariffs of 26 per cent on Indian exports and a slower GDP growth rate of 6.5 per cent, this rate cut signals the central bank’s proactive approach to sustaining economic drive. With enhanced access to capital and improved investor confidence, the industry is poised to witness increased momentum in both residential and commercial segments. The move also reinforces trust in the RBI’s commitment to long-term financial stability, making this an opportune moment for buyers and investors to act with optimism.” Trade war escalates as US imposes 104% tariffs on Chinese imports •\u0009The US has put a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, raising tensions between the world’s two largest economies and causing market volatility. The White House acknowledged that the new tariff structure, which takes effect on April 9, follows President Donald Trump’s ultimatum to Beijing to reverse its retaliatory 34% taxes on American imports. •\u0009This adds to concerns that an all-out trade war could force the global economy into a recession, triggering a new wave of risk-aversion trading and reviving demand for the safe-haven gold price. •\u0009Investors increased their bets that a tariff-induced US economic slowdown would prompt the Federal Reserve to resume its rate-cutting cycle shortly. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that traders are pricing in a more than 60% possibility that the Fed will decrease borrowing costs in May. Furthermore, the US central bank is predicted to provide five rate cuts by 2025. Technical Triggers\u0009 •\u0009The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). •\u0009Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). “Undertaking a second successive step to ease policy, the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favour of a 25bp rate cut. In line with our view, the stance was revised to ‘accommodative’, reflecting policymakers’ comfort with the evolving inflation trajectory and providing room to support growth. This was reinforced by the modest downward revision in growth projections. Recent liquidity management measures have underscored the preference to maintain a surplus balance, thereby keeping the banking system well-oiled and aiding policy transmission. Overall, policy guidance remained dovish, while keeping an eye on global uncertainties and the consequent need to maintain stability in domestic financial markets. We expect a further 50bp of cuts this year.” Copper futures has seen a sharp drop in price recently. The continuous contract, after hitting a high of ₹922.20 on March 26, declined in the following sessions and closed at ₹797.85 on April 8, losing about 13 per cent. Copper futures experience sharp drop, with support at ₹790 and resistance at ₹825, traders advised to stay out. “The decision by RBI to reduce the repo rate to 6% is a welcome move as it aligns with broader goal of fostering economic growth. Pertaining to gold industry, the anticipated lower interest rates should further drive investor interest towards safe-heaven assets like gold, resulting into increasing momentum in the sector. We expect this to bolster the demand for gold. We believe that the monetary easing will encourage consumers and investors to consider gold as a safe bet amidst all the ongoing global uncertainties. With an approach to control inflation and borrowing costs reduced as well, we predict increased consumer spending power that will eventually benefit the gold industry.” The RBI has proven yet again that it is an ahead-of-the-curve central bank. The RBI has not only cut rates to support growth amid global turmoil, but also swiftly changed its stance from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Accommodative’. The policy change indicates the RBI is in a good position to cut rates if needed going forward. The RBI indicating that the inflation is benign, and the economic growth will be non-inflationary going forward, was one of the highlights of the policy. The RBI has done its part and delivered the much-needed relief to the industry on time. The government should make efforts to engage with the US government to find a solution to the trade tariff issue. The Indian economy remains strong, with key risks of a global slowdown due to trade tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and protectionism. “The RBI MPC meeting led by governor Sanjay Malhotra has announced a repo rate reduction of 25 basis points to a 6% cut .The rate has remained unchanged since February 2023. The rate cut will benefit homebuyers, since there will be a reduction in interest rates on home loans, leading to affordability. Loan EMIs will also reduce, which will be beneficial to refinance existing home loans.” Gold prices inched higher in the early Asian trade rebounding form a three-week low as investors sought safety amidst escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose to a one-week high reversing from recent low of ~4%, while dollar index stayed firm hovering around 103. In the previous session, rupee also depreciated sharply by ~40 paise supporting domestic prices. Concerns over a global trade war since U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on April 2 have raised fears of a slowdown and prompted investors to take refuge in the safe-haven assets like gold. In fresh updates regarding tariff war, President Trump to proceed with extra 50% tariff on China as trade war escalates. The tariffs will be especially steep for China, as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports to 104% to counter Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to “fight to the end”. Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds registered largest quarterly inflow in three years in January-March 2025, data from the World Gold Council showed. Market participants will now keep an eye on RBI policy meeting and FOMC meeting minutes. Focus this week will be on US CPI and PPI data. A 25 basis points rate cut by RBI is a welcome and timely move. It has reinforced the central bank’s commitment to support economic growth, especially at a time when inflation appears to be within manageable limits. A lower interest rate environment has always provided relief to businesses and consumers alike, potentially spurring credit demand, investments, and job creation. Rate cuts amidst tariff turmoil also signals that RBI sees enough macroeconomic stability to continue with an accommodative stance. However, we must ensure that this liquidity gets translated into tangible gains for sectors that need it most, particularly MSMEs, housing, and infrastructure. Economy should realize the full benefits of lower rates through policy support and sustained reform The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% during its April policy meeting, marking the second consecutive rate cut. This move, in line with market expectations, lowers borrowing costs to the lowest level since November 2022, amid easing inflation and slowing economic growth. The RBI revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2025-26 to 6.5%, down from 6.7%. The inflation projection was also lowered to 4% from 4.2%, remaining within the target range of 2-6%. Growth projections for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are 6.5%, 6.7%, 6.6%, and 6.3%, respectively, while inflation is forecasted at 3.6% in Q1, rising to 4.4% by Q4. With global uncertainties, this rate cut may support economic growth. The USD/INR pair is expected to trade between 86.00 and 86.90 next week, shortened by holidays. “The RBI’s decision to cut rates by another 25bps was largely on expected lines. It also changed its stance from neutral to accommodating. This paves the way for further rate cuts in the upcoming meetings. With inflation cooling off, the regulator has revised its inflation forecast for FY26 downwards to 4% vs 4.2% earlier. However, amidst global challenges, the GDP growth rate has also been tweaked downwards to 6.5% compared to 6.7% earlier. During the rate easing cycle, a general trend emerges: improved CASA ratios for banks. This has not been the case in Q4, with deposit growth being led by both CASA and TDs based on the provisional updates released by banks thus far. Systemic liquidity has been in deficit for the more significant part of the quarter, though it eased into surplus as banks exit Q4FY25. We expect the transmission on the CoF side to be slower vs the pace of transmission on the yields. Regarding margins for banks, we expect the full impact of the rate cut to reflect from Q1FY26, with a partial impact visible in Q4. We believe NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance, SBI Cards and Cholamandalam Inv. & Fin. would benefit not only from the rate cuts but also from the RBI’s decision to roll back the higher risk weight on bank loans to NBFCs. Amongst banks, we prefer large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and ICICI Bank”. “The awaited RBI MPC meeting announcement has arrived. The committee has announced a 25 basis point reduction to 6% from 6.25%. For homebuyers, it is a positive news, making it a lenient approach on the part of the committee. The reduction will make home loans and EMIs affordable. Homebuyers can also go for floating rate loans for more affordable housing.” Sandeep Bagla, CEO, TRUST Mutual Fund on RBI MPC: “RBI MPC cut repo rate by 25 bps, which was as per expected lines. It also changed its stance to neutral, which denoted that RBI is now unequivocal in its support of domestic growth and confident that inflation will move towards its desired rate of 4%. I expect the curve to steepen with the shorter end of the curve benefitting more. In the US, the tariff induced inflation fears are rising, which will lead to rising long bond yields. High global yields will influence the longer end bond yields in India as well.

With inflation pressures abating in the last several months and a repo rate already lowered to 6.25% in the previous meeting, the committee again must address a long-standing question of how to support growth while not permitting inflation pressures to run up again. The backdrop globally is still tense, as fears of trade wars and a potential global slowdown are pressing nerves. While there can be another small rate cut coming through, the views of the MPC would prefer an interim pause in order to allow time and space to properly evaluate the current backdrop. Attention may shift more towards financial stability measures and ensuring there is enough liquidity in the system. I feel the RBI will remain cautious, assessing how both global and domestic conditions play out before looking to intervene again.

Gold prices surged back above the $3,000 mark on Wednesday as mounting global trade tensions and rising recession fears drove investors toward safe-haven assets. The move comes amid escalating US-China tariff threats, with the White House confirming a 104% tariff on Chinese imports effective today. Markets are also pricing in multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, weighing on the US Dollar and supporting gold. However, rising US Treasury yields—fueled by speculation that China is dumping bonds in retaliation—could limit gains. Traders now await FOMC minutes and US inflation data later this week for fresh cues on the Fed’s rate path. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its stance to ‘accommodative’ reflects growing confidence in the disinflationary trend and a clear pivot toward supporting growth. The recent drop in CPI inflation to 3.62% in February well below the RBI’s mid-point target of 4% provides ample room for easing. While wholesale inflation inched up slightly to 2.38%, it remains within a manageable range, reinforcing the view that inflationary pressures are abating. This policy shift is likely to lower borrowing costs, boost liquidity, and support domestic demand—especially as fiscal measures and improving rural prospects kick in InCred Alternatives announced the ﬁnal close of its maiden private equity fund - InCred Growth Partners Fund-I. The fund has secured capital commitments in excess of ₹575 crore, well above its target size of ₹500 crore (after exercising the greenshoe option), with support from large family oﬃces, UHNI and HNI investors Given the changing world order, with significant tariff imposition by the US, global growth is likely to be impacted, which may have an impact on Indian growth also. RBI has moderated its GDP growth projection for FY2025-26 by 20 bps to 6.50%, similarly moderated its headline inflation projection to 4.00% (vs previously 4.20%). Keeping this growth-inflation dynamic in mind, Monetary Policy Committee (MCPC) of RBI has decided to further cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6% and change the stance to accommodative from neutral, indicating RBI will support the growth in this global uncertain times. We expect further 50 bps rate cut in next six months by RBI. Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato Ltd, saw its shares decline by 1.84 per cent in early trading today, with the stock priced at ₹211.30 on BSE and ₹211.22 on NSE as of 10:25 am. The RBI’s 25 basis points repo rate cut to 6.00%, coupled with a unanimous shift in stance to “accommodative,” signals a decisive pivot towards growth. With inflation expectations anchored FY26 CPI forecast now revised lower to 4% the central bank has found room to support demand without risking macro stability. Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s tone struck a balance: confident on domestic resilience, yet cautious of global headwinds. The US tariff escalations, weaker dollar, and volatile crude prices pose potential risks to India’s exports and imported inflation. Yet, the RBI believes the domestic economy is well-positioned to weather these shocks. GDP growth for FY26 is projected at 6.5%, with strong traction in agriculture, a revival in manufacturing, and healthy urban consumption. System liquidity has turned surplus in April crossing ₹1.5 lakh crore offering further tailwind to credit growth. This rate cut will likely translate into lower EMIs, spur home loan demand, and eventually stimulate private capex. Structural reforms continue in parallel, with gold loan norms and expanded co-lending frameworks aimed at improving credit delivery and financial stability. Despite some moderation in net FDI due to repatriation, India’s long-term story remains intact reflected in sustained capital inflows and a robust banking sector. In short, the RBI has signaled its intent: revive growth while keeping inflation in check. For equity markets and investors, this marks the start of a more supportive monetary cycle, aligning well with India’s long-term structural growth trajectory. Nifty Bank opened today’s session lower at 50,487 versus yesterday’s close of 50,511. It is now hovering around 50,320, down 0.3 per cent.

Time Published: 2025-04-08T22:29:13Z
Full Content:
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—such as options or futures—that have not been settled. It’s a measure of market activity and liquidity. In this chart, the metric is Open Interest / Market Cap, which shows how much derivatives trading (through open interest) exists relative to the total size (market cap) of the asset or company. Here’s what this means in practice: • SPY at 180.1%: The open interest in SPY options is 180.1% of SPY’s market cap. That signals extremely high speculative or hedging activity. • MSTR at 78.2%: MicroStrategy has a high level of speculative interest relative to its market size—likely due to its Bitcoin exposure. • AAPL at 3.2%: Apple has a much lower level of open interest compared to its market cap, which suggests less leverage/speculation relative to its massive size. Why it matters: • High open interest ratios can suggest heavy speculative positioning or hedging. • Low ratios might indicate a more passive investor base or less speculative attention. Would you like a deeper breakdown on how to interpret this in trading or investing terms? . Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures, that have not yet been settled or closed.

April 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Fourth Quarter Revenues Increase 25.7% to $33.6 Million at 27.0% Gross Margin Profile Completion of Strategic CapEx Projects and New Senior Hires Driving Robust Revenue and Margin Growth EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary “The fourth quarter of 2025 was highlighted by a robust 25.7% revenue growth, to a record $33.6 million, and the highest quarterly gross margin for the fiscal year at 27.0%, with the completion of CapEx investments to double our grilled chicken throughput, positioning us for the next leg up in growth, as reflected in the market share gains we saw this quarter,” said Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations. “Construction-related disruptions at our Farmingdale facility that had been impacting gross margins were firmly behind us in September, putting us back on track toward our near-term target in the high 20% range. While commodities and tariffs continue to put pressure on the macroeconomic environment, we have positioned ourselves well in anticipation of potential future macro headwinds. With over half of our expected protein needs for the new fiscal year locked in via fixed-price agreements, we are better prepared than ever to weather any macro headwinds. “Emphasis on our 4 Cs – Cost, Controls, Culture and Catapult – during the quarter was supported by continued automation and operational efficiency improvements across the organization. This included the aforementioned CapEx investments that were completed in September, as well as labor cost savings through a new lower overtime staffing model that was fully implemented in January, and additional procurement efficiencies and recent upgrades to our existing grills that will drive meaningful improvements in throughput. We continue to focus on selling new products that leverage the entire chicken breast, which allows us to trim more often, creating a cycle of higher gross margins through significant cost savings. By mid-year, we expect to trim most of our chicken in-house, from a small minority today. “Taken together, we believe we now have the world-class operational asset base and team in place to fully optimize operations, execute on our Catapult growth plan and identify, acquire and integrate future M&A opportunities. With these strong fundamentals, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge as a dominant player and a consolidator in the prepared foods space. Our marketing has grown to capture new customers, cohorts and occasions, and our team is selling with confidence and fulfilling pent-up demand. This has driven the robust 19.4% growth we saw in fiscal 2025, nearly double last year’s growth, all while building the foundation for an even stronger fiscal 2026,” concluded Michaels. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 25.7%, to $33.6 million, as compared to $26.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 19.4% to $123.3 million, as compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to volume gains driven by same-customer cross-selling of new items, high ROI trade promotions to drive higher velocities in existing customers and new customer door expansion. Targeted pricing actions were successfully put in place and implemented to ensure the Company maintained gross margin targets. Gross profit increased 16.1%, to $9.1 million, or 27.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $7.8 million, or 29.3% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $30.5 million, or 24.8% of total revenues, in fiscal 2025, as compared to $30.3 million, or 29.4% of total revenues, in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to commodity cost increases from historical averages as well as a non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now-completed installation of strategic CapEx projects at the Company’s Farmingdale, NY facility. Operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 21.3% from 21.9%. Operating expenses totaled $25.7 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2025 at 20.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter benefitted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by strategic new hires to build capabilities, as well as a 93% year-over-year increase in marketing spend across the entirety of the fiscal year – an area of historical underinvestment – to help drive repeatable and profitable growth. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net income for fiscal 2025 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled 4.8% of revenue, as compared to 5.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.7% to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.2 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $11.7 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 totaled to $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in strategic capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown year-to-date, partially offset by working capital improvements. As of January 31, 2025, total debt stood at $5.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million as of January 31, 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

Title: The Prompt: Microsoft Bets Big On Its AI Future
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/04/08/the-prompt-microsoft-bets-big-on-its-ai-future/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T20:01:55Z
Full Content:
ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt, Over the weekend, Meta released a cohort of new AI models called Llama 4, which it claimed perform better and more cost efficiently than OpenAI’s GPT4-o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 for tasks such as creative writing, coding and summarizing documents. One of these models, called Llama-4- Maverick, was benchmarked on the popular platform LM Arena, where people rate and compare AI models' answers. But what Meta benchmarked turned out to be different from the one it had publicly released to developers, TechCrunch reported. Instead, the social media giant benchmarked a more fine tuned version, several AI researchers noted on X and Meta mentioned in fine print in its own blog post. As a result, LM Arena said it is updating its policies for fair and "reproducible" model evaluations in the future. “Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” it posted on X. “As a result of that we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn’t occur in the future.” The fiasco has raised concerns about the company’s claims about its models’ performance being potentially misleading and points to the fact that these benchmarks aren’t always a reliable measure for AI’s capabilities. Now let’s get into the headlines. Last week, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 90 countries that shook the stock market. While those tariffs exclude semiconductors— the powerful chips that undergird AI models— they could make imports of essential materials like aluminium and structural steel more expensive and drive up the cost of building the massive data centers where AI models are trained, Forbes reported. “By the time we have developed the capacity to domestically produce these systems, we will have lost the AI race," Gavin Baker, chief investment officer at private equity firm Atreides Management said on X. AI might have also had a role to play in coming up with Trump’s trade policies, which resemble ChatGPT’s, Gemini’s and Grok’s breakdown of how the tariffs were calculated, Verge reported. The White House denied the claims and published what it said was its formula for the calculations. Shopify’s billionaire CEO Tobi Lutke said the e-commerce giant is changing its approach to hiring in the age of artificial intelligence. Teams will be required to demonstrate why AI can’t get the job done before asking for more resources and additional headcount, according to a memo sent to employees which Lutke posted on X. Shopify’s workers are also expected to use AI in their day-to-day jobs and their performance reviews will include questions about AI usage. New York City-based Runway, which develops AI models for video and image editing, raised $308 million. It’s now valued at over $3 billion, according to PitchBook and multiple reports. The company’s tools have been used to create scenes in Oscar-winning film Everything Everywhere All at Once. Runway’s AI software is used by tens of millions of users that include Hollywood filmmakers as well as budding artists, CEO Cristobal Valenzuela told me. The appeal? Runway’s easy to use tools. “You don't have to learn this complex 30-year-old software stack or creative tools that have been around for so long. You just can go from the idea to the final execution in a few minutes with Runway,” he says. A Microsoft sign is decorated in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary at Microsoft headquarters, Friday, April 4, 2025, in Redmond, Wash. (AP Photo/Jason Redmond) On Friday, Microsoft celebrated its 50th anniversary. The company behind the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office suite of applications like Word and Excel used the occasion to highlight its innovations in artificial intelligence, which ranges from its search engine Bing to coding tool GitHub copilot to its family of small-sized language models called Phi. It also announced new capabilities for Copilot, including in-depth research and the ability to carry out specific tasks on a person’s behalf. Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, a software which allows companies to build AI apps and what’s called “agents,” systems to carry out specific tech-related tasks, is used by some 60,000 customers, Microsoft announced. (The celebration was interrupted by employees who protested Microsoft allegedly selling its software and AI tools to the Israeli military. Microsoft terminated their employment, CNBC reported.) I spoke to Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for AI platform, Eric Boyd about how the company has evolved over the years. Boyd joined Microsoft in 2009 on the Bing team. Rashi Shrivastava: Is there a key moment in Microsoft’s history where you realized the significance of this technology and how it could change the way we work in the future? Eric Boyd: For me, it really crystallized when I saw probably GPT-3.5 and this was probably about six months before ChatGPT got released and we were just playing with it. But it hadn't really broken through to the mainstream. And I remember I was really almost frustrated at the time. I'm like, how come the whole company isn't taking a bet on AI and just refactoring, refocusing everything that they're doing. And then we saw GPT-4 a few months later and we did exactly that. Satya got all of the key leadership in the company into a room and said, ‘here we have this new technology and look at it, understand it, and he gave very specific instructions. I want you to come back with plans on how you're going to incorporate this in your products. We already have spellcheck–don't make spellcheck a little bit better. I want you to rethink the way that this is going to work in your products. Every team has plans and every team threw those plans out the window and came up with new plans for how they were going to refocus on this. And it was just an astounding pivot for the company that led to just this watershed where we realized things are going to be radically different. We're going to operate in a very different way. The world's going to be different as a result of that. Rashi: What is Microsoft's vision for AI in the future? Eric: Even if we kept doing just no new models, no new capabilities, no new functionality, there's at least five years of adoption to take advantage of the technology that we've already got. But we do have new things coming and I can ask a model to understand complicated things and do reasoning and give me answers back in a chat form. It’s going to change completely again as we move into a world where we expect these agents powered by models to go and do work for them and that I'm now going to be even more productive because I can assign sort of menial tasks. We now have AI that can do that mind numbing work really efficiently at massive scale and really well and just provide tremendous benefits to people. Rashi: Can we expect to see these agents in Microsoft products like Word and some of the other tools that we use in the future? Eric: I can't imagine that we wouldn't have that. I don't have anything to announce on that, but I definitely would expect that. Rashi: How has Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI evolved over the years? It seems like the company has been shifting away its reliance on OpenAI’s models to offer models from other companies like Mistral as well as build its own. Eric: “We have a really great partnership with Open AI and we continue to work really closely with them. I have literally 20 people in my team who are sitting at OpenAI's office each and every day working side by side with their engineers on the next things that we're looking to produce and move forward on. Our commitment to our customers is that we're going to give them the best frontier models produced by OpenAI along with the best models at each point at the price performance curve. I don't see that as a change really in our relationship with OpenAI. It's just making sure that we've got the full segment, all the segments in the market really covered. In some cases, AI’s medical decisions can be better than those of human doctors, according to a new study by digital health startup K and researchers at Cedars Sinai, Tel Aviv University. Forbes reported. The study, which reviewed 460 patent visits, found that K Health’s AI chatbot, which makes recommendations and diagnoses based on the patient’s medical records and conversations with the patient, matched the doctor’s decisions in two-thirds of cases and in the remaining one-third it offered better-quality care. A representative of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has moved through a string of federal agencies to reduce headcounts and slash budgets, appears to be trying to use an AI coding tool to write code for the Department of Veteran Affairs’ codebase, according to Wired. A DOGE hire called Sahil Lavingia, gained access to the department’s systems and is reportedly trying to digitize the organization with the introduction of AI tools for different uses.

Title: No proof Trump sold $2.3B in Truth Social stock before April 2 tariffs announcement

Time Published: 2025-04-08T19:44:00Z

About this rating There was no evidence, such as mandatory public filings or credible news coverage, that U.S. President Donald Trump sold his Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) shares before his April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. However, on April 1, TMTG did reregister for sale shares belonging to Trump and several other shareholders, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At close of market on April 1, Trump's 114,750,000 shares would have been worth roughly $2.3 billion. Following U.S. President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement (archived) on April 2, 2025, a claim circulated online that Trump sold $2.3 billion worth of his Truth Social stock the day before he unveiled the tariffs. (Facebook user Cor Poll) The rumor circulated as a screenshot of a social media post and appeared on X (archived), Facebook (archived) and Instagram (archived). Text in the screenshot read: "Trump sold 2.3 billon worth of his truth social stock the day before he announced the tariffs. And other stock as well. His family did the same. What does that tell everyone?" Snopes readers also emailed us to ask about the claim. It was not possible to locate the source of the screenshot, but it appeared to be from a Facebook post due to the image that featured in the background. However, there is no evidence, such as mandatory public filings, that Trump sold his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, before the April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. A spokesperson for a company representing TMTG described the claim as "false" and no credible news media outlets had reported on the president selling his shares as of this writing. Therefore, we have rated this claim as false. The rumor appeared to develop following a TMTG filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 1, 2025, in which TMTG reregistered certain shares — including 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust — for sale. According to the SEC filing, Trump was the "settlor and sole beneficiary" of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. was the trustee. The filing, formally known as a Form S-3 Registration Statement, registered the shares for "possible sale" but left shareholders in control of when or whether to sell. Shannon Devine, a partner at MZ North America, an investor relations and corporate communications company representing TMTG, said via email that rumors the president had sold his shares were "false." "There has been no sale of President Trump's shares," Devine wrote. Trump has previously said he would not sell his shares in TMTG. If the sale was legitimate, it would have been eminently newsworthy. However, using multiple search engines, it was not possible to find any credible news reports that the sale had gone through. In a statement on April 2, 2025, TMTG called reports that it was "paving the way" for Trump to sell his shares a "fake story." The company said (link below ours): Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares. The SEC defined an affiliate as "a person, such as an executive officer, a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer." Devine confirmed that Trump was an affiliate of TMTG. Trump's status as an affiliate is important because affiliates are subject to tighter trading rules than non-affiliates. According to the SEC, an affiliate of a company must report via Form 144 any sale that "involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period." Had Trump sold 114,750,000 shares worth around $2.3 billion as online claims suggested, this sale would need to be reported using Form 144. The form has been publicly available through the SEC's EDGAR system since 2022. There was no Form 144 reflecting the alleged sale on TMTG's EDGAR page at the time of this writing (archived). TMTG filed its Form S-3 with the SEC on April 1. Companies in the U.S. must file a Form S-3 registration statement if they wish to raise capital after their initial Form S-1 filing. The Form S-3 registration statement offers "securities" — in this case shares — to the market, meaning it puts them up for sale. On April 2, news media outlets such as Axios, the Financial Times (FT), Business Insider and Reuters reported that the SEC filing would allow Trump to sell TMTG stock worth $2.3 billion, referring to the 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The SEC filing itself did not value Trump's TMTG stock. Rather, according to Axios, the $2.3 billion figure for Trump's shares came from the value of TMTG shares — listed on the Nasdaq composite index as DJT — at market close on April 1 of $20.26 per share. Business Insider used a slightly lower price of $19.19 per share at midday on April 1 for its calculations. Following the SEC filing on April 1 and the news reports above on April 2, DJT stock on Nasdaq dropped from $20.26 at close on April 1 to $17.09 at close on April 4. By comparison, the lowest closing price for DJT stock in April 2024 was $22.84 on April 16. (Nasdaq) On April 2 and 3, 2025, respectively, TMTG wrote to Axios and the FT. TMTG said the outlets' reporting had caused an "immediate" and "severe" drop in TMTG's stock price. TMTG further wrote that Axios and the Financial Times had misrepresented the S-3 filing as an intent to sell. In its message to Axios, TMTG wrote: Crucially, the article completely omits the critical fact, as is stated in the S-3 filing itself, that the filing consolidates prior registration statements in the form of an S-3. The Trust shares, in fact, had been registered previously—as Axios also could have discovered through a search of Google, the SEC EDGAR system, or its own reporting—and the S-3 filing did not cause or reflect a change in the status of those shares. The omission of this fact allowed Axios to misrepresent the S-3 filing as an indication of a new intention by the Trust to sell its TMTG shares. This false implication was re-reported widely throughout the media, causing an immediate, severe drop in TMTG's stock price. In its communication with the FT, TMTG said: Despite its supposed expertise in financial matters, Financial Times also failed to note that it is customary and expected—and beneficial to shareholders—for a U.S. public company to shift from S-1 to S-3 when it becomes eligible to do so. DJT was not the only large social media parent company to lose value in the days after "Liberation Day" on April 2. The stocks of Meta (Facebook and Instagram's parent company), Pinterest and Snap Inc. (photo messaging app Snapchat's parent company) all dropped between April 2 and April 7. Berkowitz, Ben.

Slate, which took root in another Bezos-connected company called Re:Build Manufacturing, has been operating quietly since its founding in 2022. The company has hired hundreds of employees while in stealth — many of whom come from Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, and Harley-Davidson. It also attracted the backing of several other wealthy individuals, including Mark Walter, the controlling owner of the LA Dodgers and CEO of Guggenheim Partners, and Thomas Tull, who is a lead investor of Re:Build Manufacturing, according to documents TechCrunch obtained from Delaware’s Division of Corporations. Slate Auto is tackling a big goal: an affordable two-seat electric pickup truck for around $25,000, according to two sources who were granted anonymity to speak about the company’s internal discussions. Leaders inside the company have mentioned the Ford Model T or Volkswagen Beetle as a North Star for the project, according to the people. It has amassed a sizable war chest in service of that goal. The company quietly raised at least $111 million in a Series A round in 2023, according to a public filing. Bezos was involved, and Melinda Lewison, the person who manages his family office, is listed as a director on paperwork Slate has filed with states and the federal government. The filing shows 16 people invested in that round; it is unclear how much Bezos put into the company. Slate has told employees that it closed a Series B late last year, according to multiple sources familiar with its funding. It has not yet filed any paperwork for the round with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Delaware paperwork shows it authorized nearly 500 million preferred shares for the Series B priced at $2.37 per share. (Slate also authorized more than 400 million shares of common stock in the past year, though the filings did not state a price.) The Delaware paperwork also lists Walter and Tull as new board members, suggesting the two invested in Slate’s Series B round. The two recently formed a $40 billion holding company to make investments. Walter and Tull could not be reached for comment. Slate hopes to get its vehicle into production as soon as late 2026 at a manufacturing facility somewhere near Indianapolis, Indiana, according to job listings, state lobbying records, and a 2024 interview with executive chairman Rodney Copes. It is not immediately clear if Slate purchased an existing factory or plans to build one from scratch. The clandestine project is taking shape at a challenging time for electric vehicles. Once-explosive growth of the sector has cooled off, and multiple startups dedicated to building EVs have filed for bankruptcy. Those that have survived, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, have done so by burning through billions of dollars. Slate plans to supplement the small margins of its low-cost truck by building out a line of accessories and apparel that owners can use to customize their vehicles and their looks, according to the sources and various job listings. It has filled its executive ranks with former Harley-Davidson and Stellantis employees — two companies that have historically leaned on these kinds of ancillary businesses (the former with apparel and the latter with MoPar parts and accessories). Slate is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and the startup has also shown off a proof of concept vehicle to investors at a non-descript design studio it’s leasing in Long Beach, California, according to the sources. It has targeted high-net-worth individuals and kept a tight lid on its fundraising process. The company and multiple people connected to Slate, Re:Build Manufacturing, and Bezos’ family office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story. TechCrunch also reached out to Bezos directly and did not receive a response. Slate is shot through with Amazon DNA. Alongside Bezos’ family office, Slate’s Series A included funding from former Amazon executive Diego Piacentini, according to his firm’s website. Slate was initially created as a project called Re:Car in early 2022 within Re:Build Manufacturing, a domestic manufacturing incubator of sorts co-founded by former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke and his MIT Leaders for Global Operations classmate Miles Arnone. Several long-time Amazon executives, including Wei Gao, who was a top VP and technical adviser to Bezos, are now at Re:Build Manufacturing. Slate’s digital, e-commerce, and automotive experience leads are Amazon expats. Even Slate’s original name includes the “re:” prefix Amazon uses for events, like the re:MARS robotics and AI conference, or the annual re:Invent gathering for AWS. Bezos has invested in more than 30 companies through his family office over the years, touching the worlds of AI (Perplexity), robotics (Figure), defense (Anduril), and even mobility (Uber). Slate is one of the most direct investments he’s made in the world of electric vehicles outside of the relationship his company Amazon has with Rivian. His investment has largely been just that, though. People familiar with the company’s inner workings told TechCrunch that he has not been seen around Slate’s Michigan or Los Angeles offices. Nearly all of the EV startups that have come (and gone) over the last decade have tried in some way to replicate the approach Tesla took. They’ve designed their first vehicles to be high-end offerings so they can sell fewer cars for more money. Eventually, after growing brand awareness, these companies move into higher-volume, cheaper EVs that generate smaller margins. Slate is inverting this by going after what it hopes will be a buyer’s “first car,” according to the people who spoke with TechCrunch. The idea is to sell the truck at a price point of around $25,000, and have owners personalize or upgrade the car over time as they can afford it. In late March, Slate filed for a trademark on the phrase: “WE BUILT IT. YOU MAKE IT.” There is a long list of goods and services it could cover, including everything from switches and speakers to USB ports and pet harnesses. Other details can be gleaned from the many job listings Slate has posted over the last two years. One posted in 2024 hinted the company will dub the customer customization process “Slate University.” The listing was originally titled “University Lead” and was renamed to “Head of Customer Education Repair & Maintenance” before the startup stopped accepting applications. “We seek an enthusiastic, experienced Leader of Slate University to build and lead our game-changing approach to open-source content for customers to enhance their ownership experience,” the listing reads. “As the Lead, you will drive the strategy and ecosystem development for the educational content and delivery for Slate shoppers, customers, technicians, and partners.” Another job listing for “Lead Product Manager, Accessories” explains that Slate is “exploring opportunities in the electric mobility space and are building complimentary accessories, apparel, and merchandise capability.” It also mentions the person would be overseeing the development of “utility parts” and “lifestyle and personalization accessories.” This approach — subsidizing a low-margin manufacturing business with a higher-margin accessories play — is one that has been used by automakers, including Harley-Davidson with its apparel division and Jeep-maker Stellantis with its Mopar parts and service division. Unsurprisingly, Slate is already pulling experience from both of those companies as it builds out its team. The startup’s executive chairman is Rodney Copes, who spent 20 years at Harley-Davidson. Chief Financial Officer Ryan Green spent nearly a decade on the finance side of the motorcycle manufacturer. (Copes and Green also had stints at Rivian.) Slate’s heads of service, commercial, accessories product management, and growth marketing also worked at Harley-Davidson. Slate apparently plans to source its high-voltage battery pack, electric motors, and other related tech from outside suppliers, according to one job listing. The startup is “challenging the status quo of vehicle design,” according to another listing for a design/release engineer for windshield wipers. A posting for an accountant role says the person hired would have to help implement the “required systems to be a public company.” According to another role, any prospective head of PR and communications: “Must love cars! You’ll be thinking about cars all day every day, and it’s the most fun when you love cars.” Another way Slate appears to be bucking the trend of other EV startups is that it does not have a founder serving as CEO. Arnone is considered to be Slate’s founder, according to the sources who spoke to TechCrunch, but his day-to-day job is serving as CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing. Instead, Slate’s CEO is Christine Barman, a longtime Chrysler veteran. She initially got into the automotive industry through an internship at General Motors after attending Purdue University, according to a 2023 interview. She then spent more than 20 years at Chrysler overseeing the vehicle line program for the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Jeep Cherokee, according to her LinkedIn profile. Barman eventually became the vice president of electrical and electronics for Fiat Chrysler, where she led the automaker’s integration of Android Automotive and spent time working on the company’s collaboration with Waymo, before leaving the company in 2017. Barman has not spent the last decade posting online like many of her EV startup CEO peers. She instead has mostly been advising companies on emerging tech and teaching engineering before getting involved in 2022 with what at the time was a nascent EV project within Re:Build Manufacturing. Barman did not respond to a request for comment. Kirsten Korosec contributed to this report.

(Reuters: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool) Wealthy tech bros, former Playboy bunnies and Australian miners are turning on Donald Trump as the fallout continues from new tariffs he imposed on America’s trading partners late last week. The US president often says "tariff" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool. Business leaders who previously donated to Trump’s campaign or showed support for the US president during his re-election bid have criticised the widespread tariffs, which have plunged the global stock market into chaos. The tariffs were designed to deal with "the highest trade imbalances" with the United States and were wide-ranging measures taken in a bid to prioritise US manufacturing. However their sweeping nature has sparked fears of a global recession as investors sell off trillions of dollars' worth of stocks. Even with a two per cent rebound on Tuesday, Australian stocks had still lost more than five per cent - or over $100 billion - in value since last Wednesday's close. Meanwhile the world’s 500 richest people suffered the biggest two-day loss ever recorded on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, losing a collective $887 billion. Business men and women who have previously backed Mr Trump’s policies and election platform have since turned on him, with some suffering billions of dollars wiped off their overall net worth. Here's how much went missing One of Trump’s most famous advisers and the chief executive of Tesla has taken the biggest hit so far. Musk was already on a downward spiral following the boycotting of his products due to his close association with the president and his administration, but it was earlier this week that has dealt him his biggest blow yet. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index found Musk has lost $US31 billion ($51 billion) over the two-day drop, bringing his net worth to under $US300 billion for the first time since he ascended the rich list. However, the loss is not too damning for Musk – who remains clear of other billionaires to still retain his top spot as richest man in the world. Musk has not publicly reacted to the news of his losses, but he has lashed out at Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro over his defence of tariffs. He posted on X and said: “PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing”. Musk also later responded in agreement to a quote from economist Thomas Sowell: “In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it”. However, he has also shared content from the United States Trade Representative X account highlighting “unfair trade practices imposed on American exporters”. E-commerce giant and recently-turned media mogul Jeff Bezos has fared a little better than Musk across the two-day drop. The Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index found the Amazon founder had lost about $US24 billion to date. Bezos has likely lost out due to the major stock market sell-off that was triggered by escalating tariff tensions, and analysts say Amazon’s reliance on manufacturers in places like Taiwan and China could make it vulnerable in the trade war. He remains the second richest person in the world. The creator of Meta was a fixed presence throughout Trump’s campaign and joined forces with both Bezos and Musk to signal support from the technology sector. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, he lost about $US28 billion over the same period as Musk and Bezos. Like Bezos, Zuckerberg’s core business is heavily reliant on manufacturing in countries like India and China. It also relies on advertising revenue to survive, which could be impacted by any potential recession or economic slow-down. Zuckerberg has previously flagged his support for tariffs, expressing concerns European and Australian companies were unfairly targeting American tech companies with regulatory action. Just last month, he said the US government should be defending its own manufacturers and business owners against international penalties, however he has yet to comment on how the tariffs have impacted him personally. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has been the most outspoken about the impact of Mr Trump’s tariffs. He had a net worth of $US9.3 billion earlier this year, which has since fallen to $US8.8 billion — although the precise figure he lost during the market slump is not publicly available. Ackman took to X to criticise the implementation of the tariffs. "The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out," he wrote. “This is not what we voted for.” Ackman is the manager of Pershing Square Holdings. He said Mr Trump was risking an "economic nuclear war" and criticised his key advisers and their understanding of economics. "We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," he wrote. "What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?" Closer to home is the Hancock Prospecting billionaire. Rinehart is the richest person in Australia and supported Trump throughout his first presidency in 2016. She has pushed for similar policies in Australia around removing "red tape" and a US-style department of government efficiency. Rinehart's support of the US has continued through her buying up shares in Elon Musk’s Tesla and local oil and gas companies. Rinehart's net worth according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index is about $40 billion, but the Australian Financial Review said her fortune had dropped by $280 million since the market’s downturn. Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting sells a lot of its iron ore to major trading partner China, but she has yet to comment on the implementation of tariffs on the steel markets. Hendricks is one of Trump’s most prolific donors and her net worth is about $US20.9 billion. A former Playboy bunny, Hendricks made her fortune co-founding building products distributor ABC Supply Co, which is one of the country’s largest wholesale distributors of roofing, siding and windows. The nature of the business means tariffs will likely see the price of ABC’s products increase. Early estimations by Forbes found her company would likely lose about $US650 million as the market falls. While Ms Hendricks has not commented on the impact of tariffs personally, her company issued a statement to Newsweek about their potential impact back in March, before they were announced: “We understand that ongoing market conditions, including rising raw material costs and evolving tariffs, continue to create challenges in our industry,” the company stated on March 18. “This prior week, we have begun receiving price increase notifications from our suppliers. “As a result, ABC Supply will be adjusting pricing accordingly in line with the announced increases as they come into effect.” The pain isn't over anyone — for billionaires nor the less-affluent — although some economic analysts said the sliding stock market is losing steam. Australian shares closed higher on Tuesday, with the ASX 200 gaining 2.3 per cent and all sectors rising after the sessions of heavy selling. However the Dow Jones continues to struggle as Mr Trump doubled-down on his implementation of tariffs. "The long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place [sic]," he wrote on X.

Please try again Silicon Valley companies, especially those that rely heavily on international supply chains, have seen their stocks drop precipitously since President Trump revealed his tariff plan on April 2. A 10% tariff on all imported goods went into effect on April 5 and higher tariffs on specific countries (like China and Mexico) are scheduled to begin on April 9. While it’s unclear whether all the tariffs are here to stay, companies are already acting as if Trump will deliver on his threats in the long term. More of Apple’s iPhones, famously constructed from parts sourced all over the world, may soon be assembled in India to sidestep Chinese tariffs that could raise the hardware cost of the iPhone 16 Pro by $300 each.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years. Missing from the public conversation, in news articles and social media, are the direct voices of tech company leaders. This is in large part due to fears of attracting negative attention from the Trump administration. “CEOs with large global supply chains can’t be outspoken on this topic publicly because they need to cut deals,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, wrote on social media platform X. “But this is the tone of the convos happening right now,” he added, reposting pointedly negative comments about the tariffs from tech analyst Dan Ives. “If these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold, there is no debate … it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner,” Ives wrote. Ives continued, “In one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs … and slow down US tech innovation.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.

Title: Apple's China exposure makes it most vulnerable in US-China trade war

A hot potato: Global financial markets posted three consecutive days of losses as the trade war between the U.S. and the rest of the world escalated. The tech sector has been hit particularly hard by President Trump's tariffs, with all major U.S. tech companies losing a significant portion of their market value. Apple has seen the hardest hit, shedding nearly 20 percent of its market cap in one of the steepest declines in the company's history before a mild recovery on Tuesday. While most major American tech companies have much to lose in a global trade war, Apple – the world's largest by market cap – is the most vulnerable of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" due to its heavy reliance on China. Most of Apple's products, including its best-selling iPhone models, are manufactured in the communist nation, meaning the proposed 50 percent tariffs would affect it more severely than most. Related: Consumers race to Apple stores as tariff fears spark iPhone rush Apple also has manufacturing partners in Vietnam, Thailand, and India, but those countries are facing increased tariffs under Trump's new plan as well. Since Apple does not currently manufacture any of its products in the U.S., analysts believe that if the proposed tariffs are enacted, the company will either have to absorb the additional costs or raise prices – potentially reducing its profit margins or losing market share. According to UBS analysts, the tariffs could increase the price of the flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max by as much as $350 if Apple chooses to pass the cost on to consumers. Despite the downturn, tech stocks staged a mild rebound on Tuesday. Hopes that President Trump might delay or soften the proposed tariffs helped lift investor sentiment. Out of the big tech "Magnificent Seven" Nvidia led the recovery with a gain of about 4%, while Meta, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet rose around 1-3%. Source: Companies by Marketcap However, the broader picture remains shaky, underscoring ongoing concerns about the impact of a prolonged trade war. Last Thursday, rumors of a potential tariff delay triggered a volatile trading session, but not before the "Magnificent Seven" lost a staggering $1.8 trillion in market value in mere days. Apple's stock plummeted nearly 20 percent over the past three sessions, wiping out nearly $640 billion in market cap. The stock is up three percent in early Tuesday trading, but still down more than 16 percent over the last five days. Meanwhile, Brazilian media is speculating that Apple could shift iPhone production to Brazil to avoid the proposed tariffs on China. While Apple has not commented on these rumors, Brazil currently faces only a 10 percent tariff under the Trump administration's new plan – far less than India, which would be subject to a 26 percent tariff. Apple has been assembling products in Brazil in partnership with Foxconn since 2011. However, these facilities primarily serve the local market with entry-level models.

Title: American Consumers Are Resilient, Ready To Adapt To Tariff-Driven Price Increases

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Close-up on a woman shopping at a convenience store and checking her receipt while exiting As the stock market implodes in real time, American consumers are responding with a pragmatic acceptance of what’s coming, ready to adjust as necessary. Having already navigated a period of hyperinflation, they will apply the same shopping strategies they honed then to adapt to anticipated tariff-induced price increases. Since 2020, Americans have been on a roller coaster where prices are concerned. The consumer price index rose from an average of 1.2% in 2020 to 8% in 2022 then dropped to a still high 4.1% in 2023. Americans got a reprieve in 2024, ending at 2.9% and inflation dropped further to 2.8% in February. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the March inflation data in a few days. Shoppers adapted then – retail and food service reciepts rose from $7.4 trillion in 2021 to $8.5 trillion in 2024. And they will adapt now. “In a moment of economic tension, consumers’ quiet resilience may be the more important signal for brands to pay attention to,” said Natalie Griffith, director of cultural insights at research firm Collage, which just conducted a survey among 1,000+ Americans about the pending impact of tariffs. Overwhelmingly, consumers expect tariffs to impact prices, according to 76% of the 2000+ voters surveyed by Morning Consult for the National Retail Federation. While 37% believe governmental policies should cut the trade deficit, there is much broader support (75%) for the government to prioritize bringing down the cost of groceries and everyday goods this year. Yet, Americans are nearly equally divided as to whether the tariffs will hurt them a lot (38%) or hurt a little (31%), according to a survey among 1,645 consumer by YouGov for the Hoover Institution. However, consumers’ feelings break along demographic lines. Men tend to skew toward hurt a little (36%), while more women are in the hurt-a-lot camp (41%). And significantly more Black Americans expect tariffs to hurt them a lot (49%) versus White (35%) or Hispanics (36%). Notably, 14% in this survey are unsure. Nearly half of consumers believe they are already feeling the impact of tariffs on the prices they are paying, according to the Collage survey conducted in March before the tariffs were even announced. Experts say it will take a few weeks to months for price changes to show up at the cash register. Yet, a skeptical few (29%) believe that some companies have taken advantage of the current situation to raise prices and boost profits. For example, AutoZone CEO Phillip Daniele said in September’s earnings call that as tariff policies have “ebbed and flowed over the years,” that “we generally raise prices ahead of that.” Such anticipatory price increases are not a good idea and brands that do so will leave consumers with a bad taste in their mouths once the dust settles. “Tensions and resentment are high due to what many see as about to happen to the economy,” shared Collage’s Griffith. Given consumers’ anxieties, brands and retailers must work to calm fears and reduce consumer tension so they don’t negatively react as we are seeing Wall Street do now. The Collage survey found that 72% of consumers are already adjusting in anticipation of price increases. They are: In addition, they are delaying major purchases (23%), such as cars, electronics and appliances, stocking up before prices increase (22%) and buying second-hand goods (16%). These are value-hacking strategies that have served them well over the last few years. As McKinsey describes it, consumers are operating in a “value now” mode, not just shopping for the best price but choosing to optimize the value of their purchases. And by optimizing on day-to-day purchases, they can occasionally treat themselves, striking a balance between compromises and indulgences. The Collage survey confirms the “value now” approach. Some 53% of consumers said quality was extremely important when choosing between one product over another, compared with 48% who prioritize price. Brand reputation or trust also plays a leading role (30%), and so does their past experience with the brand (31%). In addition, over 70% say they are willing to pay more for higher-priced goods made in America – 40% if the price difference is small and 31% regardless of the price difference. “While we did find that patriotism is helping on the consumer side,” Griffith acknowledged, “it only applies if the value is clear and the product is superior. Quality and price still matter most.” As the “value-now” shopper adapts to the new tariff-shaped shopping economy, retailers and brands can alleviate sticker shock by being transparent and forthright about why prices are changing. “Consumers expect brands to be transparent about price hikes and nearly half said they’ll stay loyal if brands explain the ‘why’ and share some of the burden,” Griffith explains. Over 40% expect brands to absorb some of the increased costs instead of passing it all along to customers. For example, Walmart and Costco are leaning on Chinese suppliers to cut prices so they don’t have to burden their shoppers. And Chipotle has promised to keep prices level as long as possible even given the hit to avocado prices coming from Mexico. Offering discounts or promotions will help reinforce brand loyalty with 44% saying such incentives would make them more likely to continue purchasing. Ford is on it by offering employee discount prices to all new car buyers and Stellantis has followed suit for its Jeep, Ram and Chrysler brands. In uncertain times like these, the resilience and adaptability of American consumers will be on full display. “Consumers aren’t overreacting, but they are recalibrating,” Griffith said. Retailers and brands must do the same. They should find ways to minimize price hikes through supply chain efficiencies and selective pricing strategies. In other words, suck up some of the tariff costs, rather than passing them all along. By clearly and honestly explaining price changes, retailers and brands can reassure customers that their concerns are heard and their needs remain a priority. In these uncertain times, empathy is key — and by prioritizing customer needs, brands and retailers can foster trust and loyalty that will carry them through. See also:

Title: How Businesses Are Dealing With Impending Tariffs

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Tariffs have dominated the thoughts, discussions and decisions of business executives, investors and economists just about as soon as President Donald Trump took office. Hours after being sworn in on January 20, he announced his intention to start 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even though these tariffs were initially delayed a month, they took effect—and the world’s businesses knew Trump’s threats were solid. As much of the world prepares to begin paying new tariffs of at least 10% tomorrow, businesses have taken different steps to assess and control the impact on their businesses, revenues and sales. Klarna and StubHub were both planning to IPO, but decided to put their market debuts on hold due to ongoing volatility. Nintendo, already facing scrutiny for the higher-then-expected $449.99 price for its new Switch 2, decided to push back last Friday’s pre-order date for the game console, citing the need to better assess levies and market conditions. Volkswagen will add an “import fee” to cars sold in the U.S. starting later this month, the New York Times reports, and is holding off on imports while it figures out tariffs. Then there are companies and industries experts are confident can get through this period with few problems. Forbes’ Phoebe Liu writes Amazon is likely to do well, largely because it has the infrastructure already in place to shift pricing to consumers and sellers and deliver items quickly and efficiently. While Amazon’s prices are likely to take a hit, analysts told Liu, everyone else’s prices will experience the same, so Amazon will perform relatively well. The National Retail Federation also delivered a sanguine forecast for the industry, saying they expect no tariff-related changes to their annual forecast, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The retail group isn’t ignoring the impact of tariffs, and they acknowledge that consumer and business confidence may be dropping, but NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said it’s not time to count out the American consumer. As uncertainty persists, finance departments are looking to save their businesses money wherever possible. And even though fewer M&A transactions are going forward this year than predicted, some dealmaking is taking place. One area that’s often overlooked—and can be quite costly—is third-party service contracts. I talked to Nate Buniva, a partner at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe , about how not to lose money on contracts in a transaction. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. It’s spring break season and we’ll be taking next week off from Forbes CFO. We’ll be back on Tuesday, April 22. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Stocks rallied slightly Tuesday morning over a bit of optimism that Trump may be willing to cut tariff deals. He wrote on social media that he had a “great call” with South Korea’s Choi Sang-muk, and “China also wants to make a deal, badly.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on CNBC that he believes “we can end up with some good deals” if other companies come to the table. Regardless, Wall Street has not reacted well to the idea of tariffs. Since Trump’s announcement, the Nasdaq is down 8.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 7.8%, and the S&P 500 is down 8.3% Warnings are incoming from many economists and banks. JPMorgan Chase issued 60% odds of a recession, labeling Trump’s policies as the “largest tax increase” since 1968, which will “fall heavily on the US consumer.” Goldman Sachs increased their recession odds to 45% on Sunday, and cautioned that unless Trump capitulated, recession is their baseline economic forecast. UBS Investment Bank chief strategist Bhanu Baweja described the economic issue with tariffs as “a manmade problem, concentrated really around one man.” And if Trump were to change his mind, “suddenly the whole algebra changes.” Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov surveyed 50 top Wall Street investors, more than half of whom initially supported Trump’s policies, and found that their confidence in him is gone. Nearly three-quarters say his plan has been ineffective, and 54% of former supporters say he is failing. At the very least, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman, Trump’s tariffs are risking the U.S.’s reputation as a stable and predictable global partner for trade and investment—something that might be extremely difficult to get back in the years when Trump is out of office. Federal employees rally in support of their jobs last month outside a federal building in Chicago. Unemployment is climbing, according to figures from the Labor Department last week. In March, the U.S. added 228,000 non-farm jobs, more than economists’ estimates of 140,000. But unemployment was up to 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% forecasts. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a 60% increase in March layoffs, with more than 275,000 jobs eliminated last month. Nearly 80% of those cuts were in federal government jobs through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Last month’s numbers were the highest since Covid-19 pandemic-related cuts in spring 2020. Court orders have directed the federal government to rehire more than 26,000 of those terminated employees so far, but the government is continuing to appeal and most of the employees appear to be on paid administrative leave for the time being, CBS reports. However, Trump continuously touts his tariffs as a job creator: Companies will be drawn to start manufacturing products in the U.S. again, so they will build factories that will employ Americans. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that’s an inaccurate way to look at the situation. Manufacturing has always been alive and well in the U.S., and the industry is at record-high levels from a productivity standpoint. Many items that are not manufactured in the U.S. today are inexpensive or commodity products, which is keeping with the country’s development as technology improves. Even if lower-level manufacturing comes back to the U.S. as a result of tariffs, it takes years to plan, build and staff a factory, so changes are years away. A sign at a Capital One Café in Miami. The $35 billion merger of Capital One and Discover made it past the Justice Department’s antitrust review, bringing the deal closer to the finish line, according to multiple reports. When the deal was first announced in February 2024, many analysts questioned if it would go through. President Joe Biden’s administration halted several mergers for antitrust reasons, including JetBlue’s planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and Kroger’s planned purchase of Albertsons. The New York Times reports that in January, before Trump’s inauguration, Biden’s Justice Department had drafted an interim memo that outlined concerns that the Capital One-Discover tie-up could harm consumers. The merger is not a done deal yet. It still needs approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analysts believe the Justice Department would be the most likely to object; the Times writes the Federal Reserve hasn’t denied a bank merger application since 2003. But if this goes through, it’s the first big financial deal that will have made it through the Trump Administration’s brand of scrutiny. Nate Buniva, partner at West Monroe. Every business has third-party contracts for services and IT platforms, which can often be forgotten during an M&A transaction. Nate Buinva, a partner at management and technology consulting firm West Monroe, is an expert at paying attention to these contracts—which he said can save 40% to 60% in a transaction if managed correctly. I talked to him about how to properly handle third-party contracts on both sides of an M&A deal. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Are there any types of contracts that tend to be overlooked more than others? Buniva: It’s a lot of work to read the T’s and C’s of these large enterprise agreements and understand what it can mean from a dollars and cents perspective. Often the contract piece does get overlooked or just not talked about. It’s like: This is what we spend on our ERP, this is what we spend on our collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams, but there’s not always that double click of: In this merger, do we have the right to terminate one agreement and get [the new entity] on the other, or are we going to be held with double cost? Reading through these legal documents is not the most exciting, and M&A transactions move quickly, too. You have to do the 80/20 rule, and get up to speed quickly on what you have, and make educated decisions to move forward. Is there anything that companies planning to be involved in an M&A transaction in the near future should consider when they get into contracts? Absolutely. You want to put in clauses that contemplate where you have the ability to scale the way you can structure your pricing in a tiered fashion, whereas volume goes up, you see a preferred discount on a per-unit level. Let’s say you currently only have 100 service requests right now, and you would do a tier that would take you up into the thousands. The reason you’re tiering it so high, when you do acquire a new company, you are already set up with your existing providers at a price point that says: I want you to honor this discount because I’m bringing you this extra volume. You don’t want to be in a position of doing that acquisition and you’re paying the 100-unit rate, but your volume’s 1,000. You can put in change-of-control language that says pricing or the terms need to be reevaluated if there is a change of control and you’re being sold off or absorbed. Even if you're not contemplating a transaction in the future, you never know what’s going to happen. You may as well put it in. More and more vendors are open to that because in general, yes, they may have to provide more discounted pricing, but they want the additional volume. What advice would you give to a CFO on either side of a transaction? It takes a dedicated team. My guidance is to make sure you’ve cleared people's bandwidth internally and do a review of your third-party agreements. I would also recommend they bring in an expert externally to look at this stuff and build an inventory. Oftentimes, your procurement, IT or finance orgs don’t necessarily have the subject matter expertise. Your legal team will know what contractual rights you’ll have, but they don’t know where the market is on what you can negotiate out of or what tools you can use. Every department has their own contracts. If you don’t have it, build a centralized database. You’re going to want to look at when does the contract end? How much are you spending? What’s the service? Do you have termination rights? As you contemplate the transaction, you need to start talking with the other entity about what they have and where there’s overlap, or if you're being sold off, what gaps will you have as a new entity where you need to now go stand up your own agreements. All of that takes a lot of time and runway, so the other piece of advice is do it ASAP. Where you don’t want to be—and this is when we’ve been called in the past—is at the end hour: Oh my gosh, we’re going to be a standalone company next month. We don’t have a Microsoft agreement. We can do that, but if it had been a more thoughtful journey, then you can get better pricing, terms, service levels, all of that stuff across all of your services. Oftentimes CFOs are focused on what’s the cost synergy, the headcount reduction or the opportunity to scale this business? But third-party spend is a huge component of that. Elon Musk, who is slashing government spending through DOGE, has spoken out against tariffs. Forbes’ John Hyatt examines how much Musk’s business empire has to lose through the new taxes levied by Trump. 20%-25%: Proportion of car parts Tesla imported last year from nations excluding Canada. About 40% of battery materials come from Chinese suppliers $68 million: Value of a Starlink contract canceled by Ontario Premier Doug Ford in response to Trump’s trade war. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, does business in more than 125 countries ‘Economic Armageddon’: How Dan Ives, global head of technology research for Wedbush Securities, described the tariffs’ impact on the automobile industry, including Tesla As DOGE rampages through the federal government, billions of dollars in grant money and contracts are being cut. Here are 10 things all federal contractors should do, both those who are seeing funding canceled and those who may yet be on the chopping block. Even though many CFOs and CIOs say they work well together as a unified team, there are often serious differences when it comes to ownership and ROI for tech investments, and that can lead to botched tech rollouts. Here are some tips to improve that relationship for maximum success. Last week, a CEO used profanity on a live interview with CNBC as he reacted to his company’s stock price falling after a poor earnings report and Trump’s tariff announcement. In the days since, this CEO has said the tariffs will actually help his company. Which company does he lead? A. BlackBerry B. Restoration Hardware C. Penguin Solutions D.

Time Published: 2025-04-08T15:59:32Z
Full Content:
Alongside the now live 2025 Samsung AI Vision smart TVs with Galaxy Watch gesture control, the brand has also now debuted its brand-new 2025 3D and OLED Odyssey monitors – they are now up for preorder with up to $300 in FREE credits. The brand also re-stocked all of the colors on the Galaxy S25 Ultra with straight up $200 price drops across all of them while Amazon has dropped its ultra-affordable Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet from $220 down to $158. We also spotted up to $700 in savings on TCL’s 2025 144Hz QD mini-LED smart Google TVs and the launch of the wonderful metal Arc Pulse bumper cases for Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. Samsung recently expanded its Odyssey gaming monitor lineup by announcing the launch of new 3D and OLED models last month. There are a total of three new models, all of which are now up for pre-orders directly at Samsung with FREE credits. You are looking at two 27-inch and an ultra-wide 49-inch G9 display, and the prices for these start at $999.99 shipped. Folks who took advantage of the limited-time Reserve campaign will also see a bonus $50 off on top of the $300 in savings right now until these monitors officially hit the shelves. Head below for a closer look at the monitors and more details. All three monitors, as previously mentioned are now up for pre-orders. The prices start at $999.99 shipped, and they all come with FREE credits. You’ll also see an additional $50 credit if you reserved the units as a part of the reserve campaign, though the new offers with FREE credits are still worth looking into. Today, Arc is launching its wonderful metal Arc Pulse bumper cases for the new Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphones. Up until now, the Arc’s special brand of smartphone protection has only been available on iPhone models, the latest Google Pixel 9 devices, and previous-generation Galaxy handsets, but it is finally ready to begin taking orders on the new S25 Ultra Arc Pulse Bumper Cases. Head below for more details. We came away thoroughly impressed with the latest iPhone 16 Arc Pulse bumper cases after going hands-on last fall when Apple debuted its latest. Fast forward to today, some two months after Samsung’s latest S25 lineup took the Android world by storm, and Arc is now ready to deliver its unique smartphone case to the latest Galaxy devices. Bumper cases really aren’t for everyone, but if they are for your or you’re considering dabbling in the ultra-minimalist bumper case world, the Arc Pulse lineup is easily one of the best you’ll find anywhere. Made from aerospace-grade metals with a friction-based attachment system that requires no messy adhesives, the two piece case (if you want to call it that), quickly and securely snaps onto either side of your device to provide corner and camera array protection, while also raising your device off the table top like any normal case when you rest it down. Arc Pulse is designed to enhance your phone experience while offering an exceptional blend of aesthetics and phone safeguarding. Crafted from aerospace-grade Aluminum, the smartphone case provides a delightful tactile experience while ensuring phone protection. The outer metal shell distributes the impact while a custom inner layer absorbs the shock. Enhance your phone safety and elevate your style with a statement accessory. The pre-orders offers on the latest Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra smartphones were wild, with deep discounts, enhanced trade-in offers, and some seriously notable bundle offers with the add-on gear. While these savings have long since come and gone now, Samsung has now re-stocked all colors of its flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra and is now offering a straight up $200 in savings on all of them with a trade-in requirement. Again, there were some wild deals during the pre-order phase and closer to launch, but if you missed out on those there are now some notable savings to take advantage of with all of the color options on the new S25 Ultra now back in-stock. Considering how hard it is to determine how Trump tariffs might affect both already-released gear and upcoming launches, it might be worth at least considering some of the savings up for grabs right now while you still can. While it appears Samsung hasn’t re-stocked all of the colors on the more affordable S25 and S25+ variants like it has on the S25 Ultra, there are some deals floating around right nonetheless. If you’re looking to sidestep Amazon’s budget-friendly Fire tablet in your search for an ultra-affordable tablet, Samsung’s latest Galaxy Tab A9+ should be on your radar. Regularly $220 and currently marked down to $159.99 directly from Samsung, Amazon actually has it right now for a few bucks less at $157.19 shipped. You’re looking at nearly 30% in savings and the lowest price we can find. While we did see this one drop to $150 for a very brief time for part of the recent Amazon Big Spring Sale last month, today’s deal is otherwise the best price of the year – the only deals better than these were during Black Friday and Prime Day last year. While this is clearly no flagship S10+ or S10 Ultra – the new mid-range Galaxy S10 FE models are coming soon and you can already secure a FREE $50 reserve credit towards your purchase of one (they are set to go live on April 10 and you can get all of the details right here) – the Tab A9+ can make for a notable casual tablet experience. Landing you in the Galaxy family at just over $150 shipped right now, it comes complete with an 11-inch display, a Dolby Atmos “cinema-like audio experience,” the 7,040mAh intenral battery, a “safe place to learn and play with the Samsung Kids app,” and more – all running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chip. Here’s our launch coverage for more details. The new 2025 TCL QM6K QD mini-LED smart Google TV lineup has arrived and we are now tracking even lower prices than our initial mention to deliver new Amazon all-time low pricing across various sizes. The deepest deal of the lot lands on the 85-inch model at $1,299.99 shipped. This model launched at $2,000 in early February and is now seeing a deep 35% price drop for $700 in savings off the list price. Head below for additional details and price drops on the more modest sizes. The new QM6K model sport TCL’s latest QD mini-LED panels featuring its Halo Control System – “an advanced Technology Suite that includes the New Super High Energy LED Microchip, Condensed Micro Lens, Micro OD Reduced Optical Distance, High Contrast HVA Panel, Enhanced QLED, Zero Delay Transient Response, Bi-direction 23-bit Backlight Controller, and Dynamic Light Algorithm for Stunning “Halo-Free” Images.” That’s on top of the updated Matte HVA Panel, maintaining an “ultra-high native contrast ratio of 7000;1” alongside a 144Hz native refresh rate, up to a “blistering fast 288 VRR” Game Accelerator, Auto Game Mode (ALLM), and AMD Freesync Premium Pro for your new Switch 2 or PS5 Pro. From there, you can also expect everything to run on the Google TV platform, with onboard Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2 casting, built-in Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice commands, and four HDMI inputs. As part of its spring sale, OnePlus has now upped the ante on the discount for its latest OnePlus Pad 2. You can now land one at $100 off using code SPRING25 at checkout, while also claiming a FREE official Stylo add-on regularly worth $100. Alongside the free shipping here, you’re looking at a total of $200 in savings and a deal on par (in terms of value) with our previous mention – this is $650 worth of gear for $449.99 shipped. Details below. As per usual, all you’ll need to do is navigate to the listing page, and then scroll down to the “Free Gift” section to claim your freebie. You can choose between the regularly $100 OnePlus Stylo stylus or the regularly $40 OnePlus Folio Case 2. And then just add everything to your cart by hitting the “Buy Now” button and apply code SPRING25 at checkout. While our previous mention on this tablet came with a FREE $150 keyboard case, the straight cash deal on the tablet itself wasn’t quite as good ($50 off instead of the $100 off we have today). Depending how much you value the various freebie add-ons here, you’re looking at roughly the same value on both options and one of the best deals we have tracked. This is the latest OnePlus tablet, complete with a CNC aluminum unibody frame and a 12.1-inch 3K LCD display powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of RAM. Everything else you need to know awaits right here and you’ll find the latest from OnePlus below: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. Check out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:

Title: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta follow Nvidia in Magnificent 7 stock rally
URL: https://qz.com/tesla-microsoft-meta-nvidia-big-tech-rally-tariffs-1851775247
Time Published: 2025-04-08T15:59:00Z
Full Content:
The trade-war selloff took a breather earlier on Tuesday, buoying Big Tech firms including Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%), Tesla (TSLA-0.96%), Meta (META-0.59%), and Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%), after a mixed day on Monday and two especially gnarly days last week wiped $1.8 trillion off the market value of leading tech stocks. The moment’s shifting investor outlook seemed wrapped up in hopes that deals will soon emerge from President Donald Trump’s tariff talks; investors chased that glimmer of light by boosting Nvidia stock by more than 5% earlier in the day. Nvidia then shed most of those gains; it was up 1.4% at around 2:40 p.m. Eastern, while Tesla was down roughly 2%, Microsoft and Meta were mostly flat, Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) was down 0.8%, and Apple (AAPL+4.00%) was down 3.2%. Regarding the president’s as-of-yet unrealized tariff deals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that he thinks investors will “see a couple of big trading partners do deals very quickly.” Just yesterday, Big Tech’s recent losses had the stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL+2.68%) approaching one-year lows. Apple, which relies on factories in China to build its iPhones, is among the tech giants most vulnerable to sweeping tariffs. A temporary workaround for the Cupertino firm may include sending more of its India-built iPhones to the U.S. market to dodge the worst of the president’s tariffs. Temporarily exempt chipmakers and advertising giants (think: Nvidia and Meta) may fare better than hardware-focused companies such as Apple, but no tech giant is invulnerable to the fallout. Tariffs could take a bite out of the corporate ad budgets that firms like Meta subsist on, while tariffs-induced price hikes could slow gadget sales and ultimately hit chipmakers’ bottom lines.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Too Cheap?

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why would an investor pay 30 times earnings for Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) when Nvidia stock is trading at 33 times earnings? It wouldn't make much sense, especially when considering these three key points: Some might consider Nvidia a “safe haven,” but its track record during market downturns tells a different story. For example, Nvidia stock dropped more than 65% during the 2022 inflation crisis. In 2020, amid pandemic uncertainty, the stock fell over 35%. Most significantly, during the 2008–2009 financial meltdown, Nvidia shares plummeted by 85%. Clearly, NVDA isn't a safe stock. For more detail, see our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? along with analysis of previous market crashes. That said, Nvidia’s stock has already seen a considerable correction, falling from nearly $150 at the start of the year to below $100. For investors looking for a potentially steadier, high-performing approach, the Trefis High Quality portfoliomay be worth considering. This strategy has delivered over 75% returns since inception, as shown in its HQ performance metrics. If you believe in the continued rise and expansion of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be an attractive long-term play at current valuation levels. Nvidia essentially serves as an “arms supplier” in the AI arena. Investing in Nvidia is not a bet on any one player like OpenAI, Google, or Amazon, but rather on the backbone that supports them all. The AI race is still developing, and companies are pouring in resources. For example, Google’s infrastructure-related capital expenditure is approximately $75 billion, showing the scale of the investment. Despite the optimism, Nvidia does face risks. Earnings could fall short of expectations, or growth might slow from 50% to around 30% as businesses tighten spending. Additionally, clients might pursue more efficient AI models, lessening the need for Nvidia’s chips. Unpredictable events could also negatively impact the stock. These factors suggest that downside risk—as much as 40%—is possible. Selling during such dips could hurt investors more than holding through volatility. Nonetheless, for long-term investors with a 3-5 year outlook who can tolerate swings, Nvidia at today’s levels may be a compelling entry into the AI revolution. Those interested in navigating downturns or potentially gaining from them might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has beaten its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices). Consulting with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets may also be wise. Remember, many fortunes are built by those who stay calm and strategic in volatile markets.

After taking a beating for the past week, chip stocks climbed Tuesday morning as part of a broader market rally. Nvidia (NVDA+2.52%) shares had lost almost 15% over the previous three trading sessions but had clawed back 8% by midday Tuesday before retreating slightly. Meanwhile, other leading chip makers, including Broadcom (AVGO+4.99%), Intel (INTC-1.85%), Micron Technology (MU-0.31%), Lam Research (LRCX+1.70%), Applied Materials (AMAT+5.12%), Samsung, and Cisco (CSCO+1.71%) were also up Tuesday. Nvidia’s slide accelerated last week after HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded the stock from a “buy” to a “hold,” noting that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Meanwhile, other chip stocks were getting better reviews from analysts. For instance, GuruFocus research shows that Broadcom has received a “Strong Buy” rating from nearly 88% of brokerage analysts. Trump’s trade war had sunk chip stocks as fears over slowing demand and high prices took hold. However, semiconductors are exempt from new tariff rates imposed on a slate of countries, which should insulate chip makers from some tariff turmoil. Also of concern: Data centers planned by major IT companies have been delayed or shelved as uncertainty surrounding ROI increases. Microsoft (MSFT+1.86%) announced yesterday that it has abandoned its $1 billion data center project in Licking County, Ohio, citing a strategic investment review.

Title: Wall Street surges back but global picture remains fragile
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2025/04/08/wall-street-surges-back-but-global-picture-remains-fragile/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T14:43:03Z

Wall Street’s main indexes have bounced back from a heavy selloff, led by technology stocks, on hopes of the US opening up for negotiations on its aggressive tariffs. Most megacap and growth stocks gained, with Nvidia and Meta Platforms adding 5 per cent each and Tesla rising 4 per cent. The technology sector rose 3.5 per cent, while indexes tracking banks and semiconductor stocks were up 4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively. The CBOE Volatility index – seen as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ – retreated to 38.59 points after rising on Monday to its highest level since August last year. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was trading 2.5 per cent higher after three sessions of heavy losses. “While today’s market bounce offers some relief, trade tensions remain the elephant in the room,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM. “With Trump threatening a further 50 per cent tariff on China and Beijing refusing to back down, sentiment could turn quickly.” At 9.35am eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.11 per cent; the S&P 500 gained 3.16 per cent; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.65 per cent. [ China vows to ‘fight to the end’ in tariff war with USOpens in new window ] Since the reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd, concerns over a global trade war and fears of a recession in the US have gripped Wall Street, with the three major indexes hitting around one-year lows. The Nasdaq confirmed a bear market on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow are down more than 15 per cent from their record-high closes. Uncertainty lingered after China said it will never accept the “blackmail nature” of the US to Trump’s threat to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview to CNBC on Tuesday tariff negotiations are the result of calls from other countries, not sliding financial markets, and China’s escalation is a big mistake. Meanwhile, Trump said he discussed tariffs, among others, in a “great” call with acting South Korean President Han Duck-soo. Worries that the aggressive US tariffs could spur inflation and hamper global growth have led to greater pricing of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Traders see more than 96 basis points of easing by the December, implying three fully priced in 25-bps cuts and a 84 per cent chance of a fourth such a reduction, according to LSEG data. A consumer price inflation reading is also due on Thursday, which could offer more clues on the inflation trajectory. Among individual stocks, chipmaker Broadcom advanced 7.4 per cent after the company said it was launching a new share buyback program of up to $10 billion. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group gained 7.6 per cent after the US announced 5.06 per cent increase in payment rates to private insurers for 2026 Medicare Advantage health plans. Humana soared 11.7 per cent, while Elevance Health also gained 6.5 per cent. CVS Health jumped 8.4 per cent. The insurer named UPS executive Brian Newman as its chief financial officer. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13.36-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 6.33-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded nine new highs and 24 new lows. Earlier, Asia stocks bounced off 1½ year lows, while European shares opened broadly higher. The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 1.4 per cent after falling for four consecutive sessions. The domestically focused midcap index also gained 2.5 per cent, after hitting its lowest point since November 2023 in the previous session. Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei stock index closed 6 per cent higher, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tasked with leading trade negotiations with Tokyo. – Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Big rebound in US stocks meets scepticism
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2998621/big-rebound-in-us-stocks-meets-scepticism
Time Published: 2025-04-08T14:21:00Z

NEW YORK - US stocks soared early on Tuesday after the biggest three-day rout in five years, fuelled by the most oversold conditions since the depths of the pandemic and optimism the Trump administration will water down its harsh tariff regime. The S&P 500 Index was up 3.34% as of 9.30am in New York, heading for its best day since November 2022. The cash index shed more than $5 trillion in three days, with Monday’s lows taking it more than 20% from its latest record. Rumours of a possible tariff delay sparked a massive rebound before the index found support at 5,000. Treasuries also reversed a rally, with the 10-year yield pushing back above 4%. “It’s a normal reflexive bounce you tend to see after plunging into oversold territory so quickly,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. “We’re in an environment of extreme volatility, and that counts both the downside and upside.” The Cboe Volatility Index soared past 50 Monday and was still near 40 early Tuesday, well above its long-term average. More than 29 billion shares exchanged hands in yesterday’s wild ride. While stocks looked set to recover some Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index still remains 15% off its Feb. 19 peak. The 14-day relative strength index sank to 23 Monday — its lowest since 2020 and well below levels that historically suggest the S&P 500 is ripe for a bounce. Tuesday’s relief rally has forced big-money speculators to unwind bearish bets in droves as oversold stocks recovered, leaving many scrambling to unwind short positions, according hedge-fund manager Jim Roppel, founder of Roppel Capital Management. “This rebound feels very much like a telltale sign of a short squeeze,” Roppel said by phone. “But things are so brutally oversold it makes perfect sense for stocks to rally.” Adding to optimism Tuesday were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said there is the potential for advantageous trade deals with major US trading partners. “I’ve seen the call list at the White House, and it’s substantial — we were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritise,” Bessent said on CNBC Tuesday. “You are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly.” China, however, was not among them, with Beijing saying late Monday it is prepared to “fight to the end”. Japan looks set to get priority in talks to roll back President Donald Trump’s duties, which are scheduled to kick in at 12.01am Wednesday Washington time. “The market is set up for a relief rally, while the ex-China headlines point to negotiations with Japan driving markets more than the retaliation risks with China and the European Union,” said Andrew Tyler, head of global market intelligence at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The chances of the stock market staging a tactical rebound have increased after the recent selloff, according to JPMorgan Chase trategists. Market technicians are monitoring The Arms Index, also called TRIN, an indicator that tracks the relationship between the number of stocks increasing or decreasing in price and the volume associated with those stocks. Readings below 0.5 suggest more demand for stocks and dictates how oversold the market is, while readings above 2.0 are a sign that investors are dumping equities and that stocks are overbought. On Monday, the index fell to 0.47, helping drive a short-term bounce for equities. After hedge funds sold global stocks last Thursday by the most since the first half of 2020, the group, along with long-only funds, were both net buyers Monday at $1.5 billion — the highest buy skew for hedge funds since January, according to Goldman Sachs. That comes after bets against the world’s largest exchange-traded fund — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) — climbed to the highest since December on Monday.

Title: Rushes Extra | The Battle of the Alamo

Time Published: 2025-04-08T14:11:02Z

Rushes Extra goes beyond the headlines to take a closer look at developing stories from throughout the film world. Photographs by Eleanor Petry. On the afternoon of March 7, a cold and blustery Friday in New York, about twenty people march in a neat ellipse on the sidewalk outside the Lower Manhattan location of Alamo Drafthouse, the American dine-in cinema chain. As more Alamo workers arrive to join the picket, they take signs from a nearby handcart, most of them handwritten on cardboard or on the back of all-purpose placards printed by United Auto Workers, the union with which Alamo United has been affiliated since the fall of 2023. References to movies occasionally appear: “‘I can do this all day.’ –Captain America,” “Sony make Alamo Do the Right Thing,” “Sony thought I was mad about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sequels.” Just blocks from the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, chants echo off of the limestone edifices of capital. “Exploitation ain’t the way / Alamo workers need fair pay!” “Sony corporate, you can’t hide / You committed labor crimes!”; “Who runs the Alamo? / We run the Alamo!” On January 14, Alamo Drafthouse announced mass layoffs across the company, letting go of nine percent of its corporate staff (fifteen employees of 165) as well as an unspecified number of part-time hourly employees at its 42 venues on a last-in, first-out basis. At its Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn locations alone, 70 people were laid off. One month later, Alamo workers at the Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan locations went on strike to protest the layoffs. They are asking would-be cinemagoers to refrain from attending screenings at Alamo during the strike, and for Alamo members to cancel their subscriptions. (When contacted about this piece, Alamo management declined to comment.) As the numbers on the sidewalk swell, Anthony Squitire—a server and trainer at the Brooklyn Alamo Drafthouse for three and a half years, and a member of the NYC Alamo United bargaining committee—delivers a speech, reading off handwritten loose sheafs of yellow legal-pad paper. “Everyone suffers under the pursuit of unattainable profit margins,” he hollers. “There are only two things in this world that seek to grow exponentially to selfish and lethal ends: capitalism and cancer.” Squitire goes on to condemn the Alamo management representatives who insist their workers’ demands for health and safety protections, formalized disciplinary procedures, and increased pay on holidays are unrealistic while Sony Pictures executives “pop champagne with celebrities in our hallways, spend $10K on gifts for Oscar nominees, and make hundreds of billions off the PlayStation 5 alone.” He specifically identifies Kelley Bondelie, VP of Operations at Alamo, and Jennifer Yarbrough, Chief People Officer, claiming that they log on to Zoom bargaining sessions with “sweaters wrapped around their necks” and “twenty-foot in-ground pools” in the background. “Today marks three weeks of our strike,” Squitire concludes. “We are stronger than ever, and we will fight until the bitter end.” Founded in Austin, Texas, in 1997 by Tim and Karrie League as a one-screen second-run theater, Alamo Drafthouse quickly made a name for itself as an independently-operated cinema dedicated to elevating the theatrical experience with food-and-drink service (including alcohol) and well-curated programming. The theater garnered early notices from hometown filmmaking heroes like Richard Linklater and Robert Rodriguez; in 1999, Quentin Tarantino moved his then-annual QT Fest, at which he screened selections from his personal print collection, from the Dobie Theatre to the Alamo. With its kooky preshow attractions, special celebrity guest appearances, and strictly enforced “no talking” policy, Alamo generated a cult-like reputation as a place run by and for contemporary film enthusiasts. By 2010, Alamo had begun to expand beyond Texas as part of a national dine-in cinema boom. Since the mid-to-late aughts, competing chains had been taking up its business model, offering premium concessions to mitigate flagging theater attendance. Today, major theater chains like AMC and Regal Cinemas offer full bar service, multiple dine-in theaters have sprung up around the country, and Alamo operates 42 locations in ten states and Washington, D.C., with plans to expand further. When the COVID-19 lockdowns began in March 2020, Alamo closed most of its locations and furloughed about 80 percent of its theater employees; four months later, it laid off more than 80 corporate employees. In March 2021, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it failed to service approximately $105 million in debt. A couple months later, Alamo emerged from bankruptcy with Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group as its new owners. In August 2020, the Department of Justice lifted the Paramount Consent Decrees, which had prevented film distributors from owning and controlling exhibition companies since 1948. “Because changes in antitrust law and administration have diminished the importance of the Decrees’ restrictions, while still providing protections that will keep the probability of future violations low, the Court finds that termination of the Decrees is in the public interest,” wrote US District Judge Analisa Torres in her decision. In June 2024, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired Alamo, making it the first Hollywood studio to own a theater chain in over 75 years. Mass deregulation and weakened antitrust laws paved the way for American cinema to become even more consolidated and monopolized than it was before. Michael Kustermann, the current CEO of Alamo Drafthouse, is also the head of “Sony Pictures Experiences.” In recent years, several New York City cinemas have unionized as a way to bargain for higher wages and more equitable workplace policies. In 2019, BAM administrative workers and cinema staff at the Brooklyn Academy of Music voted to unionize. Anthology Film Archives employees went on a one-day strike on March 31, 2022, and voted to ratify their first contract two and a half months later. Film Forum workers voted unanimously in favor of unionization in June 2022 and ratified their first contract one year later. On July 21, 2023, the summer’s most hotly anticipated films, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (both 2023), opened on the same day and made a combined $300 million. Their success was manna from heaven for a Hollywood still feeling the effects of the pandemic slump and its own labor strikes, but the opening weekend placed a heavy strain on theater employees nationwide, including and especially those working at Alamo Drafthouse, who are tasked with preparing and serving food and drinks on-demand throughout the shows, in addition to the usual responsibilities of an usher. It was after the infamous “Barbenheimer weekend” that workers at the Brooklyn and Manhattan Alamo Drafthouses began to collectively organize. Though League stepped down as Alamo’s CEO to become chairman of the board in May 2020, he endures as a brand mascot for the company and a leading industry figure, having gone on to cofound Neon, an Oscar-winning production and distribution company. Alamo management brought him in to encourage workers at the Brooklyn Alamo not to unionize in the fall of 2023. During a meeting, an audio recording of which was obtained by the Associated Press, League insisted that a union would drive a wedge between staff and management while proclaiming his progressive bona fides, like supporting Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential run. “I built this company to be the best damn cinema that has ever, or will ever, exist,” he told workers. “I personally feel strongly that inserting a union between you and me and the team hinders that goal.” Within days, on September 29, the Brooklyn Alamo voted to unionize. Two weeks later, on October 12, the Lower Manhattan Alamo did the same. Both cited a toxic culture of understaffing and exhaustion that was not being effectively addressed by management. “The whole point of a contract was for some modicum of consistency,” Squitire told Notebook over the phone in February. “It can't be that some days are easy, and some days I'm pulling my hair out in the walk-in and smoking six cigarettes because I'm on the verge of a panic attack. Unionizing was a matter of legally forcing corporate to listen to us when we tell them what they need for the business not to go under.” In the United States, businesses are legally required to negotiate layoffs with unions in the midst of contract bargaining, so they did not go into effect immediately at the company’s three unionized locations. In Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, NYC Alamo United is associated with UAW Local 2179; in Denver, Colorado, Alamo Collective joined Communication Workers of America (CWA) Local 7777. On January 31, after multiple negotiation sessions, when dozens of articles of contention were reportedly still on the table, management unilaterally declared an impasse on the layoffs issue. In response, the union filed an Unfair Labor Practice complaint to the National Labor Relations Board on February 3, the same day roughly twenty percent of the New York City workforce was laid off. NYC Alamo United had discussed the possibility of a strike if layoffs were imposed and had voted to approve one on January 30, the day before the impasse. Following a week of informational pickets, 175 New York workers agreed to walk out on February 14, the same day that 60 workers at the Sloans Lake location in Denver did. The holiday is typically a busy day for Alamo; this year it was also the beginning of a crucial opening weekend for Captain America: Brave New World and Paddington in Peru (both 2025). Conor Hall, who has worked as a server at the Brooklyn Alamo for three years, gave a passionate speech in the kitchen prior to the walkout that effectively rallied the troops. Gesturing wildly to his peers, he exclaims, “All of [you] wonderful people make this the number one Alamo in the country. This is how we remind corporate that it's not because of movies and popcorn. It's because of the people.” “All I had to do was recognize how I was feeling and how I was seeing my coworkers treated,” Hall told Notebook. “So all I could say was the truth, which is that the only way to send a message these days is as a unified voice. No one person can be heard in the din and clamor of corporate America, but if enough people come together and speak loudly enough, it's impossible to drown them out.” In Manhattan, the picketers, now about 45 strong and tailed by four relaxed police officers, wind their way noisily north, rounding the corner of City Hall Park at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge. Several unionists field questions from passersby and distribute leaflets about the layoffs featuring a menacing cartoon popcorn bucket holding kernels in either hand as though they might be bricks. When a Downtown Alliance pickup truck pulls up in the midst of its garbage-collection rounds, unionists hand leaflets to the curious men through the open window. As on the cinema floor, a division of labor takes root, though in this case it is self-selected. Someone leads the chants. Someone distributes snacks from a large backpack. Someone pushes the cart in which signs have been replaced with backpacks and water bottles. (Others help them to get its rickety wheels over every curb cut.) Bringing up the rear, one unionist wheels a piece of carry-on luggage with a neck pillow strung around the handle; he must proceed directly to the airport after the march, heading home for a funeral. Rosa Martinez, who has worked as a food runner at the Brooklyn Alamo for two years, told Notebook that most of their coworkers are also film workers of one kind or another. (In fact, they are taking advantage of the strike to work on the set of another worker’s film that weekend.) It’s no surprise that cinema workers would have creative passions beyond theater operations, but Martinez’s comment is a reminder of how the struggles at Alamo are intertwined with those of a larger industry in crisis. We’re still experiencing the longtail effects of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which exacerbated concerns around the future of theatrical exhibition and human labor in Hollywood. Ariana Fatalia, a bartender who works both in front and back of house at the Brooklyn Alamo, was laid off and has been striking alongside her former colleagues since Valentine’s Day. She had been going to school for computer science at the City College of New York and informed venue management about her relatively limited availability during the winter months. Just as winter classes ended and her availability opened up, she learned she was on the list for layoffs. “Funny story about me, the place I worked for like five years was Amazon Whole Foods,” she told Notebook. “They wrongfully fired me, and I joined Alamo because I thought, It’s unionized, and this will never happen to me again. This will be the part-time job that will get me through college.” Ariana believes that the old Alamo would have only reduced people’s hours instead of resorting to layoffs, but that the Sony buyout changed the mandate. “Flexible scheduling was a big part of Alamo, and now everything’s completely changed,” she says. “This is all Alamo Drafthouse under Sony.” Jordan Baruch—a bargaining committee member and concierge shift lead who has worked at the Brooklyn Alamo since November 2022—insists that “one of the very significant things that is different about this year compared to the past years when Alamo didn’t lay anybody off in this quarter is that Sony now owns Alamo. I don't really see how that’s not a big part of the equation.” In previous years, Alamo would regularly reduce hours depending on seasonal market shifts, as film exhibitors expect to have busier and slower months. The company alleged low first-quarter projections as a reason for layoffs, rather than the usual reduction in hours. According to information shared with Notebook, Alamo has cut back on screenings and food service in response to the strike. Between spring and summer 2024, Alamo added five new screens to the Brooklyn location. It and the Lower Manhattan location are the chain’s two most profitable locations, according to internal ticket admission numbers. Currently, the Brooklyn Alamo is operating only seven of its twelve theaters due to the strike. For the first week and a half, showtimes were marked “sold out” on the app when they reached roughly 50 percent capacity. As the sun wanes on the afternoon of March 7, the picket passes Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street encampment. It passes the Bowling Green Bull, where tourists turn their phones and cameras to the march, a mixture of impassivity and confusion playing across their faces. The unionists weave through sculptural roadblocks and come to a stop in front of the Trump Building, which was built in 1930 to house the earliest progenitor of JPMorgan Chase, the largest American bank; the lease was sold to Donald Trump’s company in 1995. “We’re going in,” someone murmurs, but they do not. Instead, Brooks Cline—member of the bargaining committee and guest attendant shift lead at the Lower Manhattan Alamo for three and a half years—unfolds another sheaf of yellow legal pad paper. He denounces Alamo management for the layoffs and their “inhumanity and disregard for working-class people” before putting their struggle into context with the rising tides of reactionism: Cline concludes his speech by reiterating that the unionists are out in the streets for all the people whom Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Elon Musk have declared a war against. “We are marching out here for workers everywhere—workers of color, trans workers, migrant workers, workers of all circumstances chronically stymied by the hammer of capitalism. We are marching because we are united against corporate greed in all its forms.” As he tucks his paper back into his pocket, the chants resume: “No Trump, no KKK / No fascist USA.” NYC Alamo United has been on strike for nearly two months. Meanwhile, the parallel strike in Denver ended after just four days. According to Josh Reitze—a member of the CWA bargaining committee who has worked in the kitchen at the Sloans Lake Alamo since 2022—their union had always planned on a brief walkout, a strategy they shared with New York ahead of time. “We did not intend to stay out indefinitely,” he says. “This is our first strike. Not everybody is able to strike for the same amount of time; not everybody has the same level of agitation to sustain a strike for as long as New York has. I commend them wholeheartedly for keeping their strike going, but we wanted something more targeted for our first big action.” Reitze believes their strike was a success in terms of “organizational maturity,” as he has witnessed a rise in participation and engagement within the shop, though it remains to be seen whether any gains will be reflected in future bargaining sessions. Reitze received assurances from management that the laid-off Sloans Lake workers will be offered their jobs back, but that has yet to materialize and he admits that general progress in contract negotiations has slowed to a crawl. In New York, Baruch has been in the bargaining sessions since contract negotiations began in January 2024, and he says that management has been dismissive of union proposals from the start. “We've been through three different [management] law firms over the course of this union fight,” he says. “They've been using Ogletree Deakins now for the longest, and their playbook is to decline or reject proposals that mean a lot to the contract and not give a reason why or just to shrug. The workers themselves will tell them what it takes to adequately staff our locations with long speeches that are very from the heart. They just ignore what we say and essentially put their heads face down on the table.” Two bargaining sessions have taken place since the strike began. Baruch believes the March 3 session was particularly productive in terms of contract negotiation and working toward reinstatement of the terminated workers. Despite high hopes after the demonstration, the union was disappointed by the tenor of the subsequent session on March 10, three days later. As the strike nears the end of its second month, with workers on the picket line most days of the week, the unionists are keenly aware of how important maintaining morale and momentum will be in the days ahead. Baruch invokes a few recent positive developments: a food drive secured donations for striking workers, and a public screening of Brett Story and Stephen Maing’s Union (2024), which documents the Amazon Labor Union’s efforts to unionize a Staten Island warehouse, doubled as a successful fundraiser for Alamo United. He also mentions that some strikers have started to receive unemployment insurance. With that money in addition to the strike assistance fund, some people might end up making more money on strike than they would working at Alamo two or three shifts a week due to the slow season. “That's not why we did it,” Baruch insists, “but it’s part of the calculus of how people are still thinking about the strike and their personal decisions about whether or not they want to continue or advocate for us to end prematurely.” Fatalia, the bartender and computer-science student, says that she’s made everlasting bonds with the people on the picket line, and that whether or not she gets her job back, she’s willing to fight “to get rid of Sony's corporate greed.” Squitire believes that they’ve shown Alamo that they will “not accept them flagrantly breaking federal labor law” and they “we will make them hurt if they try to make us hurt.” The next bargaining session is scheduled for April 11. Alamo management and the unionized workers remain functionally deadlocked, the former evidently hoping to sweat out the strike while the latter builds public support and discusses potential escalation. Meanwhile, union fervor has spread to other Alamo locations across the country. On March 25, the Slaughter Lane Alamo in Austin, Texas, the company’s hometown, delivered their demand for recognition with UAW to management. They also cited the layoffs as a reason for unionization. Regardless of what happens in the future, Conor Hall believes that they’ve made an impact on the public and the company: “What I know is that we stood together and we made it known that it was unfair, it was cruel, and if nothing else, we show that we can do this. If nothing else, we fucking did it, dude. That's the message.” Additional reporting by Maxwell Paparella. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.

Good morning. Boomers told BI they are preparing for the worst as they worry about what cuts to the Social Security Administration could mean for their benefits and access to resources. "All I can do is cross my fingers and hope," one said. In today's big story, the markets briefly entered bear-market territory on Monday — a day that saw "fake news" trigger a $4 trillion swing in a matter of minutes. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was asked if he thinks a recession is coming. His response: We're in it. Tech: The market for face computers still isn't there — and could actually shrink this year. Business: One US sector could suffer big-time from Trump's punitive tariffs on Canada. But first, a near-miss for the markets. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A $4 trillion swing. An entry into bear-market territory. A new tariff threat. Yesterday was a wild day for Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell as much as 4.7% into the bear-market zone before briefly spiking on a tariff-suspension report the White House called "fake news." Roughly $4 trillion in market value was added to the index in 34 minutes because of the report. Then the "fake news" designation sent the market back down. The move demonstrated just how desperate investors were for relief from a relentless three-day stock rout. The S&P 500 ended the day above bear-market territory, but markets aren't out of the woods yet. The US and China could be heading for a long standoff in their trade war, risking collateral damage for economies and markets the world over, BI's Huileng Tan writes. On Monday, Trump hit China with a fresh threat of an additional 50% in tariffs — on top of a total 54% he announced since taking office — if Beijing doesn't withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it announced on Friday. Today, things intensified further. China's Commerce Ministry called Trump's latest threat "a mistake on top of a mistake." "If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end," said a ministry spokesperson. 1. Billionaires are turning on Trump over tariffs. The ultrawealthy were bullish on Trump around election season, but now they're souring on him after seeing trillions wiped from the stock market. They've seen their net worths plummet during the sell-off — and they've had enough. 2. Larry Fink says the recession might already be here. The BlackRock commander-in-chief said most CEOs in his orbit agree that we're "probably in a recession right now." But he doesn't think you should sell your stocks just yet. 3. Tesla's latest plunge has proved Trump's commerce secretary wrong. Last month, Howard Lutnick said a $235 share price was the lowest Tesla would ever go and that they'd "never be this cheap again." Shares on Monday dropped as low as $214. 1. The face-tech market just ain't happening. Big Tech companies like Apple and Meta keep betting on face computers like AR and VR goggles, even though customers don't seem to be interested. This year, the market for face tech might even shrink — but Meta's still optimistic. 2. A logistics giant is turning its warehouses into robot testing labs. GXO is betting big on the next frontier of physical AI, putting humanoid robots from three different firms to work in its warehouses. GXO's chief automation officer said the tech could theoretically complete multiple tasks in the future. 3. Trump tariffs are all about Taiwan. Tariffs are Trump's attempt to shift the global economy away from Chinese manufacturing. That's because Taiwan, home to TSMC, is at the heart of global supply chains. If China invades Taiwan, the economic shock could make last week look tame. 1. The next big loser in Trump's beef with Canada. Canadian investors have put some $184 billion in US commercial real estate over the last decade. Some are wealthy pension funds such as Oxford Properties Group, a partner in Hudson Yards. Trump's punitive tariffs are endangering the pipeline of steady Canadian cash to those projects. 2. The Okta CEO's hot take on the job market for software engineers. Even as AI shakes up the field, Todd McKinnon expects more demand for software engineers in the next five years, not less. Here's why. 3. DOGE's targets in its consultancy crackdown. From DEI to energy-related contracts, BI analyzed five government contracts DOGE has axed. It shows a major realignment in how the federal government is working with consultants.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The millions of people who rely on medical devices like hearing aids or insulin pumps could face higher prices due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Unlike pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers did not get a carveout from the levies. Some 40% of all devices are manufactured overseas, including in Mexico and Europe, which now face tariff rates of 25% and 20%, respectively. Even devices manufactured in the U.S. may require imported parts, which could be subject to tariffs. The CEO of one health system based near Seattle told Forbes its costs could go up $10 million to $25 million a year due to tariffs. “The healthcare supply chain is fragile,” says Erik Wexler, CEO of Providence. Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Stock markets experienced tariff whiplash Monday, ending the day mostly down after a whirlwind trading session. All three indexes fell dramatically at opening, but then reversed course after an unsubstantiated claim circulated on social media saying the White House would pause the tariffs for 90 days before the Trump Administration called it “fake news.” Bitcoin’s post-election gains were briefly erased Monday, as the token is one of several that has declined in value in recent days after Trump’s tariff announcement. The tariffs have wiped about $290 billion from the global crypto market’s aggregate capitalization since April 2, despite Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. The tariff saga continues, as Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China, and the European Union is reportedly considering a 25% import tax on some U.S. goods. The White House already imposed one of the harshest levies on China, at 34%, on top of a 20% tariff imposed earlier this year, meaning the tax would climb to 104% under Trump’s latest threat. Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images Denise Prenosil, the ex-wife of Dick’s Sporting Goods Chairman Ed Stack, is now one of the richest women in America, thanks to the company’s incredible post-pandemic run. Prenosil is worth an estimated $1 billion as shares of the sporting goods chain soared more than 850% over the past five years. The U.S. lags when it comes to privately financed infrastructure, but Michael Dorrell, CEO of infrastructure investment firm Stonepeak, has turned the market into a bonanza. Stonepeak manages a $72 billion infrastructure portfolio that includes wind farms, broadband service and fiber providers, and Forbes estimates Dorrell is now worth $8.5 billion. Photo by Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to block a district court judge’s order barring the Trump Administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, but said that from now on, detainees under the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice that they are subject to removal and be given “a reasonable time” to challenge their deportation in the proper venue. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies threaten his gains from his social media venture: After announcing the plans last week, Trump’s stake in the parent company of Truth Social plummeted about $260 million to $1.9 billion. But Trump is still ahead, since he invested no money in the business at the outset, and it has a super-high valuation relative to its underlying financials. If you’ve looked at your retirement or brokerage account the last few days, it probably hurt. But the losses you’re seeing don’t translate for tax purposes unless you sold investments. To figure out the realized gain or loss, subtract the basis (how much you paid for an asset) from the sale price. ID Logistics French logistics company ID Logistics took a hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week, and its billionaire founder and CEO Eric Hémar lost $200 million. It’s no surprise given that ID is caught in the middle of the international showdown. ID—which manages the flow of goods in and out of warehouses for companies like Amazon and Inditex, packaging items before they’re shipped to consumers—is the leading logistics company in France, and also has a presence in 18 other countries. Approximately 70% of its $3.6 billion in revenue comes from outside of France, with the greatest share from Poland, followed by the U.S., then Spain and Portugal. But Hémar doesn’t appear to be rattled. When asked about the tariffs, he responded calmly. “My business is domestic,” he said, “Where I am directly concerned is that my business is sensitive to the economic climate.” But one analyst told Forbes that an economic downturn could encourage companies to outsource more of their logistics and drive more business to ID. The contract logistics industry barely existed a few decades ago, when most companies handled their own packaging and shipping. Now businesses are increasingly realizing they can save money by outsourcing those tasks. The industry is set to keep growing: BNP Paribas estimates that the contract logistics market in the U.S. is only 20% built out; the most mature market is the U.K., at just 60%. WHY IT MATTERS “Plenty of companies are already experiencing losses from Trump’s tariff war—but on the other side of this economic turmoil, there will also be some winners,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “One could be the French entrepreneur Eric Hémar, along with his company ID Logistics. His industry is set to expand if retailers, eager to find new ways to cut costs, start outsourcing more of their logistics.” MORE Despite Share Slide, Jeff Bezos And Amazon Look Likely To End Up Tariff Winners Analysts see turbulence ahead for the airline industry as tariffs weigh on consumer confidence.

Title: The Relentless Rise of Jensen Huang

How Jensen Huang built Nvidia into a nearly $3 trillion business Listen to more stories on hark Another day, another new AI large language model that’s supposedly better than all previous ones. When I began writing this story, Elon Musk’s xAI had just released Grok 3, which the company says performs better than its competitors against a wide range of benchmarks. As I was revising the article, Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which it says outperforms Grok 3. And by the time you read this, who knows? Maybe an entirely new LLM will have appeared. In January, after all, the AI world was temporarily rocked by the release of a low-cost, high-performance LLM from China called DeepSeek-R1. A month later, people were already wondering when DeepSeek-R2 would come out. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. The competition among LLMs may be hard to keep track of, but for Nvidia, the company that designs the computer chips—or graphics-processing units (GPUs)—that many of these large language models have been trained on, it’s also enormously lucrative. Nvidia, which, as of this writing, is the third-most-valuable company in the world (after Apple and Microsoft), was started three decades ago by engineers who wanted to make graphics cards for gamers. How it evolved into the company that is providing almost all the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush is the story at the core of Stephen Witt’s The Thinking Machine. Framed as a biography of Jensen Huang, the only CEO Nvidia has ever had, the book is also something more interesting and revealing: a window onto the intellectual, cultural, and economic ecosystem that has led to the emergence of superpowerful AI. James Surowiecki: DeepSeek’s chatbot has an important message That ecosystem’s center, of course, is Silicon Valley, where Huang has spent most of his adult life. He was born in Taiwan, the son of a chemical engineer and a teacher. The family moved to Thailand when he was 5, and a few years later, his parents sent him and his older brother to the United States to escape political unrest. Eventually, his parents relocated to the U.S. as well, and Huang grew up in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. In the early 1980s, after majoring in electrical engineering at Oregon State (which at the time didn’t offer a computer-science major), he got a job at Advanced Micro Devices. The company—then the poor cousin of the chip giant Intel—was headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, near US 101, the highway that runs from San Jose to Stanford. Since then, Huang’s career has unfolded within a five-mile radius of that office. Huang soon left AMD for a firm called LSI Logic Corporation, which built software-design tools for chip architects, and then left LSI in 1993 to start Nvidia with the chip designers Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky: He was right on target “to run something by the age of thirty,” as he’d told them he aimed to do. The company was entering a crowded marketplace for developing graphics cards, the computer hardware that’s used to render images and videos. Nvidia didn’t have a real business plan, but Huang’s boss at LSI recommended him to Sequoia Capital. One of the Valley’s most important venture-capital firms, Sequoia helped the company get off the ground. The graphics-card business was built on a perpetual upgrade cycle that forced developers into a never-ending game of performance improvement: A company was only as good as its last card. At various points in those early years, Nvidia was one misstep away from bankruptcy, and its unofficial motto became “Our company is thirty days from going out of business.” One gets the impression that Huang liked it that way. He says his heart rate goes down under pressure, and to call him a relentless worker is to understate matters. “I should make sure that I’m sufficiently exhausted from working that no one can keep me up at night,” he once said. His reading diet features business books (which he devours). He has no obvious politics (or at least never discusses them). He’s not a gaudy philanthropist. Though devoted to his family, he’s also honest: “Lori,” he says of his wife, “did ninety percent of the parenting” of their two children. For the past 30 years, his life has clearly revolved around Nvidia. Huang’s reluctance to talk about himself makes him a challenging subject for Witt to bring to life. But Nvidia’s employees, who almost all refer to Huang by his first name, are effusive. They “worship him—I believe they would follow him out of the window of a skyscraper if he saw a market opportunity there,” Witt writes. He later adds that they see Huang “not just as a leader but as a prophet. Jensen was a prophet who made predictions about things. And then those things came true.” He has a ferocious temper—referred to in the company as “the Wrath of Huang”—and is notorious for publicly reprimanding, at length, workers who have made mistakes or failed to deliver. But he rarely fires people and, in fact, inspires intense devotion. One of his key subordinates says, “I’ve been afraid of Jensen sometimes. But I also know that he loves me.” Read: Jensen Huang is tech’s new alpha dog Huang’s greatest strength as a CEO has been his willingness to make big, risky bets when opportunities present themselves. The first of those came when he changed the architecture of Nvidia’s chips from serial processing to parallel processing. Witt calls this move “a radical gamble,” because up to that point, no company had been able to make selling parallel-processing chips a viable business. Serial computing is the way your computer’s central processing unit works: It executes one instruction at a time, very, very fast. Witt likens it to telling one delivery van to drop off packages in sequence. By contrast, “Nvidia’s parallel GPU acts more like a fleet of motorcycles spreading out across a city,” with the drivers delivering each package at roughly the same time. The coding required to make parallel processing work was much more complex, but if you could do it, you had access to enormous amounts of computing power. Initially, all that power was used mainly to make computer games look and perform better. But then Huang took another big risk, remaking Nvidia’s GPUs so that they could also process massive data sets, of the kind scientists might use. As one Nvidia executive puts it, “You have a video game card on one side, but it has a switch on it. So you flick that switch, and turn the card over, and suddenly the card becomes a supercomputer.” The fascinating thing about this decision was that Huang didn’t know who might want to buy a supercomputer in the guise of a graphics card, or how many such people were out there. He was just betting that if you make powerful tools available to people, they will find a use for them, and at a scale to justify the billions in investment. That use—and it was big—turned out to be artificial intelligence, in particular neural-network technology. As Witt notes, just as parallel processing was revolutionizing computing, a similar revolution was happening in AI research—though no one at Nvidia was paying attention to it. AI had gone through a series of boom-and-bust cycles as researchers tried different techniques, all of which ultimately failed. One of those methods was neural networks, which tried to mimic the human brain and allow the AI to evolve new rules of learning on its own. When you train these networks on massive databases of images and text, they can, over time, identify patterns and become smarter. Neural networks had long been peripheral, partly because they’re black boxes (you can’t explain how the AI is learning, or why it’s doing what it’s doing), and partly because the computing power required to make a high-performance neural network operate was out of reach. Parallel-processing GPUs changed all that. Suddenly, AI researchers, if they could write software well enough to get the most out of the chips, had access to sufficient computing power to allow neural networks to evolve at an extraordinary pace. In 2009, Geoff Hinton, one of the godfathers of AI research, told a conference of machine-learning experts to go buy Nvidia cards. And in 2012, one of Hinton’s students, Alex Krizhevsky, strung together two Nvidia GPUs and built and trained SuperVision (which he later renamed AlexNet). It was an AI model that could, for the first time, identify images with startling accuracy, largely because, in Witt’s words, “the GPU produced in half a minute what would have taken an Intel machine an hour and what would have taken biology a hundred thousand years.” Huang did not immediately recognize the importance of what had happened. When he spoke at Nvidia’s annual GPU Technology Conference in 2013, he never mentioned neural networks, talking instead about weather modeling and computer graphics. But a few months later, after an Nvidia researcher named Bryan Catanzaro made a direct pitch to him about the importance of AI, Huang had what Witt calls a “Damascene epiphany”: He placed another big bet, essentially transforming Nvidia from a graphics company into an AI company over the course of a weekend. This bet was less risky than his earlier ones, because even though Nvidia had competitors who also built GPUs, none of them had really designed theirs to be used as supercomputers. Still, going all in was prescient—developments such as large language models had yet to take off—and is what has turned Nvidia into a nearly $3 trillion company. Read: The lifeblood of the AI boom That weekend feels as if it were the compressed culmination of Nvidia’s story, which isn’t empirically true. The 12 years that followed have been incredibly eventful, and incredibly profitable, as the company has kept improving its chips, servicing the insatiable appetite for computing power created by the emergence of LLMs, and fending off competitors (many of whom are Nvidia’s customers, now building their own chips). But the foundations for that pivot, and all that ensued, were already in place when Huang decided to act on his AI insight. Those foundations, The Thinking Machine makes clear, were not laid by Nvidia alone. Indeed, among Witt’s key contributions is to show that Nvidia’s success can’t be understood apart from the culture and economy of Silicon Valley (and of tech more generally). Take the simple fact of free labor markets. One catalyst of the Valley’s success, as the scholar AnnaLee Saxenian has famously argued, was a freewheeling, risk-taking culture that encouraged workers to leave companies for competitors or to start their own firms. And that depended, in part, on the fact that noncompete clauses were unenforceable in California. Nvidia’s history exemplifies this: not just Huang’s mobility, but that of his early hires as well. Later, one of the company’s favorite tactics was to poach its competitors’ best engineers and coders—bad form, perhaps, but a good business tactic. Nvidia also benefited from the research investments made by the government and universities. One of the crucial breakthroughs in unlocking the power of parallel computing, for instance, was an open-source programming language called Brook, which a gamer and Stanford graduate student named Ian Buck developed with a group of researchers in 2003, relying on a Defense Department grant. Alex Krizhevsky and his partner Ilya Sutskever (who later helped start OpenAI) were grad students at the University of Toronto when Krizhevsky devised AlexNet. The contest in which the model demonstrated its accuracy, the ImageNet challenge, was designed by a Stanford computer scientist named Fei-Fei Li. And as that lineup demonstrates (Krizhevsky and Sutskever were born in the Soviet Union, Li in China), immigration has been central to the history of not just Nvidia but AI generally. Practical economic features of the ecosystem mattered as well. The most important was the rise of independent chip foundries: factories that serve many different companies and make chips on order. Nvidia’s partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the best-known of these factories, allowed it to become a dominant player by focusing on designing and writing software for its chips; Nvidia didn’t have to invest in actual production, which would have required prohibitive amounts of capital. From the September 2023 issue: Does Sam Altman know what he’s creating? Finally, Nvidia benefited from patience, and its board’s willingness to put long-term thinking ahead of short-term profits. Because of the gaming market, Nvidia was almost always a profitable company, but its stock price dropped nearly 90 percent two different times; it didn’t appreciate for a full 10 years after the dot-com bubble burst, while the company was spending billions turning its graphics cards into supercomputers. One familiar indictment of American capitalism is that it’s too short-term-focused. In the tech industry, at least, the trajectory of Nvidia (and many other companies) suggests that’s a bum rap. To be sure, Huang himself was central to Nvidia’s success: He has run the company essentially on his own (as Witt puts it, he has had “no right-hand man or woman, no majordomo, no second-in-command”), and he’s made the bold moves. What’s more, he seems to have done so without a trace of doubt. Lots of people in the AI industry—including the people training LLMs—have raised concerns about AI’s dangers, but Huang is not one of them. For him, Witt writes, “AI is a pure force for progress.” Huang does not fret that it may eat all of our jobs, or replace artists, or go rogue and decide to wipe out humanity. In fact, when Witt, stricken with existential anxiety about how AI will change the world, asks Huang whether some of these concerns might be worth pondering, he is subjected to one of his legendary tirades: You could write this off as an example of Upton Sinclair’s adage “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!” But the fact that Huang talks about AI in terms of its impact on “marginal costs” shouldn’t be reduced to mere opportunism: It fits right in with the single-minded focus on performance that has driven him from Nvidia’s beginning. Witt at one point calls Huang a “visionary inventor.” The vision Huang has been in thrall to, though, seems to be less about grand future goals, and more about tools—about making the fastest, most powerful chips as efficiently as possible. “Existential risk” has no place in that vision. Huang’s unapologetic stance on AI is bracing in its way, especially in contrast with the public hand-wringing of many AI chieftains, fretting about the dangers of their LLMs while continuing to develop them. But he is in effect making the biggest, riskiest bet ever—not just for Nvidia, but for all of us. Let’s hope he’s right.

Title: How Apple Stock Can Beat Trump's Tariffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/08/how-apple-stock-can-beat-trumps-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T10:00:56Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SHANGHAI, CHINA - APRIL 7, 2025 - An flagship store of Apple Smart Products on Nanjing Road ... More Pedestrian Street in Shanghai, China on April 7, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Apple stock has fallen over 15% in the last two trading sessions after President Donald Trump announced a broad set of tariffs affecting more than 100 countries. These tariffs hit countries integral to Apple’s supply chain—namely China, Vietnam, and India. On the surface, this development appears to pose a serious challenge for Apple’s U.S. business. The iPhone—America’s top-selling device—and most other Apple products are manufactured overseas, making the company highly vulnerable to rising costs. In a worst-case scenario, Apple’s earnings could potentially decline by up to 30%. However, Apple likely has several ways to counter these effects, including price adjustments, stronger carrier collaborations, relocating production, and expanding its high-margin services segment. Also, learn how META might be impacted in META Stock To $200? What The Current Market Turmoil Means. Although it’s still uncertain how exactly these tariffs will be applied, here’s a rough worst-case scenario. Most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which is now subject to a 54% tariff. A Nikkei report from last year noted that the iPhone 16 Pro—expected to be the most popular model in the U.S.—costs Apple around $568 to produce. It retails for $1,000, providing an estimated gross margin of 43%. If tariffs raise the cost per device by over $300, the landed cost would increase to about $870, slashing the gross margin to just 13%. Apple’s Americas segment, which includes both North and Latin America, made up about 43% of total revenue last year. It’s reasonable to assume that the U.S. contributes between 25% and 30% of Apple’s total revenue. After excluding services revenue, which isn’t impacted by tariffs, roughly 20% to 25% of Apple’s income could face major margin pressure. Since other operating costs won’t drop alongside falling gross profits, the effect on net income and EPS could be even greater. A 25% to 30% hit to EPS is well within the realm of possibility. That said, Apple has several tools to help soften the blow. Raising iPhone Prices: Apple hasn’t changed the base price of its flagship iPhones in over seven years. The iPhone 16 Pro still retails for $1,000—identical to the iPhone X in 2017. Over that same period, the U.S. consumer price index has risen by about 29%. In light of this inflation, Apple could reasonably increase prices by $100 to $200 for the next iPhone without much customer pushback. Since U.S. pricing typically sets the tone globally, this could help improve margins worldwide. Partnering with Wireless Carriers: In recent years, U.S. wireless carriers have heavily subsidized iPhones to attract and retain users in an increasingly saturated market. Apple might collaborate with carriers to share the tariff burden, with carriers absorbing part of the price hike to stay competitive. Recent increases in wireless plan costs also give carriers more flexibility to offer better deals or financing options for iPhones. Increasing iPhone Production in Lower-Tariff Countries: At present, most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which now faces a steep 54% tariff. However, Apple has been scaling up production in India, which only incurs a 26% tariff. While India produced an estimated 14% of global iPhones last year, reports suggest Apple aims to raise that to 25% by 2025 and potentially up to 50% by 2027. Expediting this shift could help Apple protect its margins. Services Can Mitigate Impact: Apple’s services segment—not only its highest-margin division but also its fastest-growing—posted a 14% increase over the holiday quarter. In comparison, hardware only grew 1.5%. Services margins reached 75% in Q1 FY’25, compared to 39% for hardware. This segment has played a key role in lifting Apple’s overall margins, which climbed from 38% in FY’21 to 46% in Q1 FY’25. Continued expansion in services could help buffer the pressure on Apple’s U.S. hardware business. Apple stock may face continued pressure in the short term as more details unfold. The stakes are undeniably high. Amid economic uncertainty, ask yourself this: will you hold on to your Apple shares, or will you panic if the stock drops further? Holding onto a falling stock is never easy.

Title: Shopify's Toby Lütke doubles down on his hardcore 2025 messaging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-toby-lutke-efficiency-mandatory-messaging-internal-memo-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke is going all in on hardcore tech messaging. In a memo to employees that he posted on X on Monday, Lütke wrote: "In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify." "This sounds daunting, but given the nature of the tools, this doesn't even sound terribly ambitious to me anymore," Lütke wrote, referring to artificial intelligence. The memo — titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation" — directed employees to ramp up their AI usage at the Canadian e-commerce firm. Lütke said using the technology is "now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify" and that AI usage would be gauged in performance and peer review questionnaires. He added that the expectations apply to himself and all executives as well. The CEO appears to be reversing his reputation as a founder who values work-life balance. Last month, in response to an X post that touted him as an example of balancing work and family, Lütke wrote: "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend. I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Lütke has since deleted most of his 2019 tweets, including one that said: "I've never worked through a night. The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so. I need 8ish hours of sleep a night. Same with everybody else, whether we admit it or not." In 2023, Lütke restricted Shopify employees from having side hustles, saying the company required their "unshared attention." The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Shopify CEO's remarks reflect a broader cultural crackdown on Big Tech workers, who have enjoyed a work culture known for office perks, top-line pay, and job security, sometimes without grueling hours. Across the industry, free massages and football tables have been replaced with messaging around "efficiency" and "scrappiness and frugality." At tech giants like Amazon and TikTok, pandemic-era work-from-home luxuries have been replaced by strict return-to-office mandates. At nearly every company, layoffs have taken a wrecking ball to the industry and AI adoption has cut hiring, making job security a thing of the past. "We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his RTO memo in September. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration." Workers who spoke to Business Insider said they are feeling the pressure to work longer hours, go beyond what is asked of them, be highly visible, and evaluate other options beyond full-time work.

Title: Thanks to the Trump tariffs, Framework has paused US sales of some laptops

Framework recently announced that it is temporarily stopping the US sales of certain laptops, specifically the base Framework Laptop 13 (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). The company, in an X post, cited the new tariffs that President Trump imposed just days ago, on April 5. Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we’re temporarily pausing US sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). For now, these models will be removed from our US site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them. When questioned about why it was pausing sales in the US, the company claimed that it priced its laptops when the import tariffs on Taiwan were 0%. Now that there's a baseline 10% tariff on all foreign-origin goods, the company says, "we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss," adding that it is not alone in this decision, as other manufacturers have taken similar measures but aren't open about it. The "reciprocal" tariffs that Trump introduced have hit the tech industry very hard. Many tech companies were notably affected: Tesla's stock fell by 43%, Nvidia's by 30%, Apple's by 27%, Alphabet's by 23%, Amazon's by 21%, Microsoft's by 16%, and Meta Platforms' by 14%. Nintendo's launch of the Switch 2 console coincided with the introduction of tariffs ranging from 34% to 49% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, where Nintendo sources components. Since Nintendo did not account for the tariffs in its pricing, this caused the company to pause US pre-orders to assess the impact of the tariffs. Framework and Nintendo are not the only companies affected by the tariffs. You can check out our report on how, thanks to Trump, you could be paying more for your next Samsung device since the South Korean tech giant does not have an assembly line in the US. And for your next iPhone, you could also be paying as much as $2,300, with the price possibly shooting up to the $30K to $100K range if all the components were made in the US.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Fundamental News and Triggers Risk-off mood triggers broad-based liquidation · Following the initial tariff pronouncements in the United States, investors thought that the worst of the uncertainty would pass. Instead, the reality has proven to be more severe. With tariffs exceeding forecasts and little indication of discussions, markets are rapidly pricing in the prospect of a worldwide recession, beginning with the United States. The risk-off mood has resulted in widespread liquidation across asset classes. Traditional safe havens like gold have not been spared. · Despite the short-term fear, the medium- to long-term outlook for gold remains favourable. The current climate, which is characterized by volatility, economic uncertainty, and central bank buying, tends to favour gold. · Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated the Fed’s “wait-and-see” approach to the emerging volatility last week. The announcement of the March CPI this week will be key. If inflation data continues to soften, it may bolster the case for further rate reduction, thus reigniting demand for gold. Technical Triggers · The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). · Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). 1.

In my view, this final phase will give way to a sharp, euphoric rally that could mislead many into thinking stability has returned. While sentiment remains bearish, I foresee a surge in the S&P with potential upside targets of 6300–6700 over the next 6–8 months, marking what could be a classic blow-off top before a significant correction.

Economy ▶\Economic Update ▶\April 7, 2025 ▶\ The swift shift in global sentiment, high market volatility, and fear of US/global recession amid the tariff shock cement our conviction of a 25bps cut this week, with possible change in stance to ‘accommodative’ to give directional easing bias. The fluid global dynamics will require the RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia from EMs. While the extent of trade war pain is unclear, monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India. FY26 growth and inflation risk are skewed to the downside. However, we do not see RBI front-loading its ammunition, rather it may keep it ready for rain(ier) days. We will keep a lookout for any overhaul of the current liquidity framework in the near term and fiddle with non-conventional easing tools ahead apart from conventional easing, if the growth situation worsens or financial stability is disrupted. 1) Global uncertainty to dominate policy discussions Global sentiment has seen a shift and is rippling through the equity, bond, and FX markets in the thick of tariff shock and geopolitical concerns. Amid great policy and trade uncertainty, the overarching theme is increasing recessionary fears in the US and possibly even the global economy, led by macroeconomic shocks if these policies are sustained. Over this period, the Fed’s policy choices will become complicated with too many moving parts, as the US moves over time/swiftly from stagflation to recession. However, the eventual response will be counter-cyclical. Market pricing for Fed cuts has increased to five cuts from two, while market recession probability has crossed 60%. EM central banks, including the RBI, may follow suit eventually, but will also need to confront various push-and-pull factors via the financial market route, even with increasing easing biases. We believe the readiness of possible policy tools would dominate policy discussion within the MPC. 2) Liquidity management to remain swift amid global sell-off The tariff shock has increased our conviction that the RBI will cut 25bps this week, with further easing ahead. This could also be accompanied by a change in stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ to give directional easing bias. The aim would be to facilitate faster monetary policy transmission – something that the RBI has evidently displayed by the swift liquidity injection. System liquidity has swung from the super high deficit of Rs3.2trn in Jan-25 to a surplus of Rs800bn by end Mar-25. This has been partly helped by a durable liquidity injection of nearly Rs6trn in 4QFY25, followed by another round of Rs800bn OMO calendar in April. We see 1QFY26E to be in surplus liquidity, led by ~30% higher-than-budgeted RBI dividend and a sharp seasonal moderation in currency in circulation, albeit countered by i) continuous need for spot FX intervention amid tariff led volatility – May is historically poor for the rupee, and ii) maturity of RBI’s heavy forward net short FX book, unless rolled over. The RBI is likely to assure prompt actions amid any tightening in financial conditions. 3) India’s FY26 growth and inflation risk skewed to the downside It may be too early to consider actual forecast changes, but to state the obvious: risks to the RBI’s FY26 growth of 6.7% are materially downward. This will emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if such global tariffs are maintained. The disinflationary impulse for Indian industry could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. Asia has been hit much more than India on tariffs, and India is less export-exposed vs EM Asia, but is unlikely to be non-synced with EM Asia on the cyclical downturn. China’s survival response to the massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia. FX as a counter tool may be used by China, and will have FX implications for rest of Asia/India. 4) RBI to keep policy options handy amid global uncertainty The extent to which this global trade war could stretch is unclear. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more countercyclical than fiscal this year. Implications for India could stem from both, global financial market disruptions and real sector hit. While there is scope for negotiation and de-escalation, we think this could be a pivotal turning point for EM assets in coming months, as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia. The RBI may not want to use all the ammunition too soon, given fluid global markets, and may thus not frontload cuts in April. Options like i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, ii) lower daily CRR requirement for banks to sub 90%, ii) sterilized INR management, etc may be used, if needed. Near-term, however, there may be some overhaul of the liquidity framework in favor of daily VRRs instead of 14-day VRR, as the primary tool for easier ALM and liquidity management for banks. Gift Nifty’s 331-point jump comes after a sharp market sell-off yesterday, where India VIX spiked 66% to 22.79, reflecting a collapse in bullish sentiment amid global turmoil. The catalyst? Trump’s aggressive tariff stance, triggering fears of a full-blown trade war with China hiking tariffs to 34%. Until tensions cool, Nifty may face continued pressure. Traders are watching for the RBI’s potential 25bps rate cut on April 9th and corporate earnings led by TCS on April 10th. Key support for Nifty lies at 21,281. Meanwhile, bearish bets are on stocks like ADANI ENTERPRISES, OBEROI REALTY, and M&M, with Adani seen slipping from overbought zones.

Title: SSA reorg plan contemplates field office closures, contradicting public statements

Two people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit. Jim West / UCG / Universal Images Group / Getty Images Stay Connected Erich Wagner and Natalie Alms Updated April 7 at 8:27 p.m. ET A draft plan for service delivery at the Social Security Administration includes “field office consolidation” as a goal for next year — even as the agency maintains publicly that it isn’t closing field offices. SSA posted Monday on X that it “is NOT permanently closing field offices. Only underutilized hearing office space has been closed and without permanently closing field offices.” But a plan circulating within the agency includes a goal to “further reduce footprint” in 2026 and beyond. The scope of the envisioned "consolidations" is unclear, though the document singles out field offices as on the chopping block next year. This comes after billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency posted information about nearly 50 field offices it was planning to shutter. SSA has said that news reports about plans to close field offices are incorrect. The draft plan, originally sent March 21 and obtained by Government Executive, is required by the Trump administration by April 14 as part of its push to gut the federal workforce and reorganize agencies. Asked for comment Monday, SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann wrote, "There is no validity to this claim." At the same time the agency is contemplating plans to shutter offices, it also is moving ahead with new identity proofing requirements expected to push more people to those offices. SSA is ending phone service for many of its benefits applications, as well as those looking to make changes to their direct deposit information, leaving them with online or in-person avenues to do so. Some regional leaders that oversee field offices still haven’t gotten guidance on implementing the changes, which are scheduled to take place next week, according to one current employee. SSA is also looking to shed thousands of employees. The March 21 document says that the agency plans to cut 5,500 employees by the end of the fiscal year as part of the agency’s plan to get down to 50,000 employees, as Government Executive previously reported. Martin O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during the final year of President Biden’s term, said that several elements of the plan, including further consolidations of the agency’s phone systems under Amazon Web Services and the development of a “digital service index” that elucidates which agency services can be conducted by phone, online or in-person, were already under discussion during his tenure. But none of it can be effectively done while reducing staff at the agency, which is already at a half-century low. “Except for the butchering of an agency that has already been reduced to a 50-year low in staffing, many of these things were things we had put into motion during my team, and some of it reflects the good work of the Office of Transformation ... A lot of those things should happen, but none will make up for the gutting the staff at this already depleted agency with a chainsaw,” he said. One operations component that formerly had about 400 feds now has only half that number, one current SSA employee told Government Executive. The office, a recent creation of what used to be two components, handles both operations support as well as some technology functions. “With the Regional offices gutted… no one will be left to support field offices when they have difficulty,” said the employee. Rich Couture, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees’ SSA General Committee, said he was alarmed to see the plan mention a hiring freeze at the agency, when Trump’s hiring freeze executive order specifically exempted employees who work on the delivery of Social Security benefits. He also noted that the reassignment of employees from regional and headquarters offices to frontline work constitutes a brain drain, both from those back-of-house components and from the frontline workforce. “From the union’s perspective, it made no sense to offer buyouts and early retirement to experienced frontline staff just to turn around and fill those vacancies with people who have no frontline experience, who will need months of training and years of on-the-job experience to become proficient in these complex programs,” Couture said. “And in order to train them, you need to take staff off the frontline to do so. It was an easily avoidable problem.” Couture said he too has heard concerns from frontline workers about the potential impact of the regional office consolidations and reassignments on the support employees in field offices and hearings offices need to do their jobs. “A lot of these components have positions that don’t make sense to put in a field office or a hearing office–you wouldn’t put an HR staffer into one of these offices, because it makes sense to have these staffed regionally and centrally,” he said. “One of the big concerns I’ve heard from employees of late is: What happens if all of these HR personnel are reassigned or RIFed and there’s not enough people to do the job, and then I decide at a later date that I want to retire or need to take some action with my insurance? That hasn’t been fleshed out yet.” SSA intends to push people online, the plan notes, by expanding what the public can do online with SSA, as opposed to going to an office in person or calling. Recently, however, people looking to reach the agency online have seen system outages as a result of new anti-fraud checks at the agency. The agency has also warned staff in its Office of the Chief Information Officer — which handles the agency's tech and is being led by a DOGE associate — of coming layoffs, calling the office's work "not mission critical,” one SSA employee told Government Executive. The agency says that it wants to ramp up the use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle calls. It hopes to use technology more broadly “to serve our increasing customer base with fewer employees,” the plan notes, including by fully automating the processing of most retirement and Medicare claims. O’Malley said the combination of increased anti-fraud measures–for an agency whose error rate is already under 1%–and funneling more people into online and AI-powered service lanes will crush the public’s faith in the agency. “There are things we could do to improve the level of customer service and ease of transaction for citizens and customers, but eliminating half the staff of the IT department is not one of those things and closing field offices is not one of those things,” he said. “Shutting down portals that had worked, whether online or via phone, to drive more people into the field offices–those are the things that actually destroy and degrade customer service, that appear designed to sour the public against the agency by cramming them into field offices.” Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the plans surrounding Medicare claims.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Worth Buying The Dip?

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp; You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019. Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company. Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates. The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook: January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%. The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will "transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries." Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC. Nvidia announced expanded GeForce Now device support and capabilities at the 2025 CES trade show. Nvidia’s automotive line-up includes a platform for in-vehicle computing plus solutions for training AI driving models and simulating environments for testing. In 2025, the company announced automotive AI partnerships with Toyota, Aurora, Continental, GM, Gatik and Torc. Nvidia expects its automotive business to deliver fiscal 2026 revenue of $5 billion, up from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Alongside these opportunities, Nvidia faces some challenges. Regulatory changes, cheaper AI solutions and in-house chip development top the list. Changing Trump administration policies could pressure Nvidia’s stock price. Reciprocal tariffs, even with semiconductors excluded, could raise input costs and reduce margins. While Huang seems unbothered by the trade war developments, he also said he could move manufacturing to the U.S. if needed. That is a long-term solution. Unfortunately, growth investors are not known for their patience. A transition to domestic manufacturing would impact the NVDA stock price. More concerning than tariffs is the potential for export bans to China and import bans by China. Reports indicate Trump has considered tighter limits on chip sales to China. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators are discouraging sales of Nvidia's H20 chip—a product designed for export to China—because it doesn't meet efficiency standards, according to the Financial Times. The rollout of DeepSeek caused angst for Nvidia shareholders. At issue was the $5.6 million total investment quoted by the AI app’s creator. The price tag seems tiny next to, say, Microsoft's $80 billion AI budget for fiscal 2025. The discrepancy prompted questions about Nvidia's growth outlook. If DeepSeek can do it, why can't big tech spend far less on Nvidia's AI hardware for the same results? Some experts have said the $5.6 million number from DeepSeek is misleading. Still, there will be a time when cost-efficiency enters the AI fray. That could create space for competitors to chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance. Big tech companies don’t want Nvidia to be the only AI chip game in town. It's too risky. They are mitigating that risk by developing in-house solutions. Alphabet (GOOG) recently introduced a collection of lightweight open-source AI models, Meta (META) is testing an AI chip and OpenAI has nearly finalized the design of its AI chip. These solutions will reduce Nvidia's business with existing customers over time. Nvidia will have to improve on performance and price as a result. Nvidia is an attractive, long-term buy right now despite regulatory and competitive challenges. The stock may not return to its pre-Trump growth rates, but it is an innovative, healthy company with a forward-thinking leader—and those qualities usually create shareholder value over time. Like many growth stocks, NVDA is volatile. Its per-share price can fall as quickly as it rises. You can see that dynamic in play for NVDA stock since it went public in 1999. So this stock is best suited for hardy, patient investors and those who already own NVDA and want to reduce their average cost basis. If you don't feel quite ready for NVDA, see this list of best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas. Bottom Line Nvidia is down nearly 30% this year as investors worry about tariffs, trade bans and lower-cost AI models. But the chip designer is not down for the count. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation. After the recent downturn, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is about 32. That compares favorably to other semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Arm Holdings (ARM). Nvidia is a well-run company that can navigate financial downturns and industry shifts. Relative to its history, the company's current valuation is appealing. If you don't mind volatility and believe in the AI promise as well as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now is a good time to buy Nvidia stock. The biggest risks for Nvidia are margin degradation from tariffs, the global impact of tariffs, import and export bans and waning demand if others can replicate DeepSeek's low-power AI model.

April 07, 2025 14:37 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: OpenAI Eyes a Mysterious Startup Backed By Sam Altman and Former Apple Designer Jony Ive

OpenAI is reportedly mulling a deal to buy io Products, a hardware startup looking to make an A.I. device, for up to $500 million, The Information reported. io Products, which took shape about two years ago, involves several notable tech figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple (AAPL) designer Jony Ive. It has also attracted the attention of Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The startup took shape after Altman and Ive were introduced by AirBnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky, a close friend of Altman who has previously worked with Ive’s design studio LoveFrom, which Ive launched shortly after leaving Apple in 2019. Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple honing the company’s distinct sleek aesthetic. LoveFrom engineers, many of whom also formerly worked with Ive at Apple, are in charge of building io Products’ consumer device that could aid users in everyday tasks, according to The Information. OpenAI, meanwhile, is supplying the technology. The project’s current employees include the likes of Tang Tan, who previously led iPhone product design, and Evans Hankey, who formerly succeeded Ive to lead design efforts at Apple. It’s unclear whether Tan and Hankey would join OpenAI if a potential acquisition took place, noted The Information. What exactly io Products is working on remains a mystery. The venture has stayed silent on its plans for an A.I.-powered personal product, which could reportedly take the shape of a household device. One thing is for sure: it won’t be a traditional smartphone. “I don’t think you should try to do a better phone,” Altman told Axios of the project last year. io Products is backed by Ive himself and tech investors such as Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded Laurene Powell Jobs. As of last September, the startup was reportedly on track to raise up to $1 billion by the end of 2024. Since its rise into mainstream tech in 2022, OpenAI has made efforts to expand beyond just making A.I. models. In addition to exploring a potential web browser product that would compete with Google, the company is currently finalizing designs for its own in-house A.I. chips in a bid to reduce its dependency on Nvidia (NVDA). OpenAI is hoping to begin mass producing these chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) by next year. TSMC also manufactures chips for Nvidia and Apple.

Title: Effective Tariff Rate Hits 1909 Levels As Global Trade War Explodes

ByFrank Holmes ByFrank Holmes, Contributor. Trade protectionism by the United States of America by implementing tariffs Updated, Apr. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the name of President William Howard Taft. Ouch. Global markets are in freefall in response to President Donald Trump’s universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the U.S., with as many as 60 countries facing “reciprocal” tariffs on top of that. When we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last Wednesday, we’re looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That’s the highest such rate since 1909—the same year that President William Howard Taft proposed the idea of an income tax to Congress. Average effective tariff rate in the U.S. at highest level since 1909 As I pointed out to you last month, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. This can turbocharge domestic inflation. Tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government’s previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the Great Depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. A few decades prior, then-Representative William McKinley’s tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers. (If you need to brush up on your Smoot-Hawley history, I recommend the famous “Anyone? Anyone?” scene in 1986’s “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” which you can watch here.) As was the case then, we’re already seeing retaliatory tariffs. China announced today that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the U.S. If this weren’t enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. Trump claims he “couldn’t care less” if foreign manufacturers raise prices for U.S. consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to—and significantly so, in some cases. Mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the U.S. to offset the new levy, according to estimates by CLSA. Price increase needed to offset a 25% U.S. tariff on autos The manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is Tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the U.S. More than 62% of the company’s facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the U.S., according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, fewer than half of Ford’s facilities worldwide are currently located in the U.S. This could be constructive for Tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-December, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. The carmaker’s quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. When it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news. Mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 4% on Friday due to concerns about the trade war. Bond yields generally fall when prices rise. 10-year yield plunging on trade war fears Granted, home prices in the U.S. are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected. Lower yields are also good for gold. Because it’s a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. The 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from February, the real yield is closer to 1.3%. If yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices. The yellow metal is trading down as it’s swept up in the broader selloff, and I believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. Gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending the March quarter at $3,123 per ounce, and there could be further upside momentum. Gold notched its best quarter since 1986 I believe the number one thing investors can do at this moment is to remain calm and not panic. Last week, I attended and spoke at the Oxford Club’s Investment U conference in Florida, where many presenters offered their own advice to those who may be worried right now, especially those nearing retirement age. Dr. Nomi Prins, founder of Prinsights Global, told the audience that now may not be the time to obsess over your 401(k). No need to check it every minute. My favorite piece of advice came from my friend Alexander Green, the chief investment strategist of the Oxford Club. Green reminded the audience of America’s exceptionalism, which is no less true today than it was before markets started crashing. “If we’re no different from other Western democracies,” Green said, “why were transformative companies like Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, Netflix, Snapchat, Instagram, Tesla, Uber, Crispr and NVIDIA—to name just a few—all found here?” Green is currently working on a book on America’s exceptionalism, which I’ll be sure to pick up once it’s released. You can read my two-part interview with him from 2017 here and here. Warren Buffett, the perennial optimist, has always urged investors to look beyond the current crisis and to follow the trendlines, not the headlines. In his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he wrote that “major declines” can “offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt.” He also paraphrased lines from the British poet Rudyard Kipling’s famous poem “If,” which I’ll end with today: If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs… If you can wait and not be tired by waiting… If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim… If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you… Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.

Title: The bulls are in full retreat: These charts show the carnage on day 3 of a stunning market plunge.

The most reliable bulls on Wall Street are ringing the alarm bells as President Trump's tariffs plunge markets into chaos. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday, following the footsteps of the Nasdaq 100, which closed in bear territory on Friday. The three-day decline has grown to as much as 14%. These charts show just how painful the market implosion has been. The S&P 500 peaked at 6,144 on February 19, putting the bear market "line in the sand" for the benchmark index at about 4,915. The index hit an intraday low of 4,835 on Monday. What were the stock market's biggest winners over the past decade turned into the biggest losers so far this year. Year-to-date, Tesla is down 43%, Nvidia is down 30%, Apple is down 27%, Alphabet is down 23%, Amazon is down 21%, Microsoft is down 16%, and Meta Platforms is down 14%. The Hang Seng Index plunged 13.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since 1997. Investors aggressively sold shares on fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China. On Friday, China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs on US imports. Oil prices were already depressed over the last year, but the rollback of OPEC production cuts and fears of an economic slowdown have hammered US and global crude prices, with the commodity down 15% in three days. A potential recession would reduce demand for the commodity just as supply is increasing. Meanwhile, some of Wall Street's most enduring bulls have been forced to change their tunes as the sell-off ramps up. Here's what the three commentators have to say amid the market chaos: "If these tariffs (in current forms/rates) hold there is no debate… it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner… and we see no debate," Ives said in a note on Saturday. Ives has historically been an ardent tech bull, able to see the silver lining even in some of the most dire market scenarios over the last few years. But even for him, the trade war is hard to sugarcoat. "In one day this tariff policy if enacted will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs, major Cap-Ex delays due to uncertainty, and slow down US tech innovation… not a debate." "These reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit converted into some odd calculation) implemented would cause an economic Armageddon and stop the US tech world in its tracks...and wipe out a bright future ahead in one global policy mistake that will reverse US tech dominance in our view." "The resulting market fury is not due to a reaction to a trade war, but rather, in our view, the fact the White House broke a core covenant of capitalism — stable and predictable regulatory environment," Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Sunday. "The White House's sudden and aggressive executive orders left companies without the predictability they need to recoup capital investments, prompting vocal corporate backlash." Lee has often used stock market declines as moments to highlight opportunities for investors, but not this time. He highlighted the pain set to hit companies like Apple, which Lee noted is facing a 54% increase in production costs as a result of the tariffs on China. The result would be effectively nationalizing a third of its assets by redirecting its gross margins into tariff revenues." "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. The President's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same," Ed Yardeni said in a note on Saturday. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Wall Street matters a great deal to Main Street. Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0." "The President wasn't negotiating trade deals this weekend. He was too busy relaxing on the links." Jump to

Title: Vaio is advertising ‘tariff free’ laptop prices for a limited time

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Unless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops. To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner. According to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.” For the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. In the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive. It seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers. If you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.

After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Daniel Dines, the cofounder and, once again, the CEO of UiPath, a software company that specializes in something called robotic process automation (RPA). We’ve been featuring a lot of what I like to call full-circle Decoder guests on the show lately, and Daniel is a perfect example. He was first on Decoder back in 2022, right before he moved to a co-CEO arrangement with Rob Enslin, a Google Cloud executive brought on to help steer UiPath after it went public. In January of last year, Daniel stepped down to become chief innovation officer and Rob stepped up to become sole CEO — and then, less than six months later, Rob resigned, and Daniel took his job as sole CEO back. Founders stepping aside for outside CEOs and then returning as CEO later on is quite a trope in the tech world, and Daniel and I spent a while pulling his version of that story apart. He made some pretty key decisions along the way to relinquishing control of the company he founded — and then some equally important decisions when coming back. If you’re a Decoder listener, you know I’m fascinated by the middle part of these stories that usually gets glossed over, so we really dug in here. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! But there’s a lot more going on with UiPath than C-suite shuffles — the company was founded to sell automation software. That entire market is being upended by AI, particularly agentic AI, which is supposed to click around on the internet and do things for you. The main technology UiPath has been selling for years now is RPA, which has been around since the early 2000s. It aims to solve a pretty big problem that a lot of organizations have. Let’s say you run a hospital with ancient billing software. You could spend millions upgrading that software and the computers it runs on at great risk, or you could just hire UiPath to build an RPA system for you that automates that software and presents a much nicer interface to users. This decreases the risk of upgrading all that software, it makes your users happier because they’re using a much nicer interface, and it might provide you some efficiency by developing new automated workflows along the way. UiPath built a fairly successful business doing that basic version of RPA; I encourage you to listen to our episode in 2022 where we unpack it in great detail. But as you might expect, that’s all getting upended by agentic AI systems that promise to automate things in much more powerful ways, with much simpler natural language interfaces. So Daniel has to figure out how UIPath can integrate and deploy AI into its products — or risk being made obsolete. Daniel and I really got into that, and then I also wanted to push him on the practical economics of the business. The big AI startups like Anthropic and OpenAI don’t have to make any profits right now. They’re just raising mountains of investment and promising massive returns when all of this AI works. But UiPath is a public company, and it’s licensing this technology at a cost. So I wanted to know what Daniel thought about the cost of licensing AI tech, selling it to customers, and trying to have all of that make a profit while the underlying economics of the AI industry itself remain pretty unsettled. We also talked about what all of this might mean for our experiences at work, and whether a world of robots sending emails to other robots is actually a good goal. This one really goes places — Daniel was game to truly dig in. I think you’ll like it. Okay, UiPath CEO Daniel Dines. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Daniel Dines, you’re the founder and — once again — the CEO of UiPath. Welcome back to Decoder. Thank you so much for having me, Nilay. I’m very excited to talk to you. I love a full circle episode of Decoder. You were last on the show in the spring of 2022. It’s been a little bit of a roller coaster since then. You were just about to have a co-CEO named Rob Enslin. You hired him from Google Cloud. Then, you stepped down a little over a year ago to focus on being the chief innovation officer. Then, Rob was the sole CEO. Then, Rob stepped down, and now you’re CEO again. You’ve made some changes to the company. Explain what’s going on there, because that’s a lot of decisions. Obviously, we’re a show about decisions, and there’s a lot of AI stuff I want to talk about. But let’s start with that little bit of history. Why step down and why come back? Well, roller coaster is a good word. Sometimes people exaggerate with it, but in our case, it’s really what happened. Why? Look, I was always trying to do what’s best for this company. This company is, in a way, my baby. I spent almost 20 years [building it]. This year, 2025, is 20 years since I founded UiPath. I thought that if we can get the best talent, and especially with [Enslin’s] background in go-to-market, this is going to help us. And Rob is a nice guy. We got along pretty well. And look, it’s been mostly a good ride. It gave me some time off, so I switched to chief innovation officer. I ran our product and engineering teams. In 2023, I had my own time for reflection, especially after I moved a lot of my responsibilities to Rob. I spent that summer in reflection mode, honestly, with a bit of soul searching around “what do I want?” I would say that I missed my early 20s craziness, with people having a lot of fun and going on spring break. I had to work. In post-communist Romania, there was a lot of turmoil, so life was not that fun for me at that stage. I thought maybe I will get to experience what it means to take it a little bit easier. It was important for me because I discovered that UiPath is actually kind of an anchor for me. It gives me a framework of mind, a direction. It’s very hard for me to wake up every day and give myself something to do unless I am in this big machine and this machine is on a trajectory. It forced my mind to be there. And I’m surrounded by great people. I talk to smart investors, analysts, customers, and partners. It’s a living organism. So, I discovered that this is a gift that I have, being in the position to run this company. Then, things in early 2024 didn’t go well for us, from an overall market perspective. I think the macro was pretty bad for some companies. We had some execution issues. Our initial go-to-market was “land and expand,” and we over-rotated the company to go mostly after big deals. So, our float business suffered, and paired with some of the macro challenges, it created a difficult environment. Rob decided to leave the company in May 2024. In all fairness, at the time, I was ready to take it back. It came faster than I anticipated, but mentally I was prepared after my summer and my time off. Did you go on a spring break? Did you take a minute? Were you in Palm Beach? No, no, I didn’t go to Palm Beach, but I spent a few weeks in the Mediterranean on a boat. So maybe close to it. Spring break is not the same in your 40s as it is in your 20s, is the thing that I’ve discovered. Yeah, exactly. I always want to drill into the actual moments of change. I always joke that I watch a lot of music documentaries. There’s act one where everyone’s in the garage, and there’s act three where they’re playing Shea Stadium. And act two, where the actual moments of change happen, are often glossed over. This is one of those moments. You made a decision to come back as CEO, Rob made a decision to leave. What was that conversation like? Did you initiate it? Did he start it? Was he leaving and you already decided that you were coming back? Walk us through it. It was simple actually. We decided to meet in New York following Q1 2024. He told me that he thought it was better that I take the company back and he resign for personal reasons. Indeed, he needed to take some time off because some members of his family were not well. I told him, “Let’s reflect a bit on this. Let’s think a bit.” But in the end, he was resolute in his decision. I also realized after that discussion that there will be many changes in the company. We needed to contract a bit. We oversized the company for this elephant hunting, so there needed to be a few changes. And I realized it’s actually better that I do the changes. It’s going to be a lot of pain, and we’ve already been through some pain. The last three quarters were not easy for us by any metric. Would you have made the change if he hadn’t volunteered? Was it obvious to you that you were going to come back as CEO? I realized something. It would be difficult to get an external CEO while I am here. It’s kind of not possible. I would consider growing someone internally rather than bringing in someone externally. It’s really hard to know someone after you talk for a few hours and you go for a dinner, and it affects the culture of a company so much. Even if I have the controlling stake of the company, it’s not like you get someone and you can command them every day, “You do this and this and this.” No, it has a really huge implications. I care deeply about the company and the people. Rob had all the best intentions in the world, but seeing the things that sometimes made me uncomfortable, it was not easy, and it’s not easy for anyone. Naturally, there were two camps created — Daniel Camp and Rob Camp — and sometimes they didn’t talk. Again, without our intention, it was a dynamic that didn’t work well. So to me, it was clear that I had to either take back the CEO role and drive the company, or next time I would step down completely. This is a pretty common problem with founders. Obviously, The Verge is much smaller than UiPath, but I only have a handful of co-founders left. I often tell people that they should be the editor-in-chief, and it’s perceived as a threat. They’re like, “No, we wouldn’t do it if you were here.” Did you have the power as the founder and the controlling stakeholder to say, “I’m just making this decision, I’m coming back?” Was there an approval process? This is one of those moments that seems like it comes up a bunch with founders. Theoretically, I had the power to do this, but in practical terms, it’s something very difficult to do. Look, we are a public company. It’s board governance. I have a seat on the board. The board should make the decision. So, the board would have to make a collective decision to fire Rob on my pressure. They could have mutinied against me, but it’s not so simple. It’s doable, but– That’s really the question. We see some of these decisions from the outside. The founder coming back as a CEO seems like a very natural course of events, but then it’s very complicated on the inside, particularly with founders who were the CEO, stepped aside for another CEO, and then came back. If there is a battle between the founder and the CEO, yes, things could be pretty ugly. In our case, it really was not. Rob really exited under the best conditions. He gave me all the time. He assisted me with the transition. He then took some time off to fix his personal stuff. From this perspective, it was a smooth transition. You mentioned the company had grown in ways you didn’t want it to. With a new CEO, there are cultural implications with how they would like to run the company. Then as the founder, you come back and want to change it back. You just reported financial results. Things seem to be a little more stable than they were in the past. What changes have you made, either to go in a forward direction or to go back to the way things were when you were CEO? I wanted to bring back some of our mojo of being customer-centric, working with customers, and doing whatever they required to be successful. We went back largely to “land and expand,” to being customer-centric while still preserving the muscle to do big deals. We need both. Forecasting is kind of difficult in a company that depends only on big deals. The lumpiness in revenue can create issues with forecasting. It’s normal to have both sides of the equation. That’s also a thing that I didn’t realize. We’re not a technology that you can go day one and say, “I will sell you a $100 million of automation.” Let’s see a smaller division and see how it works. Then, expand into other divisions, and then company-wide. So, regardless if you have a good Rolodex, you won’t go to another CEO and say, “Okay my friend, give me this big deal because I’m here for you, and I promise you we’ll do it best.” You need to prove it, and you need to earn your way into a company. That’s why, in our DNA, the essence is to stay extremely customer-centric, work with them, help them find opportunities, help them deliver the value, prove the value, and have them message internally about the benefits of automation. We kind of lost a bit of this muscle. And now, we’ve segmented differently. I created an executive accounting program where we have our top 50 diamond accounts with all our executives attached to those accounts, and we are taking it very seriously. We also have a co-innovation program where we build software together. We decentralized our customer success function that was centrally run. It was a bit disjointed from the sales motion, so we decentralized it into the region, and it’s much more aligned with the customer right now. We even changed the compensation of our sellers and customer success to be closer to the adoption of our software. Regional partners were also moved within the sales teams. I simplified and streamlined the international part of our business into one big region. There have really been a lot of changes. Were all those changes in your head while you were the chief innovation officer? You were watching the company change and the results, and you were thinking, “This is how I would fix it?” Or did you come to this plan after you retook the CEO role? I think some of the pain that we were experiencing was known at that point. The changes? Not really so much. It took me a month to understand who the people on my team would be and what kind of changes we were going to make. I love having people come back on the show because I get to read their old decision-making frameworks back to them. You left, you took a break, you got to think about who you wanted to be and how you wanted to spend your time. The last time you were on the show I asked, “How do you make decisions?” You said, “I’m trying to learn more by listening to people. I have no idea how to run a big company at this stage because I have never been in a similar situation before, but I’m trying to build a close-knit executive team that relies on each other.” Then, you said the thing people say, which is to “[make decisions] fast if they can be reversed, and do them slowly if they’re irreversible.” Is that still your framework? Have you come to a different approach? Are those still the basics? I think largely, yes. I like to give space to people to delegate. My style is to agree on goals, agree on the plans, and then let the people run. If I find issues, even small issues, my style is to dig around to see if there are signs of potential cancer or things that are completely not working. You discover interesting things. But yes, I think the faith of the company depends extremely on the cohesion of the leadership team. A big difference in how I make hiring decisions compared to 2022 is that I will never trade chemistry for talent. Bringing talent that doesn’t fit into an organization never works, and long term, it creates really big issues. I asked you about the structure of the company last time, and you had a really interesting answer. You didn’t talk about the structure at all. You talked about the culture and said you want the culture of the company to be “one single word.” The word you picked was “humility,” and you talked about that for a minute. It’s been two years since then. I’ve come to believe that the structure question is really a proxy for a culture question. By describing the structure of the company, you’re describing the culture. Would you still pick “humility” if I asked you to describe the culture of the company? I think at that time, humility was the most-needed aspect because we rode a very successful IPO, and our stock was very high. Many people made a lot of money. We lost a bit of humility at that point. Right now, we are back to our roots. I think the company has been through pain, and we understand better. Look, I am not smart enough to learn from successes, and UiPath is not smart enough to learn from successes, but I think we are smart enough to learn from pain and suffering. Humility was in the genesis of our company and it’s an integral part. What we need now more is to be bold and fast. We are making a big push into our agentic automation era, and I see great things happening. It’s a new energy. Also, we ran RPA (robotic process automation) for seven, eight years. There was a bit of fatigue at the end. We were just perfecting the software and getting into some white spaces, but it was not that exciting. Agentic AI brings a lot of excitement to the table. We pivoted in product and engineering overnight basically, more than half of the organization into building the new agentic products. All the teams are energized because they know. We basically put agentic automation as our number one priority as a company. We literally changed direction. It’s not the Titanic, but it’s a big boat. I think very few companies have a chance for an act two, and we have this chance. AI and automation are so synergetic. I think more and more people came to that conclusion. Agentic, in essence, is AI plus automation. It’s the fusion of AI and automation. We’re so well-positioned to deliver on this promise. So our product and engineering is going at a breakneck pace, making really bold decisions. From a technology standpoint, we’ve replatformed our workflow engine to a more modern technology. They really embodied being bold and fast. I cannot say yet that this is true for other parts of the company, and this is where I work with our leaders to be completely prepared for our act two. I’m going to ask one more question about structure, and then I have a lot of questions about agentic AI and automation. One of the big decisions you made when you took over the role as sole CEO once again is you cut about 400 people. You laid off 10 percent of the company. Did you end up restructuring around that cut? Why make that decision, and what was the goal? We looked into our central functions at that point. And in all fairness, we over-hired people in those central functions, and we had to streamline the organization. Decisions to fire people are the hardest from an emotional standpoint, from a cultural standpoint, and financially. It’s very hard to make them. Every time we had to do them, it’s been a thorough process. I was never rushing, and I was always fighting more on “do we really need to?” And it came at one of the lowest moments for us, along with the CEO changes. I think now, as we put it behind us, we are more prepared. The world is in an interesting, challenging phase right now. Nobody knows where it’s going to go. I think we as a company are a bit more prepared, more streamlined, and agile. We took time to heal the pain, and I think the confidence in the company is restoring. Looking back, I think that was the right thing to do for the company. I wanted to ask that question as the lead-in to AI. You’re describing making these cuts as a low moment, as something that was very difficult to do. The right decision, but very difficult to do. You pull the thread on AI, and what I hear from our audience is, “This automation is going to come for our companies and we will all be out of a job.” White-collar workers will be out of a job. Software engineers might be out of a job. Lawyers are terrified of being out of a job. Do you see that connection, that if your software is successful you will reorient the economy and a lot of people might lose their jobs? If we are realistic right now, it’s all a matter of the time of change, not the change itself. Your job and my job have changed over time. Jobs change. It’s a matter of when it’s going to be and how compressed the change is. Right now, I’m not so fearful that it’s going to come so suddenly. If you look at AI and the real use cases, we still have to see widespread adoption. It’s a productivity gain right now, more like an assistant type of AI. I ask something, I get that response, I do my job a bit faster and better. It’s not at the point yet to affect really huge volumes of the population. I think agentic AI is one of the steps toward deploying AI into more of an enterprise context, and it might accelerate the way jobs are transforming. What do I mean by this? I think a job today is not a simple task. There are very few people whose job you can describe as one single task. So a job is a multitude of operational things, repetitive things, and many ad hoc things. It depends on different environments and businesses. I think that many repetitive tasks have been solved. We have the technology to basically eliminate many of them from one’s job. Now we also have the technology to help people with more of these ad hoc tasks, like research tasks. I think the jobs will be moved more toward where people make decisions. They’ll analyze what information agents are retrieving and what they’re putting together. Agents plus automation. People will analyze, will make decisions, and then the actions will be carried on by enterprise workflows, robots that we already have. So jobs will transform more into decision-making, inspections, and overseeing from a command plane. I think about this all the time. I don’t know that I’m a great editor-in-chief. I feel like you could automate me by just walking into rooms and having a soundboard that says “make it shorter” or “make it longer,” and you just spin the wheel and pick one. But I know when to say those things because I spent years writing blog posts, then stories, and now podcasting. I have all this experience executing the decisions so that I have a high level of confidence in the decisions that I’m making when I make them. How do you get that if no one is executing the decisions? If that’s all robots? I just want to make a comparison to you. You were the founder, you spent all this time running this company. How would you make good decisions if you didn’t have all of that experience? The execution experience? Yeah. That’s a good question. Eventually, many things will be like a black box. I don’t know why if I press a key on my keyboard it displays on the screen, but I can make the decision to press. In a way, operations will be like a black box for many companies, and decisions will be at a higher level. I think we can still make decisions even if we don’t know how things are cooked behind the scenes. I’m curious how that plays out. I am of the school that says the best leaders are the ones who spent time on the ground. That’s not always true. I’ve talked to a lot of leaders on the show, but particularly when I talk to founders, that experience at every stage of the company is what informs the confidence to make changes. If operations are a black box, I wonder where that confidence comes from. I need to reflect more on that. Probably the best people will understand the operations as well. Even if they are carried out by robots and AI, they will understand in order to make better decisions and change the operations. But this is more of an analytical type of person. The types of jobs where there’s more mechanical typing, copying, and pasting are going to disappear. So the last time you were on the show, I don’t think there was a lot of hype around RPA. I was into it because I’m fascinated by the idea of computers using computers, and when you were on the show in 2022 was sort of the height of that. You were riding high. This is why you said you needed humility. The idea was that instead of upgrading a lot of old computer systems, we would abstract them away with UiPath technology, build new interfaces, and that would allow all kinds of flexibility. That was a big idea. I think that has changed. In the AI age, we see a lot of companies promising agentic capabilities. We see a lot of companies saying that they’ll move even farther up the stack, all the way up to decision-making. But when I look back on that conversation and everything that’s happened since, the thing that gets me is that robotic process automation, the idea that you have some old hospital building’s system and UiPath will build a modern way to use it, is deterministic. You knew where all the buttons in that software were, you could program your way through them. Maybe you needed some machine learning to understand the interfaces better or to make it less brittle, but you knew what the inputs and the outputs were. RPA knows the path between those things. AI is totally not deterministic. The robot’s going to go do something. Is there a connection between the software you were building, the RPA you are selling, and the agentic capabilities you want to build? Because it seems like there’s a fundamental technology shift that has to happen there. I think you expressed the essence of what we are building when you say deterministic and non-deterministic. These are exactly the terms I use when I am explaining how robots and AI should interact. Look, LLMs are not meant to do deterministic tasks. If you ask an LLM to multiply two numbers, it cannot figure out how to multiply two numbers because it’s not statistical matching. What it would do best is understand, “Ah, I’m required to multiply two numbers. I have a tool that knows how to multiply two numbers, so I will call a tool and I will get the precise answer.” This is how they work. They don’t have the intelligence inside them because it’s a non-deterministic tool. It’s not meant to do a series of deterministic steps. In the same way, you can think of transactional work that produces side effects in enterprise systems. It should be deterministic. You cannot have a 95 percent chance of succeeding a payment transaction. It has to be 100 percent, and if there is an exception, people should be notified. It cannot be “maybe.” Our robots offer this fully deterministic way to do transactions across multiple systems, transactions that create effects on these systems. With LLMs and with technology like OpenAI’s Operator or “computer use” from Anthropic — actually we are users, and we work closely with both of these companies to integrate their technology — you can complement what RPA is doing on parts of the process that you couldn’t automate before. If I have a process that relies on doing research… like if I’m traveling, I want to create a travel agent with AI. This travel agent will do research on available flights and across a multitude of airlines. It’s no big harm if I miss one flight option. So I can have a non-deterministic tool, go and extract the information, then an agent can make some decisions. It can present to the user, “These are available flights.” But then when I book a flight, I have to use something deterministic. When the money transacts, money changes hands. Basically we can have the best of both worlds. We can extend the reach of deterministic with non-deterministic while accepting the risks of non-deterministic. And there are domains like research or testing an application when we can take more risks. It makes sense. It depends on your level of risk you can accept. It makes sense to me. I see your competitors and your partners, like OpenAI and Anthropic, and they’ve made their entire technology bet on agentic AI. I assume that their plan is for that to get good enough to do everything. Your approach is that there’s some stuff that traditional RPA, the traditional deterministic computer, needs to do, and that can be layered with an LLM or an AI system. I’m just wondering what the intersection point is. Will there ever be an intersection point when OpenAI says, “Operator can do it all,” and that presents some kind of paradigm shift for your business? I am absolutely sure that the intersection point is when you can define a task in a deterministic way and know the steps. There is really no point in having an LLM that does this task all the time to rediscover how to do it or to think about every step because it’s impossible to get to 100 percent accuracy. We are testing these LLMs for simple form filling. They can work very well, but think about it. You need to run it hundreds, or even thousands of times to get to 100 percent accuracy. This is not what the technology is for. What I am saying is that LLMs will eventually create routines that can work 100 percent accurately. But the idea that LLMs will discover a process every time like you would when you see an application or a book for the first time in your life… humans don’t work like this. We learn. You learn an application, and then if you watch yourself, most of the things you’ll do will be on autopilot. We’ve had other companies come on the show and talk about their agentic software approaches. Actually, they were facsimiles of the agentic software they wanted to build. So, Rabbit came on the show, and its first version of the Rabbit R1 was running testing software in the background. You would ask for a song on Spotify, and it would just click around on the Spotify website in the cloud and then stream the song to you. Its claim was that it actually did build the agent, but it needed to build the first version and have proof of concept. But the deterministic system, in one very real way, can act like the thing people want from the AI system. It can almost do it and then it’s brittle, but the AI can make it less brittle by reacting to change or an unexpected outcome. How do you merge those things together? How do you decide which system to use? Because that seems like the technology problem of the moment. The way we are seeing the adoption of combined agentic AI and automation is by putting a workflow technology on top of it. Our agents are more like data-in, action-out agents — not necessarily conversational agents. We focus on delivering enterprise agents that work in the context of an enterprise process. So to us, the critical piece is this orchestration part. Let’s say you have a loan agent that has to approve some loans. A workflow is triggered when the loan application is received. So, you have an enterprise workflow. Then, that workflow will first send the application to a reading agent that is specialized in extracting the information from the application. Then, I can send it to a human user to verify something basic if I’m not confident enough in what I extracted. It can be a more junior person that does this verification. Then, the workflow will send it to an agent that will make loan recommendations. That agent can start to call tools like, “Get this person’s credit score.” So this tool is definitely something deterministic. It’s either an API to a credit score agency or you can use an RPA bot. That is clearly deterministic. You are not going to use something like OpenAI’s Operator to just figure out a guy’s credit score. There is absolutely no point. It’s taking too much time and it’s not reliable. Already you see it’s a combination. The workflow knows how to direct the fixed paths of a process, and then agents are capable of making recommendations and calling tools that will give the context. Then, after the agent makes a recommendation to approve this loan, it will go to a human user. The workflow will create a task, a human user will get it in their inbox asking them to approve or not. They press a button and approve. The workflow will go back maybe to the last agent and say, “Please compose a nice acceptance message particular to this client.” It’s a simplistic view, but this is how we believe the world and enterprise customers will adopt agents. Also, they need to have some confidence in the system. You said we are talking about this black box system, a swarm of agents that do their magic and sometimes they make mistakes. Until you accept it, you need to have confidence and you need to see the work. Everybody is more confident when they see the workflow. They can say, “Look, if that happens, it goes like this. If that happens, it goes like this.” So you can trace it, you can understand it, you can reason with it. One of my takes on the interaction between humans and AI is that for a long time we have to speak the same language. Even when you create an application or an automation, AI actually creates code. AI can eventually work directly with machine code. They don’t have to create Python code, but it’s important that AI creates Python code because humans can reason, change, and accept it. It’s going to be the same in automation applications. AI will use existing platforms, will create artifacts on top of those existing platforms, and people will validate what’s going on there. On the consumer side, the value of the existing platforms is, I think, under enormous threat. So I call this the “DoorDash problem” on the consumer side. We just had Amazon’s Panos Panay on, and it’s rolling out a new version of Alexa. You’re going to be able to say, “Alexa, buy me a sandwich,” and it will just get DoorDash to send you a sandwich. This is a huge problem for DoorDash. Its margins are under significant pressure if their interface gets commoditized in that way. We’re going to have the CEO of DoorDash on the show eventually and I’ll ask him this question. but I can abstractly see the pressure on some of these systems that are going to get commoditized by new kinds of interfaces. The classic RPA truly depended on those systems existing. You needed the existing loan system that nobody wanted to upgrade so you could build the RPA interface on top of it. You need the credit score interface that might not have a great API, but you can use RPA to go get it from their website. AI changes that because it’s coming to all of those systems as well. There’s some part of the AI industry that’s chasing all of those things at once, not just building this orchestration layer. What do you think about the long-term longevity of those systems? I look on the consumer side and I say, “Oh, this is a big problem for DoorDash. This is a big problem for Uber.” I don’t know exactly how it works on the enterprise side. We’ll see how it evolves. The fact that we still have a lot of mainframes, and our RPA touches a lot of mainframes, shows that the changing of enterprise systems is much more difficult than in the consumer space. If you look at complex enterprise applications like Workday and SAP, I can see people adding a nice layer of voice on top that’s AI-powered. You know, “Change my vacation responder to this.” But the tablet and mobile phone didn’t make the keyboard or mouse obsolete. I think they will still have to coexist. Many people can work on user interfaces faster with a keyboard than with voice, but voice is going to become a good way to interact with applications. When you need to absorb a lot of information simultaneously, you need the user interface. In many cases, you’ll still need to interact with it. It’s easier than telling the AI, “Please press the okay button.” I will just go and click the button. It’s easier and it’s faster. They have to coexist. I was thinking about the DoorDash problem. You’re basically saying that Amazon can build its own DoorDash. If it can control the interface with the client, it doesn’t matter who delivers in the end because– It’s not that they will build their own DoorDash. It’s that DoorDash’s opportunities to make additional revenue will go away. It won’t be able to upsell, won’t be able to do deals, won’t be able to have exclusives. The interface will be commoditized and it will just become a service provider with Amazon or whoever’s AI agent being in control of the business. You see that for a lot of these ideas. You need an ecosystem of service providers for the agent to go and address, and that crushes the margins of the service providers. It’s possible. I think I see it in the consumer space. You see the back and forth. There’s some amount of, “We don’t want you here. We’re going to block your agents from using our services.” That is already happening on the consumer side. There’s some amount of dealmaking. Then on the enterprise side, it seems like there’s going to be a lot of dealmaking where maybe instead of API access, we’re allowing agentic access or RPA access because the data is what’s valuable there. To a certain extent, we had the same problem with RPA. Think about the fact that most enterprise or SaaS software was licensed by user seats. With RPA, you needed far fewer user seats. You can have one seat that does the job of hundreds of seats. They found ways to kind of prevent this and create special service accounts to deal with it. Some vendors do not allow it. I’m sure they will find some ways to deal with it because how can Alexa order if DoorDash doesn’t want to receive the order? There has to be something in it for both of them. I think that’s an enormous technical challenge, and the business challenge is even harder. You have to get a lot of people to agree to fundamentally restructure their businesses in order for any of this to work. Again, on the enterprise side, there’s more dealmaking. You have some instincts, some history, some moves to say, “Okay, here’s how we’re going to structure access to the data.” I have no idea how it’ll play out on the consumer side. You mentioned a thing about LLMs not having memory, having to rethink the workflow every single time. That’s true. I think the AI companies are working on that. But they’re also pushing the idea of reasoning, that now we’re going to layer LLM approaches over and over again into a simulacrum of human reasoning. I don’t know if that’s correct. They say they can do it. Is that having an impact on what you’re doing? Can you say, “Here’s the decision, here’s the process by which a decision is made”? The way we are seeing the reasoning part is that it’s more helpful, in our world, for creating automations. We have this Copilot-type of technology where you describe a process and it can create the artifact to execute the process. The smarter an LLM is, the closer to reality the creation gets and the developer has to change it less. So in a way, it’s like creating code, if you want. It’s the same thing. The smarter LLMs will create better code, but that code is still going to be executed by hyperscalers. It’s not LLMs that do that. Think about it. Maybe LLMs will do everything. Why would they generate code at all? You mentioned hyperscalers. One of the things that I’ve been thinking about a lot is the amount of investment the hyperscalers are doing just to buy Nvidia chips, to build data centers, or to invest in nuclear fusion against the promise that there will be this much demand for AI services. They have to make money doing this somehow. It’s unclear how the bleeding edge, frontier AI companies are going to make money. I don’t know how OpenAI will ever make a dollar. I don’t know how Anthropic will ever make a dollar except by raising more money, which they’re very good at. That’s on a long-term plan. You’re a public company. You have to make the money. You have to buy the tokens, you have to use them, you have to build the products, you have to charge your market price. Are the rates we’re at now sustainable? I don’t know if it’s sustainable or not for them, but if I were them, I would do the same. What if this is indeed the biggest revolution of our time? What if all of these GPUs and AI agents will take over the world and I am not there? But I’m saying you’ve got to charge your customer some price for the use of an AI tool. You’re not running all of your own models. You’re partnered with some of these companies. You’re buying some of their capacity. They’re, in turn, buying capacity from Azure, AWS, or whatever they’re running on. All of these companies need a margin and some of their margins are negative. OpenAI loses money on inference right now, but it’s selling that capacity to you. At some point, they’re going to turn the knob and say, “We’ve got to make money.” They’re going to raise prices on you, and you’ll have to pass that cost to your actual customers who are actual businesses trying to automate their companies and raise their own margins. When will it become too expensive? That seems like the correction that’s coming. You’re going to say, “Okay, OpenAI raised our prices. UiPath has raised its prices,” and some customers are going to say no. If we look at through our lens of the processes we automate, what’s the alternative at this point? Using human labor? I think even if OpenAI increases prices, I still don’t think humans can compete with AI plus automation when it is possible. And long term, the pricing will go down and it’s a lot of competition for the business. I’m not really concerned about this aspect. Have you structured your technology so that you can swap between AI providers? Are you tied to OpenAI, Anthropic, or is that easily modular? No, not at all. We actually offer our customers a piece of technology that we call AI Trust Layer, where they can switch between different providers or bring their own on-prem model if they want. You just bought a company called Peak, which is another AI provider. Why make that bet? Why bring in technology? We want to get into vertical agents. Peak is a pricing and inventory agent, and it has really solid experience in delivering these dedicated solutions based on agentic AI, and we want to extend that. Of course, we’ll integrate it first into our platform, but we want to come out with more dedicated agents. It makes the entire go-to-market easier. We want it to work a bit like a locomotive for the entire platform because it can create more demand for automation. How does that technology plug into your existing stack? I understand it has markets you might not have or that you want to get bigger in, but ideally you buy a company and what you’re going to do is sell its existing markets more of your tools. Definitely. That was on our mind. I think we have really good synergies in our go-to-market, and we can really accelerate its go-to-market, particularly in the manufacturing industries. We have very solid manufacturing practices in the US, Germany, and Japan. Do you think there’s an opportunity for you to commoditize the AI tools themselves? I just keep thinking about this. You have your AI Trust Layer, you have your own vertical systems that you’re buying that you might deploy. At some point, what matters to companies is the business outcome, not that they have an OpenAI partnership. It feels like the big AI companies are trying to be everything to everyone, and you’re trying to specialize. Do you think at some point you’re going to say, “What we deliver are business outcomes and the technology doesn’t actually matter”? I think that generative AI is going through this phase. Initially, it was a nice toy. Everybody put budgets to experiment with it, and now we are moving toward the phase where people really want outcomes. Initially, they all used OpenAI, and our strategy was to use OpenAI because it’s the best. If you want to make a proof of concept, why would you use something different? But as you go and you specialize it for different types of industries and processes, you can choose whatever is more appropriate. We look at everything from DeepSeek, Llama, to Anthropic. We use all of them in different parts of the business. In the end, we are more of an AI engineering company, and our job is to build nice products that deliver value for customers. Behind the scenes, we use whatever LLMs are best for a particular scenario. I actually want to ask you about DeepSeek. Was that as shocking of a moment for you? The industry reacted to the idea that you could run the model much more cheaply very harshly — very harshly. Did you see that and say, “This will bring my cost down. This is also a revolution”? Selfishly, for UiPath, any open-source capable model is a great thing for us and for our customers. My belief is that these dedicated agents will require a combination of fine-tuning and really good prompts. So, if you can have a great model that you can fine-tune and combine with good prompts, that will provide the highest value and the cheapest price. We find you can actually distill it into a smaller model that works very well for a particular domain. Where do you see the biggest growth for traditional RPA, for AI, and for the hybrid of AI and RPA? RPA is an established industry right now that grows in the low double-digits. The demand that we are seeing right now for our agentic technology, I have never seen in the RPA world. It really opens all the doors. We get a seat at the table where we are not used to being from the automation perspective. People are really excited about this idea of agentic automation. They get it. The value proposition is kind of simple for us. I can go to my clients and tell them, “Guys, where did you deploy robots? How are people interacting with the robots today? Why are we not reducing the work of people, deploying agents, and creating an enterprise workflow that will connect agents with people and robots?” It’s a no-brainer proposition. It resonates, it’s simple, it creates a lot of excitement. I want to tell you about my favorite Slack room at Vox Media and get your reaction to it. We have a room called Finance Support, and in this room, people ask a Slack robot to do stuff: file invoices, give receipts, all this stuff. I look at this room once a week, and it cracks me up every time. I literally fall over and giggle every time because the people who are new to this room type full sentences: “Hi, I need help with this receipt. Can you itemize this thing? I’ve got a flight.” The people who are repeat users have discovered that they just need to scream nouns at a robot. So they just show up and they just say the word “expenses,” and all of this is in one stack. There are people who are very polite and then people who are just yelling nouns at a robot. You can see this secondary language of human-machine interaction developing: “I’m just going to say keywords to the robot because that’s all it needs from me.” I look at that and I say, “Oh, that’s a revolution.” First of all, it’s very funny. But this is a revolution in business. You’re going to have some people who are just saying keywords in Slack to get things done for their business to an agent that might just go off and do it, and then you have the people who are used to all of the niceties of business fluffing up their communication. At some point, you’re just going to have robots saying nouns to each other instead of using an API. In many ways, that’s what RPA was. You’re just using the human interface instead of an API. Do you see all of business changing around this as clearly as I do when I look at this Slack room? Yeah, and even for RPA, this is true. Many people are using RPA by creating a Slack channel that connects directly with a robot that does something. AI just extends the same idea. To me, it’s kind of fascinating how we communicate with bots. I discovered myself — well, maybe it’s just an impression — but if I say, “please,” I think that LLMs come back with better responses. [Laughs] Here’s something I also worry about. You’re the CEO. You get a lot of emails, you send a lot of emails. Do you ever worry about the loop where you’re responding to an email that was written by AI with another email that’s written by AI and suddenly everyone’s just pushing the summarize button and no one’s actually talking? I personally write my emails because everybody in the company and clients knows my own tone and my broken English. So I cannot use LLMs. But yes, I’ve seen many instances where it looks like LLMs are talking to each other. You’re the automation vendor. LLMs talking to each other — there’s something hollow there, right? Is that something you want to achieve with your products, or is it something you’re trying to avoid? I think to a certain extent we want to achieve that with our product. We want to facilitate agents talking to each other, but in a more controlled environment. Daniel, you’ve given us so much time. You’re going to have to come back. I feel like I could just talk about the philosophical repercussions of all of these systems with you for many more hours, but you’ve given us so much time.

April 07, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Rocket Lab and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until April 28, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

If you're looking for a job, we know things feel grim. White-collar hiring has slowed, and many people are clinging to their jobs even if they're unhappy. While US job growth beat forecasts in March, unemployment ticked up too, and the competition for open roles remains fierce. With job applications piling up and layoffs, budget cuts, and economic uncertainty haunting both people and businesses, a job market that feels "meh" could soon get a lot worse. At Business Insider, we're constantly studying the changing workplace and collecting the most up-to-date expert advice for job-seekers. We've tapped HR managers, recruiters, career coaches, and executives for their best advice on everything from crafting a standout resumé to networking your way to a final offer. To help you navigate your job search successfully, we've also talked to dozens of non-experts — regular people who've managed to break through and land offers — and asked them to share their happy endings and hard-won wisdom. Below you will find a list of the top new rules for job-seekers in 2025 from BI correspondent Aki Ito and a career coach's advice for overcoming a career setback. An ex-VP of HR at Microsoft who's watched people network their way to jobs for years shared the tried-and-true approaches he's witnessed. An ex-Amazon VP who's viewed 10,000-plus résumés in his career revealed the most common mistakes he's seen and how to fix them. A tech worker who landed six-figure roles at Meta and Google by finding the "third door" shared his trick for breaking into companies, along with the exact résumé he uses. Now more than ever, it's imperative for job-seekers to stand out from the pack in order to land their next role. Here's how experts told us job seekers can do just that.
