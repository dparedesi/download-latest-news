Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty advanced for the fourth straight session on Friday, supported by buying in blue-chips ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, amid fresh foreign fund inflows. A strengthening rupee against the US dollar and softening crude oil prices in international markets also boosted investor confidence, according to traders. Equity indices rise on blue-chip buying, foreign fund inflows, and positive global cues, boosting investor confidence. The rupee rose 24 paise to close at 85.48 (provisional) against the greenback on Friday on the back of strong FII inflows and firm domestic equity markets. Rupee strengthens against dollar on FII inflows and equity market boost, despite crude oil price uptrend. Today, the Indian stock market closed with a positive bias, reflecting investor optimism amid easing global tensions and favourable domestic cues. The BSE Sensex ended higher by approximately 303 points, closing around 84,058, while the NSE Nifty50 gained about 88 points to settle near 25,637. The market’s upside momentum was primarily driven by strong performances in sectors such as Oil & Gas, PSU Banks, with Nifty Oil & Gas index rising over 0.5%. The positive close was supported by hopes of a potential relaxation in US tariff deadlines, improved global market sentiments, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which boosted risk appetite among investors. Additionally, the Indian rupee strengthened against the dollar, trading at around 85.51, further aiding market sentiment. Domestic factors such as robust IPO subscription rates, including HDB Financial Services and Sambhv Steel Tubes, also indicated sustained investor interest. DBS Bank India Ltd (DBIL) has waived prepayment and foreclosure charges for all Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) borrowers registered with UDYAM, making it easier for businesses to access credit and manage cash flow. Announced on MSME Day, this move reflects the bank’s continued commitment to supporting India’s MSMEs. The waiver is effective going forward and applies to both new and existing active borrowers. This proactive step aims to enhance borrower flexibility and aligns with regulatory guidance focused on improving transparency in lending. It also addresses a persistent challenge faced by many MSMEs — where foreclosure charges have often deterred early repayment or refinancing, restricting their ability to optimise cash flow management. Commenting on the development, Sudarshan Chari, Managing Director, and Head – SME Banking, DBS Bank India, said, “Access to flexible and affordable credit remains a critical need for micro, small and medium enterprises. By waiving prepayment and foreclosure charges, we are addressing a common challenge that often limits financial agility. This change enables businesses to repay loans early without penalty and reallocate funds towards immediate priorities or critical areas like inventory, technology, and expansion. It aligns with our broader efforts to support MSMEs with need-based solutions that strengthen their resilience and unlock long-term growth.” Delhivery shares traded flat on the BSE at ₹382.65.

Kinara Capital, a leading fintech driving MSME financial inclusion, today released its fourth edition of MSME Insights, signaling strong optimism and increased formalization in the MSME sector. MSME entrepreneurs are confident about their near-term business growth prospects. According to the latest MSME Insights, 81% of the surveyed MSMEs expect their business revenue to increase within the next 1-2 years. Of these, 34% anticipate a revenue growth of more than 15% in their businesses. Additionally, MSMEs are embracing formalization, with 51.7% of the surveyed reporting that they are now GST-registered. The fourth edition of MSME Insights is based on an extensive multilingual survey of 9,314 MSMEs from Manufacturing, Trading, and Services sectors conducted across Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The MSME Insights is a comprehensive data analysis of current trends of micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) based on firsthand input from business owners. MSME Insights also delved into the behavioral patterns within the MSME sector and the analysis uncovered a striking pattern across all sectors. MSMEs still depend significantly on cash transactions, even when not accounting for UPI usage. Over 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs stated that between 25%-100% of their business transactions are conducted with actual cash—underscoring the need for deeper digitization efforts across the sector. Sharing her perspective, Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital, said, “On the occasion of World MSME Day, it is encouraging to witness the strong optimism shared by India’s MSMEs. The fact that 81% of respondents in our recent MSME Insights survey expressed confidence in their growth prospects speaks volumes about the sector’s resilience and ambition. This optimism is rooted in improved access to formal credit, which enables entrepreneurs to focus on expansion. However, the sector’s continued reliance on cash transactions highlights the need to accelerate digitization. Embracing digital payments can enhance financial transparency and significantly boost access to formal credit. Ultimately, digitization holds the key to reaching underserved MSMEs and closing India’s ₹30 lakh crore credit gap.” KEY FINDINGS FROM KINARA CAPITAL’S MSME INSIGHTS, FOURTH EDITION ● MSMEs are upbeat about their business growth : More than 81% of the respondents have indicated that they are expecting varying degrees of growth in their revenue. Of these, 47% of the respondents expect their revenue to witness a 5%-15% growth, 26.1% anticipate a growth of 15%-25% and 7.9% are optimistic of more than 25% growth in revenue. Only a small proportion, i.e., 1.1% foresee no growth. ●Cash is King for MSMEs : Overall, 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs reported relying on cash (excluding UPI) for 25%-to-100% of their business transactions. While only 7.4% of the MSME respondents relied on cash for more than 75% of their business transactions, 30.5% depended on cash for 50%-to-75% of their business transactions. This outcome indicates that a shift to digital payments, though underway, is far from reaching its full potential. ●Formalization is on an Upswing : MSMEs are increasingly recognizing the benefits of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance. According to the survey, 51.7% of respondents are GST-registered and file returns regularly. Of these, 29.4% expressed interest in GST-linked loan products that offer better interest rates or flexible tenures. Regular GST filings not only reflect consistent business activity but also provide a verifiable financial history that enhances credit eligibility. Additionally, GST registration reduces the overall tax burden through input tax credits and offers MSMEs the ease of doing business across state lines with a unified tax structure. SBI General Insurance, one of India’s leading general insurance providers, has partnered with Starfin India, a subsidiary of BLS E-Services, to introduce an innovative Hospital Daily Cash Benefit Plan for low-income families. Hospitalization costs can significantly impact savings due to the potentially high expenses associated with treatment, medication, and recovery. This financial stress is often compounded by income loss and out-of-pocket expenses such as travel, medication, and attendant care. Under this plan the policyholders will receive a fixed daily cash benefit during hospital stays due to illness or accidents, helping reduce financial stress during challenging times. It will also include coverage for accidental death and partial disability, offering added protection and peace of mind to insured individuals. Commenting on the collaboration, Priya Kumar, Business Head - Emerging Business Lines at SBI General Insurance said, “Access to timely financial support during hospitalisation can make a significant difference for vulnerable families. Our collaboration with Starfin India is timely due to IRDAI’s objective of ensuring timely settlement of genuine claims, preventing fraud, and establishing effective grievance redressal mechanisms and also strengthening the financial resilience of underserved communities creating a meaningful impact at the time of need.” HDFC Bank subsidiary HDB Financial Services launches IPO, HDB Financial Services IPO GMP Day 3 Live Updates: India’s largest NBFC public issue of HDFC Bank’s subsidiary, HDB Financial Services, received a strong response, as the mega offer was subscribed fully on Day 2 itself.

Source: Reuters 1.January 2025: FIIs recorded significant outflows of ₹78,000 crore, one of the highest monthly sell-offs, driven by global factors like high US interest rates and disappointing Q2 FY25 earnings in India. 2.February 2025: Outflows continued at ₹23,000 crore, with heavy selling in sectors like banking, financial services, consumer goods, and automobiles. However, some FII buying was noted in telecom (₹5,600 crore, largely due to Bharti Airtel’s stake sale), IT, specialty chemicals, and textiles. March 2025: FIIs turned net buyers on specific days, with a notable single-day purchase of ₹6,065.78 crore on April 15, marking the third-largest single-day buying in 2025 (after ₹11,111.25 crore on March 27 and ₹7,470.36 crore on March 21). However, early March data suggested outflows exceeding ₹20,000 crore. Overall, FIIs were net buyers of ₹31,784 crore in gross purchases against ₹20,673 crore in sales on March 27. April 2025: FIIs showed renewed interest, with inflows of over $1.9 billion (≈₹15,960 crore) between April 15 and 21, and an additional ₹1,290 crore on April 22. This marked a shift after a month of heavy selling. May 2025: FIIs were net buyers on specific days, e.g., ₹3,794.52 crore on May 6, but the monthly net flow data is incomplete. June 2025: 🔸FII activity showed mixed trends, from June 17, FIIs net bought ₹1,482.77 crore. 🔸On June 18, FIIs net bought ₹945 crore. 🔸On June 19, FIIs net bought ₹934.62 crore. 🔸On June 20, FIIs net bought ₹7,940.70 crore. 🔸On June 24, FIIs net sold ₹5,266.01 crore. 🔸On June 26, FIIs net bought ₹12,594.38 crore (provisional data).

Title: Salesforce chief Marc Benioff says AI now does up to half of all the work at his company

UPDATED 19:46 EDT / JUNE 26 2025 by Mike Wheatley Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff says his company is doubling down on the use of artificial intelligence, using the technology to automate dozens of workloads that were, until recently, done by humans. In an interview with Bloomberg, Benioff (pictured) said AI agents are now performing as much as 30% to 50% of all the work at his company. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher-value work,” Benioff said. The problem for some Salesforce employees is that they’ll need to find another employer who’s willing to pay them to perform that higher-value work. Earlier this year, the company announced it’s laying off about 1,000 of its staff. Although it has also announced plans to hire another 1,000, these new employees will be focused on selling its Agentforce technology. What that means is that those new workers will be tasked with urging other companies to adopt AI that can automate work normally done by humans, potentially encouraging them to replace some of their own employees. It’s a worrying trend that seems to be catching on. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a letter to employees where he discussed the company’s increased adoption of generative AI tools and admitted that it will likely need “fewer people” in future than it currently employs. The rise of AI comes at a time when technology companies are looking for new ways to try and cut costs and boost efficiencies, and many have already announced plans to achieve that by sacrificing human workers. For instance, Microsoft Corp. had already cut more than 6,000 jobs in May and is now reportedly undergoing a second round of layoffs while investing more in AI, according to Fast Company. Google LLC has also reportedly trimmed people from various departments. The website Layoffs.fyi says more than 63,000 jobs have disappeared in the tech industry so far this year, and there are growing reasons to think AI is at least partly responsible for this trend. In his latest newsletter, Brian Merchant, author of “Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech,” writes that he has spoken with dozens of tech industry workers who have been affected by the adoption of AI. He claims that the technology is rapidly reshaping Silicon Valley’s workforces. According to Merchant, an employee at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. told him that his company’s recent round of layoffs saw many new hires booted out and replaced with AI, despite saying publicly it was about cutting underperforming staff. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week,” the employee said. An employee at Dropbox Inc. made similar claims about his employer, saying that during its recent round of layoffs, the entire team focused on improving the reliability of its products was let go in favor of AI tools that can automate this work. Benioff told Bloomberg that the workforce is now undergoing a “digital labor revolution” and said his company’s AI agents can perform work with an accuracy of about 93%. “It’s pretty good, but it’s not realistic to hit 100%,” Benioff said, pointing out that other companies are at “much lower levels because they don’t have as much data and metadata.” Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Monster and CareerBuilder, once popular with job seekers, file for bankruptcy

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 3:14:47 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Monster and CareerBuilder, once two of the most popular websites for job seekers at the height of the dot-com era, have filed for bankruptcy. The two sites, which merged last year to become one entity named Monster + CareerBuilder, voluntary filed for Chapter 11 Tuesday, announcing that the company is selling various parts of its businesses to several buyers as part of a court-supervised process, a press release said. Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

Oh, is that why Military.com is a leftist rag? Same here. Those websites, ALL job seeker websites that I tried, were a waste of time, and I tried many. I got a job once through Monster, but it was years ago when they didn’t suck. CareerBuilder’s always been a clown show - I’m surprised they lasted this long. Monster seemed to copy off them for inspiration, so it was no surprise people stopped using Monster. It’s unfortunate that we’re basically left with LinkedIn and Indeed. I loathe what LinkedIn has become. Kind of ambivalent about Indeed. Seems like this should be a relatively easy problem to solve - people looking for jobs, companies looking for people - yet it always seems to go south and get hijacked into multiple levels of scam, grift and incompetence. Thank you. I thought it was just me. I landed 5 or 6 jobs on job boards. “...Same here. Those websites, ALL job seeker websites that I tried, were a waste of time, and I tried many...” Oh, I should perhaps clarify. While it is “indeed” true that I have never found so much as ONE single, paying job off of any of those sites, that’s not to say that I never got any contacts. However, the ONLY contacts I got were from the types of outfits, where I would get a call from a secretary, who would start with things such as: “Hello, I am from Dacoit & Scoundrel Associates, and wanted to inform you that Mr. McCartney has reviewed your CV, and is very interested in meeting with you to discuss it further...” (deliberately vague for about three more sentences as she’s in the process of “setting up an appointment”, and pushing for further personal details. Then she sets us up the bomb: “When you come to your appointment, please bring a $2,500 certified cheque...” From my end: “Uhmmmmm...” (awkward pause because I want to at least TRY to be diplomatic, but I ultimately fail): “...only twenty-five hundred, huh? Yeah, honey, I’ll get right on that.” I found the job I have had for the past 15 years on Career Builder. Got laid off on a Monday and was at my new job on Wednesday. Worked out well. I haven’t messed with those two websites in forever. LinkedIn is the only place I go, though I am not actively looking for work at this time.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Radio broadcaster and podcast company Audacy is shuttering Pineapple Street Studios, which had produced original audio shows and companion podcasts for TV shows like “House of the Dragon,” “Severance” and “The Last of Us.” With the shutdown of Pineapple Street, nearly 30 employees are being laid off, according to sources familiar with the company. Audacy, previously known as Entercom Communications, had acquired Pineapple Street for a reported $18 million in 2019. Related Stories Lalo Schifrin, Prolific Film Composer Who Wrote 'Mission: Impossible' Theme, Dies at 93 An Audacy spokesperson said in a statement, “This difficult decision aligns our resources with our core strengths and the most promising growth areas for our podcasting business. We’re sorry to say goodbye to talented colleagues and are grateful for their contributions.” Popular on Variety Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management. In March, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions. Pineapple’s shows for TV networks included official podcasts for HBO and HBO Max series “And Just Like That…,” “Chernobyl,” “Dune: Prophecy,” “Hacks,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” Its companion shows for Apple TV+ include podcasts for “Foundation” and “Severance.” According to its website, Pineapple also sold multiple originals for TV and film development, including “Wind of Change” to Hulu, “Missing Richard Simmons” to Amazon Studios, “Heaven’s Gate” to HBO Max and “The Clearing” to Chernin Entertainment. Audacy plans to continue producing podcasts in association with other media companies. Pineapple Street had produced the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s official “Severance” podcast. Going forward, that is now being produced by Audacy Podcasts, in partnership with Red Hour and Great Scott. Five new episodes of “The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller & Adam Scott” will be released weekly on Thursdays beginning June 26, available across all podcast platforms. In addition, a set of new episodes is slated to be released in the fall of 2025. According to the Pineapple Street Studios site, the company was founded in 2016 by Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky. The studio has staff based in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In March, Audacy named Kelli Turner its permanent president and CEO while also announcing the departure of four top execs. The shutdown of Pineapple Street was first reported by Bloomberg. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus for BAR, please visithttps://www.graniteshares.com/Documents/25/Prospectus-GraniteShares-Gold-Trust.pdf To obtain a prospectus for PLTM, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/gwrbh3ah/pltm_prospectus.pdf To obtain a prospectus for COMB, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/4crf2x4e/graniteshares-etf-trust-comb-summary-prospectus.pdf Except as described above regarding the liquidation of the ETFs, shares of the Funds may be sold during trading hours on the exchange through any brokerage account, shares are not individually redeemable, and shares may only be redeemed directly from a Fund by Authorized Participants. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.

The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time.

Title: Why AI Illiterate Directors Are The New Liability For Boards Today
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenwolfepereira/2025/06/26/why-ai-illiterate-directors-are-the-new-liability-for-boards-today/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T21:02:01Z
Full Content:
BySteven Wolfe Pereira BySteven Wolfe Pereira, Contributor. Twenty-three years after Sarbanes-Oxley mandated financial experts on audit committees, boards face an even more transformative moment. But unlike the post-Enron era when adding one qualified financial expert sufficed, the AI revolution demands something far more radical: every director must become AI literate, or risk becoming a liability in the intelligence age. I just came back for the Stanford Directors’ College, the premier executive education program for directors and senior executives of publicly traded firms. Now in its thirtieth year, this year’s speakers included Reed Hastings, (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic), Michael Sentonas (President, Crowdstrike), Maggie Wilderotter (Chairman, Docusign; Director, Costco, Fortinet and Sana Biotechnology), John Donahoe (Former CEO, Nike, ServiceNow, and eBay; Former Chairman, PayPal) and Condoleezza Rice (Director, Hoover Institution; Former U.S. Secretary of State). Organized by Stanford Law Professor Joseph Grundfest and the Co-Executive Director of Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance Amanda Packel, the program addresses a broad range of problems that confront modern boards. The topics are extensive, including the board’s role in setting business strategy, CEO and board succession, crisis management, techniques for controlling legal liability, challenges posed by activist investors, boardroom dynamics, international trade issues, the global economy, and cybersecurity threats. However, the topic that everyone wanted to discuss was AI. Joseph A. Grundfest, (Co-Director, Stanford Directors’ College; W.A. Franke Professor of Law and ... More Business, Emeritus, Stanford Law School; Senior Faculty, Rock Center for Corporate Governance), interviews the AI-savvy Reed Hastings (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic) at the 2025 Stanford Directors' College. The stakes couldn’t be higher. While traditional boards debate AI risks in quarterly meetings, a new breed of AI-first competitors operates at algorithmic speed. Consider Cursor, which reached $500 million in annual recurring revenue with just 60 employees, or Cognition Labs, valued at $4 billion with only 10 people. These aren’t just “unicorns”, they’re the harbingers of a fundamental shift in how AI-first businesses operate. After Enron’s collapse, the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) act required boards to include at least one "qualified financial expert" who understood GAAP, financial statements, and internal controls. Companies either complied or publicly explained why they lacked such expertise—a powerful mechanism that transformed board composition within five years. Today’s AI challenge dwarfs that financial literacy mandate. Unlike accounting expertise that could be compartmentalized to audit committees, AI permeates every business function. When algorithms make thousands of decisions daily across marketing, operations, HR, and customer service, delegating oversight to a single "tech expert" becomes not just inadequate but dangerous. The data reveals a governance crisis in motion. According to ISS analysis, only 31% of S&P 500 companies disclosed any board oversight of AI in 2024 and a mere 11% reported explicit full board or committee oversight. This despite an 84% year-over-year increase in such disclosures, suggesting boards are scrambling to catch up. Institutional investors have moved from encouragement to enforcement. BlackRock’s 2025 proxy voting guidelines emphasize board composition must reflect necessary "experiences, perspectives, and skillsets," with explicit warnings about voting against directors at companies that are "outliers compared to market norms." Vanguard and State Street have issued similar guidance, while Glass Lewis added a new AI governance section to its 2025 policies. Large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, have varying policies ... More on board oversight of material risks and are now looking at AI governance. The enforcement mechanism? Universal proxy cards, mandatory since September 2022, enable surgical strikes against individual directors. Activists launched 243 campaigns in 2024 (the highest total since 2018’s record of 249 campaigns), with technology sector campaigns up 15.9% year-over-year. Boards with "skills gaps related to areas where the company is underperforming" face the highest vulnerability - and nothing screams skills gap louder than AI illiteracy while competitors automate core functions. Consider what happened in 2024: 27 CEOs resigned due to activist pressure, up from 24 in 2023 and well above the four-year average of 16. The percentage of S&P 500 CEO resignations linked to activist activity has tripled since 2020. The message is clear: governance failures have consequences, and AI governance represents the next frontier for activist campaigns. Here’s the scenario keeping forward-thinking directors awake: while your board debates whether to form an AI committee, a three-person startup with 100+ AI agents is systematically capturing your market share. This isn’t hyperbole. In legal services, AI achieves 100x productivity gains, reducing document review from 16 hours to 3-4 minutes. Harvey AI raised $300 million at a $3 billion valuation, while Crosby promises contract review in under an hour. In software development, companies report 60% faster cycle times and 50% fewer production errors. Salesforce aims to deploy one billion AI agents within 12 months, with each agent costing $2 per conversation versus human customer service representatives. The economics are devastating for traditional business models. AI-first companies operate with 80-95% lower operational costs while achieving comparable or superior output. They reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue in 12-18 months versus the traditional 5-10 years. When Cursor generates nearly a billion lines of working code daily, traditional software companies' armies of developers become competitive liabilities, not assets. Boards accustomed to delegating technology oversight to CIOs or audit committees face a rude awakening. Traditional IT governance focuses on infrastructure, cybersecurity, and compliance (the "what" of technology management). AI governance requires understanding the “should” - whether AI capabilities should be deployed, how they impact stakeholders, and what ethical boundaries must be maintained. The fundamental difference: IT systems follow rules; AI systems learn and evolve. When Microsoft’s Tay chatbot learned toxic behavior from social media in 2016, it wasn’t a coding error, it was a governance failure. When COMPAS sentencing software showed racial bias, it wasn’t a bug but rather inadequate board oversight of algorithmic decision-making. Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI research confirms that AI governance can't be delegated like financial oversight. AI creates "network effects" where individual algorithms interact unpredictably. Traditional governance assumes isolated systems; AI governance must address systemic risks from interconnected algorithms making real-time decisions across the enterprise. Just as SOX created demand for Qualified Financial Experts (QFEs), the AI revolution is spawning a new designation: Qualified Technology Experts (QTEs). The market dynamics favor early movers. Spencer Stuart’s 2024 Board Index shows 16% of new S&P 500 independent directors brought digital/technology transformation expertise versus only 8% with traditional P&L leadership. The scarcity is acute: requiring both technology expertise and prior board experience creates a severe talent shortage. This presents both risk and opportunity. For incumbent directors, AI illiteracy becomes a liability targetable by activists. For business-savvy technology leaders or tech-savvy business leaders, board service offers unprecedented opportunities. As one search consultant noted, “Technology roles offer pathways for underrepresented groups to join boards” - diversity through capability rather than tokenism. The SEC has elevated AI to a top 2025 examination priority, with enforcement actions against companies making false AI claims. Former SEC Chair Gary Gentler’s warning that "false claims about AI hurt investors and undermine market integrity" was just the beginning about concerns about the rise of “AI washing,” or exaggerating and misrepresenting the use of AI. The Commission sent comments to 56 companies regarding AI disclosures, with 61% requesting clarification on AI usage and risks. The SEC is increasing concerned about "AI washing" and AI disclosures Internationally, the EU AI Act establishes the world’s first comprehensive AI regulatory framework, with board-level accountability requirements taking effect through 2026. Like GDPR, its extraterritorial reach affects global companies. Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority already requires board accountability for AI-driven decisions, while New York's Department of Financial Services mandates AI risk oversight for insurance companies. The pattern is unmistakable: just as Enron triggered SOX, AI governance failures will trigger mandatory expertise requirements. The only question is whether boards act proactively or wait for the next scandal to force their hand. The data reveals a dangerous disconnect. While nearly 70% of directors trust management’s AI execution skills, only 50% feel adequately informed about AI-related risks. Worse, almost 50% of boards haven’t discussed AI in the past year despite mounting stakeholder pressure. While many academic institutions and trade orgs are trying to fill this need, these traditional director education models (including annual conferences and occasional briefings) can’t match the exponential speed of AI’s evolution. Boards need continuous learning mechanisms, regular AI strategy sessions, and direct access to expertise. The parallels to Sarbanes-Oxley are instructive but incomplete. Financial literacy requirements responded to past failures; AI literacy requirements must anticipate future transformation. When three-person startups with AI agent swarms can outcompete thousand-employee corporations, traditional governance models aren’t ready for these existential threats. The window for proactive adaptation is closing rapidly. ISS tracks AI governance. Institutional investors demand it. Activists target its absence. Regulators prepare mandates. Most critically, AI-native competitors exploit governance gaps with algorithmic efficiency. For boards, the choice is stark: develop AI literacy now while you can shape your approach, or scramble to catch up after activists, regulators, or competitors force your hand. In the post-Enron era, boards asked, "Do we have a qualified financial expert?" In the AI era, the question becomes, "Is every director AI literate?" The answer will determine not just governance quality but corporate survival. Because in a world where algorithms drive business, directors who can’t govern AI can't govern at all.

Title: CoreWeave revives bid for Core Scientific causing shares to surge 33%

CORZ shares jumped nearly 34% on intraday fueled by the acquisition rumors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. CoreWeave is negotiating to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) miner-turned-compute host Core Scientific, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The cloud infrastructure company attempted to acquire the miner for $5.75 per share in June 2024 but withdrew after Core Scientific’s board deemed the price inadequate. Core Scientific and CoreWeave have not issued public statements on the negotiations. Core Scientific’s CORZ stock was trading at $16.44 as of press time, up 33.7% on the session and more than 3x from last year’s proposal. The rally followed a year-to-date slide of about 15% that left the miner trading well below the all-time high it set after emerging from bankruptcy protection in January. CoreWeave, which went public in March with a $75 billion capitalization, lists Microsoft as its largest customer, accounting for 62% of 2024 revenue, and rents Nvidia GPUs to corporate clients that include Meta Platforms and IBM. Executives at Core Scientific dismissed last year’s $1 billion overture as “unsolicited” and below intrinsic value, then signed 12-year hosting agreements that commit the miner to deliver 200 megawatts (MW) of power for CoreWeave’s high-performance-computing clusters. Board members stated at the time that the arrangement would generate approximately $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue and help diversify income away from block subsidies after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific already hosts 16 MW of CoreWeave GPUs at its Austin campus, and plans staged expansions across several sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The parties allegedly aim to finalize terms within weeks if talks stay on track, the sources said. Yet, neither side disclosed price parameters. Core Scientific’s rapid pivot toward AI infrastructure, combined with a power-constrained data-center market, could justify a premium well above the miner’s undisturbed value, bankers following the situation noted. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator seeks to expand capacity to meet the cloud-AI demand that exceeds current inventory across hyperscale providers. Core Scientific controls about 724 megawatts of contracted power across its US footprint and ranks among North America’s top owners of immersion-cooled mining rigs. The miner’s ability to repurpose part of that load for GPU computing aligns with CoreWeave’s push to secure low-cost electricity and ready-built shells, avoiding multiyear greenfield construction. If negotiations succeed, CoreWeave will absorb a fleet of Bitmain S21-class miners and a pipeline of brownfield sites that can flip to GPU racks. Core Scientific shareholders would receive cash or stock at a yet-to-be-determined ratio.

Title: Grads facing tough job market

Time Published: 2025-06-26T20:00:13Z

WASHINGTON — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Title: Digital Harvest: BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street – Shareholders in the Shadows

Editor Economy Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil.

The report assessed that capturing 10 to 30% of global securities and alternative assets by 2034 would bring the on-chain figure closer to the $16 trillion to $30 trillion range. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. RedStone, risk-modeling firm Gauntlet, and analytics provider RWA.xyz project that the on-chain market for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) could reach as much as $30 trillion by 2034, according to a joint report from June 26. Researchers calculate that tokenized RWAs, excluding stablecoins, expanded from roughly $5 billion in 2022 to more than $24 billion by June 2025, an 85% year-over-year increase that positions the sector as crypto’s fastest-growing vertical after dollar-pegged tokens. Private credit drives the total with $14 billion outstanding, while tokenized US Treasury vehicles contribute about $7.5 billion, according to rwa.xyz dashboards embedded in the study. The report modeled several adoption curves and concluded that capturing 10 to 30% of global securities and alternative assets between 2030 and 2034 would bring the on-chain figure closer to the $16 trillion to $30 trillion range. The report stated that BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo now issue production-scale funds on public blockchains, signaling that tokenization has progressed from proof of concept to live deployment in under two years. Yield-bearing Treasury tokens, rebasing share classes, and leveraged private credit loops on Morpho and Kamino demonstrate how decentralized finance (DeFi) rails create new distribution channels and liquidity venues for traditionally illiquid instruments. RedStone argued that accurate pricing hinges on oracle architectures that merge net-asset-value snapshots, regulatory attestations, and illiquidity discounts, a framework that departs from the real-time spot feeds common in DeFi. Gauntlet models indicated that private credit could surpass $250 billion on-chain once tokenized loan origination reaches 5% of the $3 trillion global market. In comparison, Treasury-bill tokens could exceed $1 trillion if asset managers allocate 2% of short-duration funds to blockchain rails. The authors forecasted that programmable compliance layers, such as Securitize’s sToken, and increasing regulatory clarity in the United States, Europe, and Asia would enable pension funds and insurers to allocate directly to tokenized products, broadening the addressable base beyond crypto-native capital. RedStone plans to update the market-size tracker quarterly and add live oracle metrics for on-chain RWA indices. At the same time, Gauntlet will release risk-parameter adjustments for leveraged vaults tied to private credit pools. The consortium will host further briefings at the RWA Summit in Cannes on July 1, where it will publish granular inflow data and the methodology underpinning its $30 trillion upper-bound model. The report identified the current $24 billion footprint as roughly 0.006% of the $400 trillion in traditional assets but contends that institutional issuance velocity and programmable settlement advantages justify a $30 trillion scenario within nine years.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Ireland
URL: https://www.shopify.com/ie/enterprise/blog/customer-lifetime-value-after-black-friday-cyber-monday
Time Published: 2025-06-26T18:05:16Z

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Ireland

Time Published: 2025-06-26T18:05:16Z

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors.

While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company’s work is now completed by AIâthough no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he’ll be giving up. âAll of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,â Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce’s employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company’s own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it’s ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company’s workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That seems to be the underlying message of much of tech’s embrace of AI: get ready for layoffs. Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Microsoft is in the midst of a second round of layoffs, per Fast Company, after already cutting its staff by 6,000 in May and shifting lots of money into AI investments. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. Oftentimes, whether it’s made explicit or not, corporate adoption of AI is the underlying reason for the cuts. Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, recently spoke with tech workers who have been affected by AI and found that the technology is reshaping jobs and workforces as a whole. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service’s reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool. artificial intellienceLaborlayoffsmarc benioffSalesforce Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Pitches US Military on Using Its Satellites for 'Tactical Communication'

Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile is pitching its satellite-to-phone technology to US military groups, a sign that AST and SpaceX are poised to go head-to-head in competing for defense contracts. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile has already demonstrated that its giant satellites can power voice and video calls on consumer smartphones in cellular dead zones. But on Thursday, the company touted a successful demo of its technology for "tactical satellite communication" purposes. The demo, conducted in Hawaii, involved using AST's BlueBird satellites to beam communications to a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), which is usually mapping-related software designed for military operations. TAK can also be installed on smartphones. "The field test showcased key defense-related use cases, including real-time connectivity to the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) over a VPN, multimedia streaming via TAK, and secure multi-party video calls, all executed on standard, unmodified smartphones,” AST said in the announcement. Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases. In AST’s case, the company has partnered with Maryland-based Fairwinds Technologies, which specializes in bringing commercial tech to military customers. In 2023, AST reached an agreement with Fairwinds to explore marketing the satellite technology to the military market. Earlier this year, AST also received a new $43 million contract from the US Space Development Agency under the US Space Force to help advance military communications. In the consumer market, SpaceX is offering its cellular Starlink system through T-Mobile, with the official launch scheduled for July 23. Following the ongoing free beta program, the add-on satellite connectivity will cost $10 per month for most consumers. AST has been working on its rival satellite service through partners AT&T and Verizon. The company is aiming to kick off its own beta early next year as it prepares to launch dozens of large satellites into Earth’s orbit. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases. In AST’s case, the company has partnered with Maryland-based Fairwinds Technologies, which specializes in bringing commercial tech to military customers. In 2023, AST reached an agreement with Fairwinds to explore marketing the satellite technology to the military market. Earlier this year, AST also received a new $43 million contract from the US Space Development Agency under the US Space Force to help advance military communications. In the consumer market, SpaceX is offering its cellular Starlink system through T-Mobile, with the official launch scheduled for July 23. Following the ongoing free beta program, the add-on satellite connectivity will cost $10 per month for most consumers. AST has been working on its rival satellite service through partners AT&T and Verizon. The company is aiming to kick off its own beta early next year as it prepares to launch dozens of large satellites into Earth’s orbit.

AN ONLINE FUNDRAISER to cover the funeral expenses of a teenager who drowned in Co Meath has hit its target ahead of tomorrow’s service. Kofi Jackson Owusu, aged 15 and from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth, died last Friday after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said the school was heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He described Kofi as “very kind and very caring”. Advertisement Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He was a member of Redeemer Celtic Football Club in Dundalk and the club started a GoFundMe to support Kofi’s family with funeral costs. The club described Kofi as a “highly respectful youngster” who was a “credit to his loving family”. The online fundraiser has surpassed its goal ahead of Kofi’s funeral service tomorrow. His funeral service will take place at The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Miracle Land, Castletown Road, Dundalk tomorrow at 1pm. Afterwards, the congregation will proceed to St. Patrick’s Cemetery for burial. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Why Companies Need To Institute Stricter AI Policies

ByMegan Poinski andCIO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. As the hype grows around AI and more people try it out, many are using it at work to see how it can help them become more efficient. But there’s a real problem: Some employees are using public instances of chatbots, putting proprietary company data at risk by giving an open LLM access. Others use the company’s access to AI, but input highly sensitive and personal data, like Social Security numbers and financial data. A new study from technology security company Kiteworks found that 27% of companies reported that nearly a third of all of the data sent to AI systems is the type of information that should be kept private, like company records, employee information and trade secrets. (It could be more; 17% of companies don’t know how much private data ends up getting sent to AI.) It’s a problem that’s growing. A Stanford University report on AI found a 56.4% increase in security incidents with the technology last year. While it may seem obvious to the tech savvy, many employees might not know the risks of this kind of AI sharing, and 83% of companies only rely on training or warning emails to let them know. Kiteworks found that just 17% have automatic controls that keep employees from uploading sensitive information to public AI tools. Further, most companies don’t have much of an AI governance structure—only 9%, according to Deloitte research cited by Kiteworks. The study results show that companies need to add policies and infrastructure to control employee use of AI and protect their own data. This kind of use can cause real damage to companies—not to mention their employees and clients. The study concludes that companies need to acknowledge the threat, deploy controls that can be verified, and ensure that they can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. “With incidents surging, zero-day attacks targeting the security infrastructure itself, and the vast majority lacking real visibility or control, the window for implementing meaningful protections is rapidly closing,” Kiteworks CMO Tim Freestone said in a statement. Many people still haven’t grasped how to truly use AI to benefit their company—we all know its practical business functions go beyond asking a chatbot for advice. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about how to bring AI to your company and get people using it. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the VivaTech technology startup and innovation fair in Paris earlier this month. Nvidia is back on top, pulling ahead of Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company. A research note on Wednesday from Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target for Nvidia’s stock from $175 to $250. Baruah wrote that Nvidia will lead the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI, and will see “stronger-than-anticipated demand.” The research note—as well as Nvidia’s annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Jensen Huang laid out an optimistic view of the company’s future—drove the company’s stock to hit a record high of $154.43. While share prices dropped somewhat before markets closed, it was a banner day for the chips company. Chips and robotics company, that is. At the annual meeting, Nvidia positioned itself squarely in the robotics and physical industrial AI spaces. In the company’s annual report, Huang wrote that so far this year, Nvidia has fundamentally transformed itself from a chip maker to a builder of infrastructure. While AI data centers will continue to be important, AI-powered robots in factories, hospitals, farms and cities will be what moves society forward in the not-so-distant future. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” Huang said at the meeting, according to CNBC. An Iranian man stands in his apartment in Tehran, which was destroyed by Israeli attacks. While it seems for now that the physical conflict between Iran and Israel—which the U.S. inserted itself into by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities—is on hold, the war will likely still be bitterly fought online. Forbes’ Thomas Brewster writes that Iran, which has a “robust cyber apparatus” according to Middle East cybersecurity experts, is likely to launch disruptive attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests. For the U.S. government, this could be especially challenging. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has lost many experienced employees and does not even have a permanent director. Insiders told Forbes that CISA already is stretched thin, but coordinated attacks from Iran could make it much worse. The PR war over how the attacks are seen is also riddled with conflicting imagery. AI-generated Iranian propaganda showing a rocket launch and a convoy of tanks and missiles have racked up millions of views, writes Forbes’ Emily Baker-White. These videos, which were seen throughout social media, abruptly disappeared. None of the platforms have any policies against releasing propaganda, and the videos didn’t appear to be labeled as AI-generated. getty AI can be a force for good, but it can also be nefarious. New research from Barracuda, Columbia University and the University of Chicago found that AI writes more than half of all spam email now, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. This includes the vast majority of messages in your personal account’s spam folder—but it’s also getting prevalent in business emails as well. About 14% of business inbox attacks, in which often senior people in organizations are targeted with requests for financial transactions, are written by AI. Winder writes that it makes sense to use AI for spam. It tends to do a passable job of writing with proper grammar and spelling across a variety of languages. It can also write in a convincing way to provoke a recipient to respond. The study found that attackers seem to be using AI to draft different versions of spam and hacking emails, searching for the best way to get a recipient’s attention. SkyPhi Studios cofounder and COO Lindsay Phillips. AI truly can transform the way we do business, but in order for it to make a difference, employees actually need to use it. AI is unlike any other tech shift in recent years, and it can be difficult for everyone at a company to embrace it. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about the best way to get your employees through these challenges. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is the biggest hurdle that you see to widespread AI adoption in companies? Phillips: The biggest hurdle is companies approaching AI as a software shift, and AI is really a mindset shift. It’s not just about teaching people how to do the same work in a different tool. They have to completely change how they think about work, how they think about the value that they’re bringing to the workplace, how they approach their workflows. Companies that are just trying to make tools available and don’t help people understand how to use it, how to adopt it successfully and how to integrate it, are running into adoption challenges. How do you get past that roadblock? Understanding how you want people to change to use the tool. Understanding how roles and responsibilities need to change, the RACI [responsibility matrix] that’s required so that folks adopt this tool and integrate it into their workflows. You want to also make sure that leadership across the org understands that strategy. Most folks want to get guidance from their manager, so you want to leverage leadership cascades and really make sure they’re carrying that message forward and reinforcing it. The other thing that we’re seeing with companies that are successful is a community of practice: Creating ambassadors throughout the org, at the ground level, boots on the street, that are supporting their team members and adopting these tools and helping them make that mindset shift. How does the move toward AI compare to other technology shifts in the past, like moving to the cloud and increasing cybersecurity? It definitely feels like we’re driving the car while we’re building the car, so we need our team members to be very collaborative in helping us figure out how to use these tools. Experts are going to be able to tell you how AI is going to be able to make their jobs more productive and be able to help them do their work better. Leadership’s not necessarily going to know that, so it really does need to be a lot more collaborative and agile than it needed to be in the past. In the past, you find requirements, you help people adopt those new ways of working, you meet those requirements. This we’re figuring it out as we go, and it’s much more experimental. What sets the companies that are most successfully integrating AI apart? A comfort with experimentation and a certain amount of comfort with uncertainty of saying, ‘We’re going to give it a try. We’re going to see how it goes, and we’ll pivot as we need to.’ Companies that are very attached to clarity and certainty and always having the right answer are going to struggle with AI adoption. It’s not a linear straight path. It is going to be something you have to figure out as you go. What advice would you give to executives that are trying to get their employees to use AI? The more accessible we can make it, the better. There’s companies doing weekly challenges. Just start to encourage your folks to incorporate it into their daily lives. Encourage folks to share wins. You want to hear about how other people are using these tools so that it can give you ideas of how you can also use it in your day-to-day. It is a massive mindset shift. Approach it with little tiny bites that you can take to start to shift habits daily. As more companies adopt enterprise AI packages, several trends in what they are using and how are coming to the surface. Here are 10 trends that are shaping enterprise LLM use today. While part of business advancement today is all about personal branding and showing the world your expertise and strategic viewpoint, you may feel more comfortable quietly sitting in front of a screen. The good news is that you don’t have to be an extrovert. Here are some tips for shy people who want to build personal brands. After Meta’s deal to take a 49% stake in data-labeling company Scale AI, another company with a very different main business stepped up as a potential giant in data labeling. Which company is it? A.

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster.

Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficultâor impossibleâto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factorsâsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)âcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysisâa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "â¦any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "â¦total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10â The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "â¦agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking processâmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a ruleâan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefitsâsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scopeâbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insightsâespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity frameworkâthe net stable funding ratioâwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisionsâsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trialsâwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "â¦ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groupsâit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirementsâwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional windowâhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policyâand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

The views expressed in this note are ours and do not reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System. Return to text 2. Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them. Return to text 3. See Executive Order No. 12866, 58 Federal Register 51735 (October 4, 1993) and Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (final-2003 and proposed-2023 versions). Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "â¦all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)â¦" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms â which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post. Return to text 19. In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same systemâand incur a similar absolute costâas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27. See List (2024) for a discussion of how to optimally generate policy-relevant evidence before scaling an intervention. Return to text 28. See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and Rösch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al. (2021) for a description of these and other pilot programs and for several references to studies that were based on these pilot programs. Return to text 40. See Abramowicz, Ayres, and Listokin (2011) for further discussion of the benefits of randomizing laws and regulations. Return to text 41. See Silverman and Chalmers (2001), Erikson and Stoker (2010), Gramlich (2017), and Weldon (2017) for a discussion of public perspectives on fairness in these contexts. Return to text 42. See Rawls (1971) for a discussion of the fairness of equality prior to resolution of uncertainty (i.e., being behind the veil of ignorance). Return to text 43. The Mexican anti-poverty program Progresa/Oportunidades was designed for evaluation using a randomized design. The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017). Due to lack of available funds to cover all eligible citizens, Oregon randomized who was covered by a Medicaid expansion in 2008, giving important insights actual benefits of government health insurance (Allen et al, 2010; DeVoe et al, 2015). Return to text 44. The Census Bureau frequently asks multiple versions of a question when introducing a potential question to the American Community Survey. In addition, extensive effort typically goes into the revision of existing questions to validate when and if the new and old series are comparable. See Census Bureau (2020). Return to text 45.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. While Tesla has done its best to create a relentless hype cycle around its just-launched robotaxis, with a curated bunch of Tesla-supporting influencers receiving the first invites to test the service, and their ensuing flowery reports playing an important role in supporting Tesla's share price, the reality is much more nuanced, and lies somewhere in the middle of the sunny optimism emanating from the EV giant's quarters and the literal death knells that its opponents are sounding with an alarming frequency. Now, BMO Capital's Autonomous Vehicle (AV) expert has chimed in with a less-than-flattering view of the performance of Tesla's robotaxis over the past few days. BMO Capital's AV Expert: 'Waymo Is Miles Ahead’ We hosted an autonomous vehicle (AV) expert who previously worked at Waymo and now collaborates with policymakers to advance the AV industry. Our expert suggested that the industry is in the early innings of its commercialization… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) June 26, 2025 To wit, BMO Capital has now disclosed in its latest note that it recently hosted an AV expert who had previously worked at Waymo and currently advises governments on advancing the AV industry. While conceding that the industry was still in the "early innings" of the ongoing commercialization race, this expert boldly pronounced that Waymo was "miles ahead of the AV competition," ranking Chinese players - Baidu and Pony.ai - as distant seconds, followed by Amazon's Zoox and May Mobility. Critically, according to the AV expert, Tesla remained "significantly behind" Waymo in the rapidly heating AV commercialization race. The expert then points out that a typical driver associated with a given ride-share service undertakes between 15 and 20 rides per day. This contrasts sharply with Waymo's current cadence of between 20 and 25 rides per day. To unlock the economies of scale, however, Waymo will have to scale to 50 rides per day per vehicle, according to this expert. As a refresher, Waymo currently operates an autonomous ride-hailing service in 5 US cities via a fleet of around 1,500 Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, with each such vehicle equipped with an expensive array of sensors, including LiDAR, 360-degree view cameras, and a radar, all feeding into onboard compute resources. On the other hand, Tesla's robotaxis leverage an interconnected neural network along with cameras that are supposedly capable of counting individual photons, although some experts doubt that these cameras are capable of such a feat. Coming back, BMO Capital's AV expert concedes that the expensive LiDAR sensors, which are critical for depth perception, currently remain "a key cost constraint to scaling AVs." The expert asserts that Tesla would be at a distinct advantage if its camera-based, vision-only AV solution were to ultimately prove as effective as Waymo's multiple sensors-based approach. After only 4 days, Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin has already logged one incident of "Safety Concern", giving it a rate of 0.25/day so far. Waymo has 22 Safety Concern incidents since testing began 359 days ago (0.06/day) & 14 since service began in March (0.12/day).$TSLA pic.twitter.com/LryAHvLToX — Motorhead (@BradMunchen) June 26, 2025 We noted in a previous post that the NHTSA has now reportedly contacted Tesla after various videos recently surfaced, showing robotaxis committing various traffic violations, which include failure to adhere to lane discipline as well as speed limit violations. For context, do note that Waymo has logged fewer critical errors over its 10 million completed miles than Tesla has over the past few days, and that too, with a fleet of just 11 robotaxis operating in a geofenced area of Austin, replete with an employee stationed in the front passenger seat and supported by a dedicated team of teleoperators, who are mandated to take over in case of an emergency! Of course, despite all the hype surrounding Tesla's FSD, it is still widely considered a Level 2 autonomous driving system, as opposed to Waymo's, which is classified as a Level 4 system. Not everything is doom and gloom around Tesla, however. For one, the brokerage firm Benchmark has just hiked its target for Tesla shares from $350 to $475, citing the EV giant's demonstration of a "controlled and safety-first approach" to its robotaxis, which can speed up the regulatory approval process. Benchmark goes on to note: "We are a believer in TSLA’s camera-focused approach that is not only cost effective but also scalable." Do note that Tesla has given up the entirety of this week's gains, and is currently trading flat on a 5-day basis. Over the past month, the stock is down around 10 percent.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artifical intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate work force over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT’s hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It’s a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn’t hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

Title: NATO’s 5 percent spending pledge is a threat to people and the planet
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/26/natos-5-percent-spending-pledge-is-a-threat-to-people-and-the-planet
Time Published: 2025-06-26T13:32:50Z

The alliance’s spending surge will prompt war, cut services and worsen the climate crisis. NATO’s leaders agreed this week to invest 5 percent of their countries’ gross domestic product (GDP) on “core defence requirements as well as defence and security-related spending by 2035”. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called it a “quantum leap” in spending that would guarantee “freedom and security” for the military alliance’s one billion people. It certainly is historic in terms of military escalation, but will it deliver security – and if so, for whom? The headline demand for 5 percent GDP spending has been so loud, it’s easy to forget that for a long time, many NATO members considered the previous 2 percent goal either unachievable or unimportant. NATO first committed to its 2 percent GDP goal in 2002, but by 2021, only six of its members had achieved it. Yet three years later, 23 members had met the goal and all 32 are expected to comply by the end of 2025. This week, NATO has committed to more than doubling its spending to 5 percent of GDP. This will be partly met through creative accounting and reflects a desire to trumpet a big number to satisfy a petulant President Trump. The 5 percent headline includes 1.5 percent spent on military-related infrastructure, which could be broadly defined to include civilian expenditure. Even so, it reflects a huge escalation of military expenditure over the next decade from an already very high level. Last year, NATO spent $1.5 trillion on the military – more than half of global military spending. If members comply with the core 3.5 percent target by 2030, that would mean a total of $13.4 trillion in military expenditure. It’s an impossible figure to grasp, but if you stacked it in one-dollar bills, you could make almost four piles that reach the moon. It could also be distributed as a one-off cash bonus of $1,674 to every person on the planet. In reality, the money will be diverted – most of all from social and environmental spending – even though 30 percent of Europeans report difficulty in making ends meet and climate scientists warn that we have two years left to keep temperature increases below the international target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who fought for a partial exemption from the 5 percent goal, was the most honest about this costly trade-off: “If we had accepted 5 percent, Spain would have to spend by 2035 an extra 300 billion euros on defence. Where would it come from? From cuts in health and education.” Social and environmental spending is already on the chopping block. In February, the United Kingdom announced it would reduce its aid budget to 0.3 percent of GDP to pay for military spending increases – a year after it won an election committing to increase foreign aid. Belgium, the Netherlands and France followed suit, announcing aid cuts of 25 to 37 percent. The United States, under Trump, has decimated its overseas aid and climate programmes and reduced healthcare funding while proposing a record $1 trillion expenditure on the Pentagon. Europe is falling far behind on its own environmental and social goals, with its primary funding vehicle, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), expiring in 2026. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) concludes that most European NATO members will be unable to meet the 3.5 percent NATO target without cutting budgets, raising taxes or changing fiscal rules. NATO’s spending spree will not only divert money – it will worsen the climate crisis. As one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, it is investing in more gas-guzzling jets, tanks and missiles. Military emissions are notoriously hard to track due to limited data, but one report estimates that 3.5 percent of GDP spending would lead to 2,330 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2030 – roughly the same as the combined annual emissions of Brazil and Japan. NATO’s justification is that increased investment is needed to confront the threats of “Russia” and “terrorism”. Yet there is no rationale behind the 5 percent target or details on why threats to NATO have so drastically increased. Nor is there self-examination on how NATO’s actions partly set the stage for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has increased military spending, but it still spends 10 times less than NATO. Nor could it catch up militarily with NATO’s 32-strong alliance, given its economy: $2 trillion in 2024 (nominal GDP), compared with $26 trillion for non-US NATO countries and $29 trillion for the US alone. As for “terrorism”, the idea that NATO’s increased spending could deter it ignores the failures of the “War on Terror”, where NATO interventions in Afghanistan and Libya prompted instability and fighter recruitment. The security NATO seems most concerned with is that of its arms firms. Long before Trump’s pressure, arms firms have pushed for higher European military spending through lobbying groups like the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). They have successfully made military security an overriding European Union objective, winning ever more public money for research and industry support. Now they are reaping the rewards with booming revenues and profits. Before the NATO summit, BlackRock released an investment report celebrating the arms industry as a “dynamic growth industry” and a “mega force” that will drive investment trends in the coming years. NATO’s idea of security diverts money from social needs, worsens the climate crisis, rewards arms firms profiting from global conflict, and chooses war over diplomacy. Its bellicose stance in The Hague this week makes it one of the greatest threats to global security – even to life on this planet. It is up to the peoples of NATO countries to reject this deadly path and reclaim security based on cooperation, justice and peace.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang begins sale of $925M worth of Nvidia stock — sale of 6 million shares barely dents his $123 billion in shares

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company’s stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company’s stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang’s timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia’s value hit record highs. This also isn’t the first time that Nvidia’s C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia’s massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Title: 4 Popular Dividends For The Geopolitical Conflicts Unfolding Now

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Military Mission at twilight Let’s talk about oil and gold dividends. Whether or not the new peace in the Middle East holds, there are some high-quality dividends worth owning anytime. These generous payers (up to 8%) provide peace of mind just in case the geopolitical Jenga set gets knocked loose again. We’ll start with crude, which had rallied to one-year highs. I was originally going to advise not chasing the Strait of Hormuz oil rally. Futures indicated (and still do) that lower prices are likely ahead. January 2026 still trades cheaper—suggesting temporary disruption at worst. Back at home, you’ve probably heard (not least from me, often) that President Donald Trump wants a lower fed funds rate To achieve this, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are targeting lower oil (“drill baby, drill”) so that inflation continues to cool and the Fed can ease. Given policymakers’ penchant for deregulation and drilling, it’s best to sidestep the producers here. We have done well owning Exxon Mobil (XOM) in the past but the time to buy the stock is when oil prices are likely to rise. Exxon has grinded sideways since we sold it from our Contrarian Income Report portfolio. Let’s consider Kinder Morgan (KMI) and its 4.2% yield instead. Kinder funds its dividend by “collecting tolls” on its 79,000 miles of pipelines. Crude oil and most notably natural gas flow through Kinder’s North America pipelines. As long as energy moves, the cash flows. A huge 40% of U.S. natural gas flows through Kinder’s systems to 139 company-owned terminals storing petroleum products, chemicals and renewables. With market share like this, Kinder can raise its pricing regularly and therefore boost dividends often too. When the company was founded back in 1997 (or “back in the 1900s” as my kids say) by Richard Kinder and William Morgan, they structured it as a master limited partnership. MLPs issue K-1 forms at tax time, which can be a bit of a headache. Instead of forcing shareholders into a lifetime of tax-time headaches, Kinder converted into a simpler corporation in 2014. Corporations issue a traditional 1099, which is easier for accountants and users of tax software. This move made Kinder more popular and awarded it a perennially higher valuation. For those of us who prefer lower valuations (and higher yields), Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is an elite 8% dividend play. Alerian buys MLPs and packages them into one fund, consolidating messy K-1s into a neat 1099 at tax time—a “cheat code” for easy 8% energy dividends. These are salad days for Alerian, too. The fund has raised its dividend for three straight quarters! AMLP Dividend Let’s move on to gold, the “barbarous relic” that investors buy when they feel nervous. We contrarians are bullish because: Creditors will be paid back, because the U.S. owns the global printing press. But they will ultimately receive depreciated dollars due to some “monetization” of this massive debt load. The U.S. dollar is already eroding, falling 28% versus gold year-to-date — 28%! A shiny sign of capital flowing into assets immune to central bank printing. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is a one-click way to play higher gold and lower oil prices. Energy is the main cost input for gold miners. Profit margins will expand from here if gold stays high and oil slumps. A high-quality discounted alternative is GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN), a closed-end fund trading at a 2% discount to its net asset value. About half of the fund’s portfolio sits in mining stocks—both gold and non-gold plays like iron miner Rio Tinto (RIO). Thanks to the deal we can snag these stocks for 98 cents on the dollar. GGN pays a steady 3-cent monthly dividend (8% annualized), giving investors income stability with upside potential. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

June 26, 2025 08:36 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, surging along with stock markets despite fears of a “Doomsday” scenario for the markets and the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared back toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, up around 50% from its April lows and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump surprising traders with a “massive” crypto prediction. Now, as the crypto market braces for a Congress game-changer predicted to “unleash” trillions, a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price to a $5 trillion market capitalization by 2030—putting it alongside technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The "de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism" has been named as the ... More driving force behind a huge $5 trillion bitcoin price prediction. Philippe Laffont, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, has added bitcoin to his Fantastic 40 list, a collection of investments he thinks will be the biggest winners over the next five years. Laffont’s list, which features Microsoft, Nvidia, bitcoin, Amazon and Meta as the top five and doesn't include tech giants Apple or Google at all, can be seen in full here. "I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, 'why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in it?' And it just goes up and up," Laffont told CNBC, adding that, “sometimes you have to change your mind and you have to say, well, 'I made a mistake.'” According to Laffont, who claims he hasn't bought bitcoin yet, its price could more than double to give bitcoin a market capitalization of over $5 trillion by 2030, with Microsoft forecast to soar to $5.7 trillion and Nvidia to $5.6 trillion. "I always thought, bitcoin's amazing, but it's double or triple the volatility of the Nasdaq," Laffont said. "It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down." Laffont pointed to the gold's $22 trillion market cap as justification for bitcoin's performance over the next few years, along with "the de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism."

(Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when the market declines, as discussed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Micron Technology shares rose 2 per cent in premarket trading on Thursday, after a robust forecast from the chipmaker for fourth-quarter revenue on booming demand for its memory chips that power AI data centers. The company saw a nearly 50 per cent jump in sales of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for the third quarter compared to the previous three months. Micron is one of the providers of HBM chips besides South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung "AI servers are giving Micron an over-caffeinated growth spurt... (and) Micron is the only kid on the block shipping HBM3E at scale," said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner at Running Point Capital Advisors. Micron said it will continue to invest in HBM chips which reflects the growing demand from AI chip front runners - Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, who are customers of the company.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Luxembourg-based Quintet Private Bank, with operations across Europe and the UK, has integrated private markets exposure into its client portfolios. Clients with relevant portfolios can now access actively managed exposure to alternative assets, including private equity, private credit, and real assets. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more These are offered through selected evergreen private markets funds, complementing traditional allocations to equities, fixed income, and commodities. This integration was facilitated by a collaboration with BlackRock and the implementation of the European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) framework, effective since last year. This framework reduces liquidity and operational constraints, enabling continuous capital raising, reinvestment, and flexible redemptions. This allows investors to access private markets with simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional public markets. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Bryan Crawford, group head of investment & client solutions and member of the Authorized Management Committee at Quintet, said: “Diversification is a cornerstone of portfolio resilience, especially during periods of heightened volatility. “We are therefore delighted to partner with BlackRock to integrate exposure to private markets in client portfolios, supporting increased diversification and creating new opportunities to access long-term growth themes.” Quintet’s private markets offering includes BlackRock’s private markets platform, which manages over €600bn in assets pro forma across multi-alternatives and private equity strategies for investors in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. BlackRock EMEA Wealth Alternatives Specialists Team head Fabio Osta said: “By supporting the integration of private markets into wealth portfolios, we are making investing in alternatives easier and more accessible for a broader range of investors so they can benefit from the typically higher returns and diversification the asset class offers.” This announcement follows Quintet’s launch of multi-manager UCITS funds last year, also co-designed with BlackRock. These actively managed, single-asset-class funds, exclusive to Quintet clients, combine third-party managers to enhance diversification and portfolio performance. Earlier this year, Quintet introduced Future+, a sustainable investment mandate developed with BlackRock, adhering to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/college-graduates-face-toughest-job-market-decade-hiring-123221189
Time Published: 2025-06-26T09:46:25Z
Full Content:
Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade WASHINGTON -- While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

In 2024, Asia-Pacific dominated the cryogenic insulation market, contributing $2.87 billion (40.67%) of the total. Continued growth is anticipated in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe, with CAGRs of 7.47% and 6.09% respectively. Other promising markets include the Middle East and South America, expected to grow at CAGRs of 5.78% and 5.45% respectively. The market landscape remains fragmented, with the top ten competitors holding a combined 24.15% share in 2023. BASF SE led the sector with a 3.57% market share, closely followed by players like Armacell International Holding GmbH and Lydall Inc. Product segmentation includes cellular, fibrous, flake, granular, reflective, and other types, with cellular being the largest segment (50.73% in 2024) and reflective expected to show the fastest growth (CAGR of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029). In terms of application, storage tanks represented the largest segment (36.75% in 2024), while the terminals segment promises rapid growth (CAGR 6.96%). The energy and power industry remains the primary end-use sector, with the anticipated accelerated growth at a CAGR of 7.25% by 2029. Significant opportunities exist across segments, particularly in the cellular market (projected $1.3 billion gain by 2029) and storage tanks ($1.0 billion). The energy segment alone could see a $1.14 billion increase by 2029. Notably, China is poised to gain $606.38 million within the sector. Strategic approaches for market players include developing partnerships to enhance innovation, advancing hydrogen storage solutions, and launching high-performance insulation panels.

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z
Full Content:
Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape workforces. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforces. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said.

Recently, retail service provider Shopify said that teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, plans to replace its external workers with AI gradually. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders, with Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, warning of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany, believes that the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argue that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The efficacy of many AI tools will also depend on how well they are integrated into workplaces, and the willingness and ability of workers to use them. If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urges companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Bitcoin's BTC$107,340.06 price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. "DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin," Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. "We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely," Altrichter said. Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg, interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

Title: How To Care About Your Job When It Doesn't Care About You

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Use the controls in the far right panel to increase or decrease the number of terms automatically displayed (or to completely turn that feature off). Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: “CAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions” and #2221803: “Collaborative Research: CAS—Climate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.” Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5–3.0 °C energy decarbonisation pathways, Šimaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period.

Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Title: Devastating Layoffs Hit the Walt Disney Company

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.

Δ The rise took the company’s market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company’s latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company’s stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company’s total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a “chip company” but rather as a provider of “AI infrastructure” or “computing platform,” per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,” Huang said. “Nvidia is ready.” Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks’ Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Drivers across the US frustrated over their car’s paint jobs flaking off ‘in sheets,’ costing them thousands

Manage your account Thousands of drivers across the country are discovering their car paint jobs are literally peeling away — and fixing it could cost them thousands out of pocket. For Ed Rinkowitz, a Florida Hyundai owner, the flaky paint job is a familiar and frustrating sight. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it “My daughter's hood basically just flaked completely off, probably maybe 10% of the paint was left on it,” Rinkowitz told 10 Tampa Bay. “Then my wife’s car started and that was probably 30 to 40% that was coming off.” Rinkowitz says it’s the third Hyundai in his family with paint issues — and he’s far from alone. A Facebook group called “Hyundai Paint Peel / Peeling” has grown to over 6,000 members, all sharing stories of paint jobs seemingly disintegrating. So what’s causing the problem, and what can drivers do to protect their cars and wallets? While the issue spans several Hyundai models and paint colors, Rinkowitz says two of his affected vehicles were white — a trend echoed by dozens of other drivers. News station 10 Investigates also spoke with owners of Kia, Toyota and Chevrolet vehicles reporting similar issues. Rinkowitz brought his concerns to the dealership, but hit a wall. “I’ve got two white 2015 Elantras, very similar models, and they said, ‘Well, it’s not under warranty,’” he told 10 Investigates. Instead, he was told to go to a body shop — a fix he didn’t feel should fall on him. And it isn’t cheap. According to Bankrate, repainting a car can cost anywhere from $300 to more than $20,000, depending on the vehicle size, paint type and finish. A typical paint job costs around $3,000. A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Hyundai customers who say their paint peeled off prematurely. In response, some automakers have extended warranties and issued recalls. Hyundai announced a paint warranty extension for eight models, including 2017 and 2018 Elantras, Sonatas and Santa Fes. The coverage applies to peeling or bubbling white paint, especially around the hood, fenders and roof. Other drivers haven’t been as lucky. One Toyota Corolla owner told 10 Investigates that her dealership said the paint recall expired last year — even though her paint is now peeling off her car with just a spray from a garden hose. Read more: You don’t have to be a millionaire to gain access to this $1B private real estate fund. In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how Whether the issue is a manufacturer defect or not, there are steps car owners can take to help prevent paint damage before it gets worse. Parking in a garage or shaded area helps. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, bird droppings, tree sap and hail can speed up peeling and cracking. UV rays, in particular, cause paint to fade and break down over time. If your car’s paint starts to peel, don’t assume you're out of options. Attorney Charles Gallagher says a denied warranty claim isn’t necessarily the end of the road. He recommends asking the manufacturer for a warranty extension, especially if the issue stems from a known defect in the paint or its application. Automakers have their own processes for addressing paint complaints. Hyundai advises drivers to check their vehicle identification number (VIN) on the company’s website to see if they qualify for a paint warranty extension. Kia recommends starting with your local dealership, but if that doesn’t work, the company encourages contacting its customer care team directly. For now, many drivers are still trying to figure out what to do. “I’m 70 years old. I’ve owned cars since I was like 16 years old,” Rinkowitz said. “I’ve never had a car where the paint flaked off like that.” This tiny hot Costco item has skyrocketed 74% in price in under 2 years — but now the retail giant is restricting purchases. Here’s how to buy the coveted asset in bulk Robert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US — with millions of Americans going poor. But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead Here are 5 ‘must have’ items that Americans (almost) always overpay for — and very quickly regret.

BREAKING NEWS Christopher Rugaber Associated Press Published: June 25, 2025 at 5:23 PM Updated: June 26, 2025 at 3:02 PM Christopher Rugaber Associated Press WASHINGTON – While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. Recommended Videos “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Uber made a big change to how it prices trips. It might be the real secret to the company's turnaround.

A new study suggests that Uber pulled off quite a feat — raising fares, lowering driver pay, and increasing profits — with a subtle change in pricing. The analysis, which is based on a trove of data from a single driver, offers some insight into a strategy that the researchers say explains the company's financial turnaround. In 2022, Uber moved away from a formula based largely on the length of a trip and started rolling out what it calls "upfront pricing," which gives a price to riders and potential earnings to drivers before they accept a trip. Behind the scenes, Uber's algorithms use a variety of factors, not just the length of the trip and demand, to determine rider prices and driver earnings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has touted upfront pricing's ability to offer specific prices based on the company's data and AI analysis. "Anyone can price based on time and distance," he said during a quarterly earnings call in late 2023. "We'll be able to price out that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger dataset than anyone else in the world." These days, upfront pricing is standard in most parts of the US and many of Uber's international markets. The strategy may be the secret ingredient behind Uber's 300% stock rally over the past three years, a new study indicates. Upfront pricing has been "enabling the company to raise rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of rideshare trips, systematically, selectively, and opaquely," Len Sherman, an executive in residence and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the report released Monday. The study, which is based on about seven years of trip data from one driver, found that changes to fares and driver pay could vary by trip. Sherman's report said that Uber had come close to being a master of what economists call "price discrimination," or determining the exact maximum that riders are willing to pay — or the exact minimum that a driver is willing to accept — for a trip. The term doesn't refer to discrimination based on race, sex, or other personal characteristics, but rather discrimination based on a person's needs and desires in a particular situation. It's a concept that economists have talked about in introductory economics courses for decades, but it was largely theoretical, Sherman told Business Insider in an interview. "They cracked the nut," Sherman said. "They have the data and the algorithms and the machine learning to come closer to being able to do that than anyone else." Since implementing upfront pricing, Uber's stock price has risen nearly fourfold from a low of about 40% below its initial public offering price. In 2023, for the first time in its history, Uber reported an annual profit. The performance rally helped Khosrowshahi secure the option to buy about $130 million in additional Uber stock early last year, as part of an incentive plan. In a statement at the end of Sherman's report, Uber said its upfront pricing strategy was "designed it be transparent and fair for both riders and drivers." The company also said its pricing algorithms "do not use information about an individual rider or driver's personal characteristics." In a statement to BI, an Uber spokesperson called Sherman's findings "a tired, misleading story." When Uber first launched, the compensation model used a rate card, with pay based on the length of trips. Under upfront pricing, drivers' earnings have plummeted, even as the costs of working as a ride-hailing driver, such as gas and car maintenance, have increased, the study found. Many of Sherman's findings come from an analysis of one driver's trip data — information that Uber allows drivers to download. The information includes details about how much the driver got paid, how much Uber charged the rider, and how long each trip was. The worker whose data Sherman used was described as a "power driver." The study examined just under 25,000 trips that this driver completed while working close to full time for Uber between 2018 and February 2025. The driver saw pay cuts starting in September 2022, around the time Uber rolled out upfront pricing, the study found. Over the preceding two years, many drivers had seen their pay increase while driving during the pandemic, the report said. "We've seen this kind of narrative before — one driver's data and a lot of speculation spun into a sweeping indictment," an Uber spokesperson said. "The facts are simpler: upfront pricing is designed to increase clarity for both riders and drivers, not to manipulate them." If Uber can apply these methods to one driver, Sherman said, it has an incentive to do the same across a wide swath of its contractors. "The question, therefore, isn't whether our profiled driver is truly representative of all US drivers," Sherman wrote, "but rather, given Uber's massive profit improvement revealed by our analysis, why wouldn't Uber seek to exploit the same levers across its entire pool of over one million drivers in the US?" One Uber driver in New York state told BI he used to get more than 50% of fares when he drove for Uber. Since Uber introduced upfront pricing in his area, though, he has seen his cut — and, usually, his total pay from trips — fall, usually to less than 30% of the total fare. The driver shared screenshots and notes of payouts from his recent trips. The gap between what riders pay and what he makes becomes apparent when he strikes up conversations in his car. "They'll tell you that they paid Uber $60, and you're lucky if you get $20," the driver told BI. One of the clearest pieces of evidence for Uber's use of price discrimination came when Sherman compared his driver's rides from 2019 with those from 2024. In 2019, almost all of the driver's trips — 98% — had predictable pay based on distance, travel time, and any surge pricing that was in effect at the time. By 2024, though, that number had dropped to 77%, a sign that Uber had given itself "considerable wiggle room to maximize profits by adjusting prices and pay on every trip," Sherman wrote. The analysis focused on the driver's actual earnings and wasn't affected by fees, such as airport pickup fees, that drivers sometimes incur but Uber reimburses, Sherman said. Perhaps the biggest financial impact of Uber's upfront pricing, the study suggests, is on the percentage of each fare that the company claims — a metric known as "take rate." Uber doesn't regularly report its take rate in earnings. Sherman estimated it by comparing the rider price per mile in the data with the driver's pay. When upfront pricing began in 2022, the rides that Sherman's driver took had a take rate of about 32%. By the end of 2024, the take rate stood at about 42%. On some trips that Sherman examined, Uber took more than 50% of the fare. Sherman determined that the lack of transparency around pricing with the new model could have allowed Uber to increase take rates. How much Uber takes from each fare is a frequent topic of discussion for ride-hailing drivers and their passengers. "Drivers are obsessed with it," Sherman said. Determining how they're splitting a fare with Uber is an important factor for ride-hailing drivers who are deciding whether the job is worth it, said Sergio Avedian, an Uber driver who's a senior contributor to The Rideshare Guy, a gig driver advocacy blog and YouTube channel. "There is no other math," he said. Uber's upfront pricing also raised fares for short trips that the driver took, Sherman found. Longer trips, meanwhile, became a comparatively good deal for riders, which could have spurred riders to use Uber for longer trips instead of only quick hops around town, he said. "Uber's upfront pricing policy thus unlocked a trifecta of profit improvement: higher margins applied to higher-priced trips plus a shift to longer, more profitable trips," the report said.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo is seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia's stock hit a record high on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a "Golden Wave" of artificial intelligence. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose over 4 per cent to a record high of US$154.10. The rise sent Nvidia's stock market value to US$3.76 trillion, overtaking Microsoft, which was last valued at US$3.65 trillion following a 0.2 per cent increase in its stock. Fueling Nvidia's latest rally, Loop Capital lifted its price target for the designer of high-end AI processors to US$250 from US$175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand," Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote in a client note.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia’s growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January.

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls

Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Wall Street is growing even more bullish on Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares set fresh all-time highs Wednesday. In a note to clients Tuesday, Wells Fargo raised its price target to $585 from $565, representing a 19% premium over Microsoft's closing level Tuesday of $490.11—which was itself a record. The climb continued today, as Microsoft shares hit a record intraday level of $494.56 and closed at $492.27. The finish marked the tech titan's 12th record close in 17 June trading sessions. "We acknowledge shares are trading near historical highs, but think this is justified given its early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market," Wells Fargo said, adding, "We still see a bright future ahead for Microsoft." Wedbush was even more bullish Wednesday, raising its price target to $600 from $515. Microsoft has "a massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep" as enterprise clients deploy AI tools, analysts wrote. Wells Fargo and Wedbush are more bullish than average, but they're far from alone. All 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for Microsoft stock, with a mean price target of about $532.

Title: Netflix Should Invest in High-Value, Short-Form Content and Exclusive Creator Deals, Analyst Says

Time Published: 2025-06-25T16:57:34Z

Wells Fargo’s Steve Cahall says move would add subscribers, drive engagement, boost ads and better compete with YouTube and social media As Netflix aspires to reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall believes that the company’s next big investment should be high-value, short-form content and exclusive, multi-year deals with creators. He sees short-form video content as a potential third pillar of growth, along with sports and ads, that will broaden the streamer’s engagement, deepen its library of content, help the company navigate generational changes as engagement grows on TikTok, social media and user generated feeds on YouTube, and make a $1 trillion market cap aspiration feel possible. “Some of the bigger creators on YouTube have high production value content with huge, built-in audiences. Their annual viewing hours rival big Netflix originals,” Cahall, who raised the bank’s price target on Netflix stock from $1,222 to $1,500 per share, wrote in a research note. “Moving creators exclusively to NFLX could be an opportunity to add subscribers, engagement and ads, all at an attractive ROI.” Wells Fargo estimates that Netflix paid an average of $81 per 1,000 hours viewed on content in 2024, with top originals making an average of $132 per 1,000 hours viewed. In comparison, Cahall believes the company could pay top creators an average of $60 per 1,000 hours viewed. While Netflix has recently moved into live programming, Cahall argued that type of appointment viewing will “always be limited for a mostly on-demand service.” He pointed out that Netflix’s ramp up of live and sports content has been “very piecemeal and will likely remain so” due to most major sports rights being locked up between now and the end of the decade. Cahall’s call for Netflix to push into short-form video content comes as YouTube lead TV viewing for the fourth consecutive month in May with a 12.5% share, while Netflix trailed behind in second with a share of 7.5%. “We think short-form premium content that has helped YouTube track ahead of NFLX in US TV time (and potentially time per user) presents a unique opportunity for nearer term growth,” he said. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has previously knocked YouTube, arguing that it’s in the “killing time” business as opposed to the “spending time” business. He added that YouTube is a good platform for creators to “cut your teeth on” or develop an idea that can then be brought to Netflix where they would assume the financial risk. While Netflix has been focused on capturing the share of TV watching that’s not on its platform nor YouTube, Sarandos has said the company is competing with the Alphabet-owned video platform for the chunk of viewing geared towards “professional content.” In order to reach its $1 trillion market cap goal, Netflix is looking to double its revenue to $78 billion and triple its operating income to around $30 billion by 2030. It’s also eyeing about 410 million subscribers and roughly $9 billion in global ad sales by 2030, according to figures leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Outside of its content, Netflix has expressed an interest in adding video podcasts to the platform. The company is also targeting a late 2025 opening for its Netflix Houses in Pennsylvania and Dallas, with a third location opening on the Las Vegas Strip in 2027, which will offer live immersive experiences based on its popular programming, a theater to watch movies and shows on the big screen, shopping and dining. Shares of Netflix have climbed 90% in the past year and 44% year to date.

The 10 models are the first to be added to CAIS's recently launched Models Marketplace and feature substantial exposure to private markets. June 25, 2025 Alternative investment platform CAIS unveiled the first investment models to be added to its recently launched CAIS Models Marketplace. The new line-up includes multi-asset model portfolios, three each from BlackRock, Carlyle and KKR, and one multi-asset, multi-manager model from Franklin Templeton. The announcement comes amid a boom in model portfolio adoption across the RIA universe. As financial advisors increasingly look for model portfolios with private market exposure, both asset managers and various investment platforms are rushing to meet the demand. For example, last week, wealth management platform Envestnet revealed it was adding models with private market exposure options from Fidelity, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. Last year, alternative investment platform iCapital launched its first model portfolio, with access to private equity, private credit and real assets. BlackRock’s models will combine exposure to public and private markets with allocations to public equities, public debt, private equity and private credit through select BlackRock investment vehicles. The assets in the model will run across the risk spectrum. Carlyle’s models will target private equity and private credit, focusing on enhanced returns, supplemental income and capital preservation. Related:RIAs and the Evolving Landscape of Private Wealth KKR’s models will allocate to private equity, private credit, private real estate and private infrastructure. They will also focus on generating income, enhanced returns and capital preservation. Franklin Templeton’s model will invest in private markets, including private credit, private real estate, infrastructure, secondaries, co-investments and asset-backed finance. These investment options will be accessed through Alternatives by Franklin Templeton and select third-party partners. “Alternative investment models give advisors a powerful tool to deliver more personalized portfolios, while helping to streamline operational complexity and scale allocations,” said Neil Blundell, chief investment officer at CAIS Advisors and head of investments at CAIS, in a statement. “By packaging multiple alternative investment strategies into a single, professionally designed solution, advisors can focus more on their clients and less on manager selection.” Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

Title: What’s Next for Real-World Asset Tokenization

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has passed its proof-of-concept phase. With over $20 billion in tokenized assets and institutional momentum from top-tier asset issuers such as Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, KKR and VanEck, among others, on-chain finance is no longer hypothetical. But the road ahead — powered by rapid infrastructure improvements and shifting market conditions — is where the real transformation begins. Here are the five key technological and five key market drivers shaping the next three years of tokenization: 1. Blockchain infrastructure maturityLayer 1s and layer 2s are scaling quickly, reducing fees and improving UX. Seamless wallet usage, account abstraction and lower gas costs will make holding tokenized assets frictionless for institutions and individuals alike. 2. Smart contract evolutionContracts are becoming safer, more composable and increasingly automated. Expect AI to assist in designing and auditing contracts that power yield, compliance and asset servicing — all with less manual oversight. 3. On-chain identity integrationWallet-linked KYC and decentralized identity protocols will streamline onboarding without sacrificing privacy, a critical breakthrough for institutional adoption and retail accessibility. 4. Institutional-grade custodyMPC wallets, recovery protocols and regulated custody options will resolve long-standing custody concerns — making tokenized assets truly investable at scale. 5. Regulated marketplaces & exchange integrationMore tokenized assets will trade on SEC-regulated ATS platforms and become available on-chain via compliant DEXs, driving liquidity and transparency across asset classes. 1. Regulatory clarityRegulators in the U.S., EU, and APAC are advancing frameworks for tokenized securities, stablecoins and DeFi. As clarity grows, so will institutional confidence. 2. Tokenized treasuries > stablecoinsTokenized T-bills (e.g. BUIDL, VBILL) are emerging as superior collateral and yield-bearing instruments — offering institutional-grade safety with better capital efficiency. 3. Stablecoins as global settlement layerWith $150B+ in circulation, stablecoins are evolving into programmable cash — enabling instant settlement, treasury funding and FX trades across blockchains. 4. Full asset class coveragePublic equities, private equity, bonds, credit, real estate and commodities are all heading on-chain. Tokenization is expanding from yield products to the full capital stack. 5. Institutional & emerging market accelerationWall Street is actively piloting tokenization infrastructure, while emerging markets are leapfrogging legacy systems by going directly to blockchain rails. Conclusion The next phase of RWA tokenization will be driven by scalability, composability and credibility. Institutions are no longer asking if they should tokenize — but how fast they can do it. The result will be a 24/7, globally accessible financial system — built on trustless rails, powered by programmable assets.

Title: Loop Capital: NVIDIA (NVDA) Heading To A $6 Trillion Valuation

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We noted in a recent post that NVIDIA appears to have vanquished nearly all of its near-term bearish catalysts, prompting some hedge fund managers based in Boston to ask the rhetorical question: what is keeping the stock from breaking out? Now, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has joined this bullish chorus by pegging a street-high price target of $250 on NVIDIA shares, which implies a market capitalization of $6 trillion! Baruah then cites the math that "just works" to justify his unbridled enthusiasm vis-à-vis NVIDIA. According to Loop Capital's supply chain analyst John Donovan, the spending on GPUs could climb to $2 trillion by 2028, which would be equivalent to between 50 and 60 percent of total installed compute capacity. For context, GPUs account for just 15 percent of the global compute capacity today. This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has already disclosed that it earns between $40 billion and $50 billion in revenue from each GW of new AI infrastructure. According to UBS, assuming a conservative order pipeline of 20GW, this scenario would result in $1 trillion in revenue for NVIDIA. Coming back, Baruah believes that the upcoming next phase of NVIDIA's growth will be driven by hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centers, generative AI, and AI-based accelerated computing. Bear in mind that BofA's Vivek Arya is much more circumspect in his outlook for the overall AI market, expecting a global data center TAM of just around $1 trillion by 2030. As such, Loop Capital now expects NVIDIA to ship 6.5 million GPUs in the ongoing calendar year 2025, and 7.5 million in 2026, replete with an ASP of over $40,000. On the flip side, Baruah concedes the possibility that NVIDIA might realize these numbers and still not reach the stratospheric $6 trillion valuation, owing to a compression in its 30x P/E, which has been the norm for NVIDIA for the last 36 months or so. NVIDIA shares are up 3 percent at the time of writing and trading at the $152 price handle. So far this year, however, the stock is up just around 10 percent.

Title: SharpLink Gaming Boosts Crypto Treasury To 188,478 ETH, Becomes Largest Publicly Traded Ether Holder
URL: https://zycrypto.com/sharplink-gaming-boosts-crypto-treasury-to-188478-eth-becomes-largest-publicly-traded-ether-holder/

Minneapolis-based sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming added over $30 million in ETH to its treasury between June 16 and June 20, cementing its position as the largest publicly traded holder of Ether globally. SharpLink acquired 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513, boosting its treasury holdings to 188,478 Ether, or approximately $470 million based on the crypto’s price at the time. To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink is one of the increasing group of publicly traded companies that recently pivoted to add crypto to their corporate balance sheets, following the successful playbook of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Since the company is centered on Ethereum, it is the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt ETH as its core treasury reserve asset, aiming to offer shareholders exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap. Unlike Strategy, which typically just accumulates BTC, SharpLink has put its ETH to work. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto cache, earning 120 ETH in rewards. The firm also disclosed an ETH-per-share growth rate of roughly 19% during that period. “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,” said SharpLink Chairman of the Board, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin in a statement. ETH is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours amid a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. It is now trading at $2,419.38, which is below the average purchase price for SharpLink’s treasury buys. While SharpLink now claims the bragging right of being the biggest publicly traded holder of Ether globally, some entities are still holding more ETH. The Ethereum Foundation now holds 212,072 ETH ( valued at $514.59 million) in its treasury, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. Some crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, such as BlackRock, also hold a considerably bigger ETH stash, albeit on behalf of their clients. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF held roughly 1.7 million ETH as of June 25, worth around $4 billion.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon.com, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's iconic smile branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has already delivered impressive gains, rising over 150% from $85 levels in early 2023 to around $210 now. But what could propel the stock to double from current levels over the next few years? The answer lies in AWS and AI – the primary growth engine for Amazon. AWS remains Amazon’s most lucrative segment and the key catalyst for future stock appreciation. AWS revenue growth of 19% year-over-year in 2024 and 17% in Q1’25 was strong, and it is expected to remain in high teens in the near term. The artificial intelligence boom is driving accelerated demand for cloud computing services, with enterprises turning to AWS to leverage AI capabilities quickly. Separately, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Also, see – Should You Buy RKLB Stock At $33? Amazon is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure. In 2024, the company spent approximately $75 billion on capital expenditures, and CEO Andy Jassy expects this to exceed $100 billion in 2025. This substantial investment is largely driven by the increasing demands of generative AI. Recently, Amazon further underscored its commitment by announcing plans to invest $54 billion in the UK over the next three years. This investment aims to expand both its warehouse network and artificial intelligence infrastructure, bolstering its e-commerce and cloud operations. AWS revenue reached $108 billion in 2024, representing 17% of Amazon’s total revenues. However, the segment’s high margins establish it as Amazon’s primary profit driver. Continued double-digit growth in AWS could significantly increase the company’s overall valuation. For perspective, AWS alone accounted for an estimated 40% of Amazon’s total EBITDA in 2024. Wondering about Amazon’s profitability, check out – Amazon Operating Income Comparison and Amazon Operating Cash Flow Comparison Amazon’s AI investments create a multiplier effect across all business segments. In e-commerce, AI will help enhance recommendation engines, optimize logistics networks, and improve inventory management, driving higher conversion rates and operational efficiency. For advertising, AI will likely enable more precise targeting and dynamic pricing, increasing ad effectiveness and commanding premium rates. These cross-segment AI benefits compound revenue growth while reducing operational costs, creating a virtuous cycle of scaling revenues and expanding margins. Amazon's advertising business has become a significant revenue generator, hitting $56.2 billion in 2024, marking its first time exceeding $50 billion annually. This was a 20% increase year-over-year. The strong momentum continued into Q1 2025, with advertising revenue reaching $13.9 billion, a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Amazon's unique position as both a marketplace and a media platform gives its advertising business a significant advantage. The recent introduction of ads on Prime Video has expanded ad inventory, while the company's extensive e-commerce data offers powerful targeting capabilities for advertisers. While attention often focuses on AWS and advertising, Amazon's foundational e-commerce business remains a substantial revenue source. Last year, the online stores segment brought in $247 billion in annual revenue, accounting for 39% of Amazon's total business. This strong base provides consistent cash flow, enabling Amazon to fund growth investments in its higher-margin segments like AWS and advertising. For Amazon's stock to double, the company needs to show consistent growth across its key businesses. This growth will likely be fueled by AWS's AI-driven expansion, the rapid increase in advertising revenue, and the stability of its e-commerce operations. Key factors that could drive stock appreciation include AWS consistently growing above 20%, advertising revenue reaching $80-90 billion annually (expected within 2-3 years), and improved operating margins as AI investments start paying off. Amazon's substantial AI infrastructure investments strategically position it to capture a significant share of the emerging AI market. Looking at the numbers, we project Amazon’s revenues to exceed $900 billion in the next three years, with earnings nearly doubling from 2024 to over $10 per share. Currently, with AMZN stock trading around $210, it’s valued at approximately 39 times trailing earnings. If it maintains a similar valuation, the stock could surpass $400 within the next three years. Should investors assign an even higher multiple, it would imply more than a two-fold growth. Also see – Amazon’s Valuation Ratios Comparison Amazon’s diverse revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising offer multiple avenues for sustained growth. This revaluation, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides the basis for the stock to double, reflecting sustained revenue increases and a reassessment of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. Amazon's diversified revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising provide multiple pathways for sustained growth. If these segments continue their current trajectories, the stock could potentially double from here, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion as AI investments mature. The convergence of scaling revenues across all segments and improving profitability from AI-driven efficiencies could fuel significant investor optimism. As Amazon demonstrates its ability to monetize massive AI investments while maintaining market leadership, investors may assign premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology companies. This multiple expansion, combined with fundamental business growth, provides the mathematical foundation for the stock to double—requiring both sustained revenue increases and a revaluation of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. While Amazon’s pathway looks promising, several factors could hinder the stock from doubling. Intensifying competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, for example, could put pressure on AWS's margins and growth rates. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny over Amazon’s market dominance, especially in e-commerce and advertising, might lead to antitrust actions. These could limit expansion or even force business restructuring. Google and Meta are already facing the heat. The company's massive AI capital expenditures also carry execution risk; if these investments don't deliver expected returns or take too long to materialize, investor sentiment could turn negative. Additionally, economic downturns could reduce enterprise cloud spending and consumer e-commerce activity. Elevated interest rates could also make high-growth stocks like Amazon less appealing compared to fixed-income alternatives. Overall, investors willing to bet on Amazon should take into account these risks as well. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Agrochemical Giant Syngenta: Toxic Sustainability. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:28:25Z

Syngenta doesn’t sell sustainability. It sells the story of it. It’s one of the world’s largest agrochemical firms—born from the merger of Novartis and AstraZeneca’s agribusiness arms, now owned by ChemChina. It sells seeds, pesticides and promises. And increasingly, it sells itself as a climate solution. But this is not transformation. It’s rebranding. Syngenta’s model hasn’t changed. It still pushes chemical-intensive farming, proprietary hybrids and monoculture logic. What’s changed is the language: regenerative agriculture, climate smart, sustainable intensification. The poison is the same. Only the label is new. Take paraquat. A highly toxic herbicide linked to thousands of farmer poisonings and deaths across India. Banned in more than 50 countries. Still sold in India. Syngenta is one of its largest manufacturers. In 2020, India’s Ministry of Agriculture proposed banning paraquat, citing health risks and lack of antidote. But the ban never materialised. Industry lobbying, led in part by Syngenta and its affiliates, stalled the process. The company argued that paraquat was safe when used properly. Apparently, training, not prohibition, was the answer. The burden is shifted to the farmer. The chemical stays on the shelf. And the deaths continue. Syngenta now frames itself as a sustainability leader. Its corporate roadmap outlines four priorities: higher yields with lower impact, soil regeneration, rural prosperity and sustainable operations. It speaks of ‘regenerative agriculture’ and ‘nature-positive farming’. It partners with The Nature Conservancy and the World Economic Forum. But its core business remains unchanged. It still sells atrazine, banned in the EU. It still promotes hybrid seeds that require chemical support. It still pushes input-intensive models that degrade soil, reduce biodiversity and lock farmers into cycles of dependency. This is not regeneration. It’s reputation management. And it’s working. In India, Syngenta runs various corporate social responsibility programmes: rural market upgrades, solar electrification, youth training and water access. These projects are real. They improve lives. But they also serve a deeper function: to embed the company in rural communities, deflect criticism and secure social licence. A firm that sells paraquat also installs solar panels. A firm that promotes pesticide use also funds health camps. The contradiction is not resolved. It’s papered over. This is not corporate responsibility. It’s strategic philanthropy. And it’s expanding. The Green Revolution didn’t just change what farmers grew—it changed how they thought about farming. Syngenta’s model continues that legacy. It reframes farming as a chemical equation: inputs in, yields out. Syngenta’s ‘Good Growth Plan’ claims to train millions of farmers in sustainable practices. But these practices often revolve around safe pesticide use—not reducing dependency. The goal is not agroecology. It’s market expansion. And the state plays along. Syngenta partners with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) (India’s top body for agricultural research and education), state governments and international donors. It co-authors training manuals. It sits on advisory boards. It helps shape what counts as ‘best practice’. And it does so without scrutiny. It’s capture by invitation. And it narrows the future. Agroecological alternatives are framed as niche. Indigenous seeds are sidelined. Farmer-led innovation is ignored. The path forward is paved with proprietary inputs, digital compliance and climate branding. The farmer is told ‘adapt or be left behind’. Syngenta sells carbon credits, drought-tolerant hybrids and ‘climate-smart’ packages. It positions itself as part of a solution. But the solution looks a lot like the problem. The same firm that degrades soil now offers soil regeneration. The same firm that promotes monocultures now speaks of biodiversity. The same firm that lobbied against pesticide bans now funds sustainability summits. The future of food is being written by those who caused its crisis. Syngenta doesn’t just sell chemicals. It sells the idea that chemicals are inevitable. That farming without them is naïve. That sustainability means managing toxicity, not moving beyond it. But this is the enclosure of possibility—wrapped in the language of regeneration, delivered through partnerships and enforced by protocol. The agri biotech sector is engaged in a corporate hijack of agriculture while attempting to portray itself as being involved in some kind of service to humanity. A couple of years ago, Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald called for organic farming to be abandoned. He claimed rich countries had to increase their crop production—but organic farming led to lower yields. Fyrwald also called for gene editing to be at the heart of food policy in order to increase food production. He stated that people are starving due to organic agriculture. Writing on the GMWatch website, Jonathan Matthews responded by saying the conflict in Ukraine and food-related supply chain disruptions had emboldened Fyrwald’s scaremongering. In effect, Fyrwald’s comments reflected the industry’s determination to undermine the European Union’s Farm to Fork strategy, which aimed by 2030 not just to slash pesticide use by 50 per cent and fertiliser use by 20 per cent but to more than triple the percentage of EU farmland under organic management. Such goals represent an existential threat to the likes of Syngenta, which led to a carefully orchestrated attack on the EU strategy. Mathews quoted research that shows genetically engineered crops have no yield benefit and drive substantial increases in pesticide use. The newer and much-hyped gene-edited crops look set to do the same. Syngenta was among the corporations criticised by a 2017 UN report for “systematic denial of harms” and “unethical marketing tactics”. Selling highly hazardous pesticides is at the core of Syngenta’s business model. Fyrwald is far from an objective observer. He is compelled to promote corporate value capture, patents and market penetration while denigrating threats to profit margins. Bayer sells dependency, Amazon sells inevitability, Microsoft builds the stack, Gates builds the script, BlackRock governs through capital and so on. Each firm speaks a different dialect. But the grammar is the same. It is the grammar of control. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Joe Duffy’s Liveline highlights: From scammers to Normal People and banks to menopause, this was appointment radio

Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:07:51Z
Full Content:
Joe Duffy will host his final edition of Liveline on Friday, bringing the curtain down on one of the most popular and influential tenures in Irish radio history. Since taking over from the late Marian Finucane as presenter in 1999, Duffy has turned RTÉ Radio 1’s afternoon phone-in show into a phenomenon. Under Duffy’s stewardship, Liveline – with its famous tagline, “Talk to Joe” – could be a safe space for deeply personal stories, a chaotic small claims court and a crusading platform for social justice. As he hangs up his mic on the show, these 10 memorable moments highlight Duffy’s inimitable style, as well as his knack for capturing the public mood. An early indication of Duffy’s ability to stir listeners to action came in January 2001. Helen, a mother of autistic twins, phoned the show “in pure desperation” to describe her dire living conditions: her Wicklow house had been left unfinished by a builder who had scarpered, despite having been paid £25,000. “It’s just a nightmare,” she said, recounting how she had to cook Christmas dinner in her garage. Duffy appealed for help, the show was duly inundated with offers from tradesmen, and 101 days later, Helen – real name Catherine Doyle – was hosting both Duffy and President Mary McAleese in her newly rebuilt home. The legend of the Liveline effect was born. In hindsight, Duffy’s first decade at Liveline was wilder and more sensationalist than in later years, never more so than during the 2007 on-air barney between crime journalist Paul Williams and criminal Alan Bradley. The temperature really spiked when Duffy took a call from John Daly, an inmate at Portlaoise Prison, who accused Williams of stirring up a feud between himself and fellow Finglas native Bradley. “I can’t stay long, I’m in a cell,” said an agitated Daly. “Get off the phone you f***ing liar.” The episode prompted a clampdown on mobile phones in Irish jails. But it had a grim coda: Daly was murdered a few months after being released from prison. One of Liveline’s enduring strengths has been as a consumer watchdog, calling out shoddy customer service or – in the case of Mark Townley – serial conmen. In June 2008, Duffy heard several complaints about a Dublin-based model agency approaching teenage girls with bogus promises of a spot on an Irish version of reality show America’s Next Top Model – for a fee, naturally. Bangor native Townley, the agency’s boss, phoned in and brazenly defended his scam, while Duffy picked apart his guest’s murky past, before delivering a dramatic coup de grace: “I’m putting it to you straight now, and you can take me to the High Court on this – you are the Mark Townley that has been banned from entering England and Wales for two years.” Townley never sued: in a tragicomic twist, he was later imprisoned in England for threatening to kill Prince Harry. In September 2008, with the Celtic Tiger faltering, Liveline was flooded with calls from people anxiously withdrawing their money from banks and placing it in supposedly safer post office accounts: a postmaster spoke of queues out the door. Duffy knew reassurances from banks were falling on deaf ears: “Look at Lehman Brothers, look at Enron, Rusnak and AIB – the issue is trust,” he said, modestly adding, “I know I sound like Jimmy Stewart in It’s a Wonderful Life.” Then finance minister Brian Lenihan was so worried about Duffy’s potential to cause a run on the banks that he phoned RTÉ’s director-general Cathal Goan to complain. Days later, however, Lenihan issued the fateful bank guarantee, thus heralding Ireland’s great economic crash – something Duffy cannot be blamed for. But the host displayed his occasionally preternatural facility for taking the public pulse; as he later remarked, “The punters knew the banks were dodgy before the politicians did.” Down the years, Duffy has had many heartbreaking conversations with people suffering from grave medical conditions, from cancer patient Susie Long in the months before her passing in 2007, to the late Charlie Bird’s revelation of his motor neuron disease diagnosis in 2021. But few interviews had the immense empirical impact of Duffy’s 2009 interview with screenwriter Frank Deasy. A friend of the host, Deasy candidly spoke of his agonising wait for a liver transplant, likening it to “being on death row”. It was a sadly prophetic description: Deasy died only days later, during an operation to transplant his liver. But the effect of his brave account was spectacular. Within days, 15,000 people had applied for organ donor cards, with surely life-saving results. Once Duffy has a target in his sights, he can be relentless. This was certainly the case in 2010, when the host spearheaded a campaign against head shops selling so-called “legal highs”. For days on end, Duffy heard from people whose family members had suffered terrible effects after consuming psychoactive substances from the 100 stores across the country. One caller, Paul Hodkinson, recounted how his brother Colm died after taking magic mushrooms in 2005. Duffy’s unremitting campaign whipped up emotions, though not always to edifying effect, with pickets placed on some shops. But the public pressure yielded action. The government clamped down on the sale of legal highs, leading in turn to the closure of most head shops. A decade later, Duffy commented: “Our campaign to close down head shops was our best achievement.” Arguably Duffy’s most significant achievement, however, is his uncompromising and compassionate coverage of clerical abuse in Ireland. Following the 2009 publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports into sexual abuse in Catholic-run institutions, Duffy provided a sympathetic space for survivors to share their stories in raw, unfiltered fashion. In other hands, the deluge of abusive experiences could have been numbing, but Duffy handled the issue sensitively, with callers testifying to the traumas endured by vulnerable people in the Church’s care. Taking just one example, a caller named Maureen later recalled the harsh regime she endured in a Magdalene laundry, as well as the harrowing fate of her older brother at Artane Industrial School: “He was rented out to a bank manager for weekends.” Duffy has revisited the subject regularly ever since, whether allowing survivors to furiously decry the inadequacy of the mother and baby homes report in 2021, or, the following year, hearing how schoolboys sexually assaulted by priests at Blackrock College in the 1970s were shamed into silence by their clerical abusers: “They make you feel so ashamed, so guilty, it’s actually frightening.” In allowing survivors to find their voice, Duffy helped reveal the truth about one of Ireland’s most shameful chapters. A proud son of Ballyfermot, Duffy has never hidden his Dublin roots, given to sentimentally reminiscing with older callers about the city in the rare auld times. Equally, however, he has fulminated against the capital’s less attractive side, be it antisocial behaviour, street crime or, during an unforgettable 2015 rant, the city itself. Duffy declared Dublin “dead”, with shuttered landmark stores replaced by pound shops and fast food joints. “Dublin city centre is turning into an unadulterated kip, and nobody is shouting stop.” The possibility of such cranky outbursts ensured Liveline remained appointment radio for many throughout Duffy’s tenure. At the height of the first Covid lockdown in April 2020, between his signature pandemic-era exhortations to “washyourhands”, Duffy brought much-needed gaiety to the nation by hosting a riotous discussion on the TV series Normal People, complete with the classic Liveline elements of sex and religion. The host first heard genteel-sounding caller Mary voice her displeasure at the sexually explicit scenes in the small screen adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel. “I imagine it was like something you would expect to see in a porno movie,” Mary ventured. “What would you see in a porno movie, Mary?” replied Duffy, deploying his trademark sigh. (Mary didn’t know.) [ Normal People: Putting Sally Rooney’s novel on the small screenOpens in new window ] From there on, proceedings grew more entertainingly fractious, as a devout Christian named Tommy started railing against “fornication”, “the teaching of promiscuity” and, most unfortunately, “sluts”. The derogatory terminology aside, the captive audience was treated to a vintage episode. He can be hammy, tetchy and mawkish, as well as empathetic and engaging, but if Duffy has one defining characteristic as a broadcaster, it’s his capacity to hit upon and tease out the urgent conversations bubbling under the surface of Irish life. This was evident in May 2021 when the host spoke to Sallyanne Brady, who described the multitude of distressing effects of menopause on her health. Despite the fact that half the population will face menopause, Brady said, there was a silence on the matter: “I want a voice for these women.” Duffy soon noted that “the calls are coming in thick and fast”, and over the next two weeks women phoned in to share their experiences of menopause. Not for the first time, Duffy put a previously taboo subject firmly on the public agenda. That a male presenter should facilitate such a necessary conversation on women’s health probably says something about Irish society; but equally, Duffy was always adept at tapping into his audience’s concerns. People talked to Joe, after all. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc.

On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . .

Title: Remedy is in control

Time Published: 2025-06-25T12:38:15Z
Full Content:
Amid a bleak landscape, the studio behind Alan Wake has found a way to survive and grow, all while staying weird. In the quiet city of Espoo, a short drive west from Helsinki in Finland, is an unassuming building that’s home to one of the most confounding studios in games. Remedy Entertainment is known for getting weird. It started with the meta horror of Alan Wake, and has since expanded with Control, a game that turns a bureaucratic government office into a sinister and unsettling battleground. Their worlds merge the surreal and the mundane — which is not a bad description of Remedy itself. On the day I visited, the studio’s energy was relaxed and subdued — in true Finnish style, there are even multiple onsite saunas — and frankly a little boring, especially for a creative team known for the likes of the mind-bending Ashtray Maze or “Old Gods of Asgard” musical. But that contrast is also one of the keys to Remedy’s recent success. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the video game industry has experienced studio closures, persistent layoffs, corporate meddling, and ill-fated games that were canceled soon after launch. Exceptions like Remedy have been rare. Over the past decade, the studio has been implementing a plan to help it compete with bigger, better-funded developers and publishers, steadily inching its way from a work-for-hire studio to one in charge of its own destiny. As the industry has shifted toward live-service hits like Fortnite and blockbusters like Grand Theft Auto, Remedy has taken big swings with ambitious and delightfully strange narrative titles. Now it’s trying to expand even further with its first multiplayer — and self-published — game in FBC: Firebreak. The stakes are high: it’s the perfect example of Remedy’s new way of working and a proof of concept for its larger, more expansive future. It’s also a strange experience, marrying the surreal tone of Control with co-op play that bucks the latest online gaming trends. But to hear it from the Finnish developer, it only gets to take swings like Firebreak because it nailed all of the boring stuff first. “We are this building,” explains creative director Mikael Kasurinen. “This is it; this is us. We aren’t owned by anybody else, and I think that realization brings that culture of taking more responsibility. There is nothing above us that will save the day if things go wrong. It’s all on us.” This wasn’t the case for much of the studio’s existence. Founded in 1995, Remedy’s first release was a combat racing game called Death Rally. A few years later, the studio garnered widespread acclaim with 2001’s Max Payne, a hard-boiled noir with action ripped out of a John Woo movie. After a sequel, Remedy expanded in new directions with the survival horror game Alan Wake and sci-fi game / TV show hybrid Quantum Break. Despite its modest success, though, the studio found itself stuck in a cycle of working from game to game. It didn’t own any of its creations — instead, they were the property of publishers like Rockstar and Microsoft — and, with the exception of the rapid 18-month development of Max Payne 2, Remedy was only putting out new games every five years or so. That half-decade cycle meant that if any game failed, so did the company. This put Remedy in a precarious position, and it’s something Tero Virtala realized right away when he took over as CEO in 2016. “At that point Remedy had been around for 20 years, and succeeded in relation to many criteria,” Virtala says. That included releasing several hit games and steadily growing in headcount. But Virtala says that “it didn’t feel like enough” to have such a talented team and only release one game every four or five years. While it’s typical for games to take years to build, only having one project at a time left the studio vulnerable in case any of them flopped. Virtala helped spearhead a new path for Remedy’s future built on two pillars: One was becoming a multi-project studio, so that it was less dependent on any single game. Second, Remedy also wanted ownership of its original creations and to eventually become its own publisher. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it.” A major part of making this work was ensuring that everyone in the studio bought in and understood the plan, not just management. It sounds like a controversial idea and runs counter to the way the industry typically works: whereas most studios operate with clear lines dividing creative and business, Virtala believed that empowering developers to understand the business side meant they’d be better able to make the right decisions on the creative end. “People are smart,” Virtala says of his employees, “and they are mature enough to understand that if you want to make creative, ambitious games, it’s not possible unless you have the financial basis, unless you are aligned with the technology, unless you have the people and the production plans are in order. We try to provide the teams with as much information as possible. And then the teams are in the best place to try to figure out what is the best creative path within these constraints.” And it seems that the creative side has bought in. Sam Lake has been with Remedy for nearly its entire 30-year existence, starting out as a writer on Death Rally. (He’s also the face of the original Max Payne — literally.) He now serves as creative director and is the lead writer behind all of Remedy’s major franchises. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it,” Lake says. “When you’re creating a game concept, there are a lot of decisions being made, and the more you understand about what these decisions affect, the better you are prepared to choose wisely.” The real turning point came with the launch of Control in 2019, the first game released under Virtala’s leadership. While the idea for the story and world had been kicking around in Lake’s head for some time, the actual development happened as Virtala was implementing broader studio changes. He pushed for more efficient processes and timelines, hoping to make games faster without sacrificing the quality level Remedy had become known for. “Those three years were transformative for Remedy,” Kasurinen says. He notes that this new development style meant planning much more in advance on Control, and viewing limitations around budgets and timelines as creative challenges “that forced us to reinvent many things in a good way.” When it came out, Control exemplified exactly what the studio wanted to be: it was developed in a comparatively brisk three years, was a brand-new property that the studio would (eventually) own outright, and was in development alongside another project in collaboration with Korean publisher Smilegate. Creatively, it also allowed the team to attempt a new kind of open-ended action game and it opened up new directions for the future. Control’s success allowed this plan to continue. Since then, Remedy has steadily expanded. Control was followed by a long-awaited sequel to Alan Wake, and the studio has grown to 380 people. It currently has four projects in development: a sequel to Control, remakes of the Max Payne games, an unannounced title, and its first multiplayer game, the recently launched Control spinoff FBC: Firebreak. With the exception of Max Payne, which is being published by Rockstar, all of its in-development games are self-published. Remedy now also holds the publishing rights for Alan Wake (the sequel was originally published by Epic Games), and has created its own connected universe, which unites the worlds of Alan Wake and Control. In 2024 it partnered with Annapurna Pictures to potentially expand this even further through film and TV adaptations. Branching out into new genres and mediums is a further attempt to grow Remedy’s capabilities — and to better insulate itself from the volatile whims of the games industry. Getting to this moment required some structural changes. Remedy now has multiple development teams, with staff shifting between them as needed, and it also has a unique setup with two creative directors in Lake and Kasurinen. Lake says that both of them want to be hands-on when they’re leading a new game, and so having two people in the role allows the creative side to always be involved in larger studio decisions, even in the midst of an intense development process. “When I was deep into Alan Wake 2, I wasn’t a part of attending weekly management meetings,” Lake says. “I just needed to focus on [the game]. But it’s really important that we have the creative side represented on the company level. So this arrangement gives us flexibility. We can represent each other.” Even still, the transition wasn’t always smooth. As Remedy attempted to grow into a multi-project studio, not all of its expansion attempts worked out. First, the studio partnered with Smilegate on a new iteration of the popular military shooter Crossfire. The idea was that Smilegate would make the multiplayer portion of the game, while Remedy would craft a single-player story mode, giving the studio a chance to make its first first-person shooter. But CrossfireX was poorly received upon release in 2022 — campaign mode included — and shut down a year later. Remedy also attempted to get into the world of free-to-play games through a partnership with Tencent, but the title — known as Project Vanguard — eventually shifted to a premium release, before finally being canceled before it was ever shown to the public. Virtala says that these setbacks were largely a result of pushing too far too fast. And in the case of Vanguard, the failure helped the studio realize that four games at a time was the sweet spot for what the company could manage. “We started to feel that we had a bit too many projects for our size of organization,” he explains. “We saw that if we had a bit more focus, it would help our other projects to succeed.” But those failures don’t mean Remedy is done trying new things. In fact, the studio’s first fully self-published game, FBC: Firebreak, is also one of its most surprising releases. It’s a multiplayer shooter, which might sound like an odd release from a studio known for single-player narratives. But as the studio looked to expand, multiplayer was one of the key areas the team wanted to explore. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences.” Firebreak is a relative baby step in that direction. It’s connected to a popular game the studio owns, and it was built by a small internal team. While regular updates are planned — including “major” releases in the fall and winter — Firebreak isn’t a live-service game on par with Fortnite or Call of Duty, designed to keep players coming back with ongoing events and daily activities. It’s a paid game meant explicitly to “respect the player’s time.” It’s also a way for the studio to expand its capabilities without stretching the team too far. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences,” says Mike Kayatta, game director on Firebreak. “I like to think that we know what we’re doing when it comes to these large, single-player story-driven games. This is how the studio built its reputation and what it’s good at. When you’re faced with saying, ‘Hey, we need to diversify the types of experiences we’re making,’ do you really just want to just make five more of these linear, story-driven games?” So far, Firebreak’s release hasn’t gone exactly to plan. It was greeted with mixed reviews from critics and players, many of whom complained that, while it maintains some of the weird and unsettling tone as Control, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. But the studio seems intent on fixing things, recently posting an extensive list of patch notes and other upcoming changes that cover everything from the onboarding experience to the UI. “Several things have gone well,” the studio wrote. “Clearly, not everything has.” The success of a game like Firebreak is still critical for Remedy even under its multi-project structure. It’s a complex plan that has kept Virtala very busy over the last 10 years. In fact, when I spoke to him in an empty conference room at Remedy’s office, he was delayed because he had to prepare for the studio’s most recent financial report the next day. “Every single game is highly important for us,” Virtala says. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.” This feeling is only strengthened by the current realities of the gaming industry. It’s a space where even a well-funded EA studio can’t get a Black Panther game made, a Sony-backed multiplayer shooter in development for eight years, Concord, is quickly shuttered, and the likes of Netflix and Amazon are struggling to make headway despite huge investments. Remedy is currently in a good place, with a growing back catalog and multiple games in development, and while it has grown, it’s still a fraction of the size of most other studios making big-budget games, which often have headcounts in the thousands. While the last decade has been a big shift at Remedy, Lake describes his time at the studio as being filled with constant change, as the company steadily grew in terms of both staff and the scale of its projects. Even still, he believes that the current incarnation of the studio might be ideal for this multi-project structure, and says that he “would be surprised” if Remedy continued to grow significantly over the next few years. While many large studios are seemingly focused on perpetual growth, the team at Remedy is happy to be sustainable. “There were a couple of false starts trying to get there, but now it feels very much like we’re settled,” says Lake. “This is what Remedy is now.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Title: Trump Is Saying ‘Don’t Mess with This’ Stock

The following content is sponsored by Monument Traders Alliance and written by Karim Rahemtulla, the head fundamental tactician at Monument Traders Alliance. Let’s be clear: Donald Trump isn’t known for backing individual companies. But if you know anything about him, you’d realize he’s an “America First” protectionist at heart. And the truth is, Trump’s latest trade war means he’ll need to protect American companies from costly tariffs. And there’s one emerging energy company he’s backing personally. It didn’t take long for me to understand why. You see, this energy group is tapping into two of the most important forces shaping Trump’s “America First” future. Those forces are: Over the past few years, the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has been everywhere. Tech stocks like NVIDIA have become a household name. ChatGPT is changing the way we gather and communicate information. Plus, America is in an arms race with China, with former President Joe Biden signing the CHIPS act in 2022 to boost domestic tech production from companies like Intel and Micron. But aside from AI, there’s another side to the story – energy. While AI is growing at a rapid rate, it’s starving for energy. A single AI model can consume as much electricity as 100 U.S. homes during its training phase – and it’s only going to get worse. Even Elon Musk has raised alarm as well – saying we’re headed for a massive shortfall in electricity production if we don’t act fast. It’s rare that two major market forces combine, but this is one of those pivotal moments. On one hand, you’ve got AI – the single biggest transformative technology of our lifetime. On the other hand, you’ve got energy – the main resource to fuel that transformation. Combine the two and you have a complete system for: When I was researching the company, I was shocked at how strong its fundamentals were: Here are a few reasons why the energy group is not a household name yet. It’s in a “boring” sector. Wall Street and retail investors have been obsessed with tech and AI over the past few years. Meanwhile, energy prices have been ignored unless prices spike. Energy companies aren’t sexy like Nvidia or Tesla. So, it’s overlooked because of its sector. COVID caused some impairments. It took some write-downs and impairments in previous years, especially during COVID when demand cratered. While the company is crushing it now, those past scars have scared investor sentiment. It recently partnered with an AI company. This company recently partnered with another tech giant to squeeze more energy out of the ground, and more profitably and efficiently. But that partnership is still in its early stages, and investors haven’t caught on yet. When a President starts defending a company in the headlines, it means something big is brewing. And when a foreign government recently tried to pass a new tax to interfere with the group’s operations overseas, Trump stepped in with a fiery statement – directly calling out the move and telling them to reverse course. The fundamentals on this company are also the strongest I’ve seen in years, and since most investors haven’t caught on yet, I believe it’s still undervalued right now.

Title: Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi rollout faced bumps in the road
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robotaxi-austin-waymo-google-video-elon-musk-uber-stock-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-25T11:33:01Z
Full Content:
Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal. In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin. What's on deck Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience. Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on? Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore. But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin. The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections. The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor. The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions. While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as "Halo," involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said. The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk. At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits. Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000. Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion. 1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another. 2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying. 3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again. 1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US. 2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why. 3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable. 1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez. 2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly. 3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell presents semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee.

Title: BNY Eyes $3 Trillion Powerhouse With Northern Trust Deal

More is displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, showcasing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's real-time financial trends, stock price movements, market fluctuations, and developments in the global financial services and investment management sectors, on April 6, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) The custodial banking behemoth Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is considering a possible acquisition of Northern Trust, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. So, will a deal actually occur? Not at the moment. The CEOs of both companies have had discussions, but there has yet to be a formal proposal. A spokesperson for Northern Trust also stated that the company prefers to remain independent. However, should the two firms join forces, there are numerous potential advantages due to their significant presence in the asset-servicing arena; thus, the opportunity isn’t entirely closed, particularly if BNY presents a persuasive proposal. So why would this deal be advantageous for BNY? For BNY, the rationale is quite straightforward: larger scale, increased influence, and substantial cost efficiencies. Both companies provide comparable services such as asset protection, trade settlement, cash management, and wealth as well as asset management services. Merging with Northern Trust would produce an investment services powerhouse. BNY currently oversees $53 trillion in assets under custody, ranking as the world’s largest custodial bank. Collaborating with Northern Trust’s clientele and capabilities would significantly enhance the strength of the combined organization. The merged entity would control over $3 trillion in assets under management, enabling it to compete with asset-management titans like BlackRock and Vanguard. Additionally, there’s an efficiency component to consider. The merger could yield considerable cost synergies primarily through the consolidation of technological platforms, reducing overall workforce numbers, and minimizing redundant real estate holdings. Under the leadership of CEO Robin Vince, who has implemented a turnaround strategy that has boosted the company’s stock by almost 50% within the last year, BNY appears well-positioned to pursue this course. Furthermore, BNY’s financial performance has recently exceeded expectations. related: Is Neobank Chime Stock A Buy? Initially, Northern Trust must consent to a sale. After the initial report surfaced, the company asserted its commitment to remaining independent. Then there’s the matter of regulation. While the Trump administration is perceived as more welcoming to substantial mergers in the financial services sector, especially following the recent approval of the Discover-Capital One merger, BNY is recognized as a globally systemic bank, which may invite additional regulatory scrutiny. The leading positions of both companies in the custodian and asset servicing domains could also trigger antitrust issues. Shares of Bank of New York experienced a fall of about 2% during Monday’s trading session, suggesting that investors might not be entirely convinced about a potential deal. Investing in a singular stock involves inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 during the past 4 years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, demonstrating less volatility as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump’s accusations
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/25/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-on-how-he-shrugged-off-trumps-accusations/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T08:54:20Z
Full Content:
Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I’ve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America’s worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America’s best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to “stay strong, keep calm and carry on.” “I testified in Congress before I was CEO,” he says, “and was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‘there’s no way you should be CEO of this company.’ He didn’t think our company was any good or I was any good.” Flash forward a few years and that person was “a good colleague” on other issues. “I don’t hold grudges” quips Moynihan, “except as an Irish person for 100 years.” Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100—which he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. “You need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,” he says. “Some people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.” As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? “What you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you’re in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.” That’s a quality he hires for, too: “You’re looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,” he says. “When 210,000 team members look at you, they don’t want to see a person who’s going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can’t give energy.” You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com NATO on edge for Trump visit The president is in The Hague today for a top-level NATO meeting at which the military alliance is expected to confirm big increases in defense spending. On the way to the Netherlands, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.’s commitment to Article 5, the part of the NATO treaty that says if one member is attacked, all members must respond. “Depends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Trump shares DM from NATO chief The president also posted on social media an obsequious personal message from NATO chief Mark Rutte welcoming him to the meeting. It calls Trump “truly extraordinary” and says “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.” Read it here. Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were “obliterated.” Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding. Judge rules against Jony Ive and Sam Altman A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Ive and Altman’s io AI device venture, according to the FT. OpenAI was forced to take down a blog post announcing their deal because it may infringe upon a trademark established by iyO, a startup founded by Jason Rugolo, who is also pursuing a wearable AI device. Landmark AI copyright decision A U.S. District Judge has ruled that it was “fair use” for AI company Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted books. That is, as long as Anthropic purchased those books and didn’t pirate them. Powell talks to Congress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday that interest rates haven’t been lowered yet because the Fed predicts a “meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.” Powell notably declined to comment on President Trump’s policies during the Congressional hearing. Mamdani beats Cuomo in NYC mayoral primary Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist who wants to raise $10 billion by taxing businesses and the rich. CEO sentenced to prison for abuse of Rule 10b5-1 plan Former Ontrak CEO Terren Scott Peizer was given 42 months after a court found that his “safe harbor” stock sale plan had been set up to hide what amounted to insider sales.

Title: Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.

Time Published: 2025-06-25T06:30:00Z
Full Content:
These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “TITAN1” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “TITAN2,” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Title: InfraPartners Launches Advanced Research and Engineering Function

June 25, 2025 02:01 ET | Source: InfraPartners, LLC InfraPartners, LLC London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The research team unveils the new Upgradeable Data CenterTM in its first white paper London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 - InfraPartners, a leader in prefabricated AI data center solutions, today announced the launch of a new research function, InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering. Led by recent hire Bal Aujla, previously the Global Head of Innovation Labs at BlackRock, InfraPartners has assembled a team of experts based in Europe and the US to act as a go-to resource for AI innovation in the data center industry. The function will foster industry collaboration to provide forward-looking insights and thought leadership. Innovating the future of data centers AI demand is driving a surge in new global data center builds which are projected to triple by 2030. AI-specific infrastructure is expected to drive approximately 70% of this growth. Additionally, regulation, regionalization, and geopolitical shifts are reshaping infrastructure needs. As a result, operators are looking at new ways to meet these changes with solutions that deliver scale, schedule certainty, and accelerated time-to-value while improving sustainability and avoiding technology obsolescence. InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering will accelerate data center innovation by identifying and focusing on the biggest opportunities and challenges of this next wave of AI-driven growth. With plans for Gigawatts (GWs) of data center builds globally and projected investments reaching nearly $7 trillion, the impact of new innovation will be significant. Through partnerships with industry experts, regulators, and disruptive newcomers, the InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering team aims to foster a community where ideas and research can be shared to grow data center knowledge, capabilities, and opportunities. These efforts will aim to advance the digital infrastructure sector as a whole. “At InfraPartners, our new research function represents the deliberate convergence of expertise from across the AI and data center ecosystem. We’re bringing together professionals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds in artificial intelligence, data center architecture, power infrastructure, and capital allocation to address the evolving needs of AI and the significant value it can bring to the world” said Bal Aujla, Director, Head of Advanced Research and Engineering, InfraPartners. “This integrated team approach enables us to look at opportunities and challenges from end-to-end and across every layer of the stack. We’re no longer approaching digital infrastructure as a siloed engineering challenge. Instead, the new team will focus on the initiatives that have the most impact on transforming data center architecture and creating business value.” Ensuring access to the right insights As AI innovation and GPU roadmaps outpace traditional data center lifecycles and significantly change the design of sites, operators need access to insights and approaches which enable them to keep pace with rapid industry change. InfraPartners’ Advanced Research and Engineering team will support this by enabling the industry to build smarter, more adaptable infrastructure and improving outcomes for all stakeholders. A new approach to data center architecture: introducing the Upgradeable Data Center™ InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering has developed a new design philosophy that prioritizes flexibility, upgradeability, and rapid refresh cycles. Called the Upgradeable Data Center™, this design future-proofs data center investments and enables greater resilience and sustainability in a fast-changing digital landscape. “The Upgradeable Data Center™ reflects the fact data centers must now be built to evolve. In a world where GPU generations shift every 12–18 months and designs change significantly each time, it is no longer viable to build static infrastructure which has decade-long refresh cycles. Our design approach enables operators to deploy the latest GPUs and upgrade data center infrastructure in a seamless way” said Harqs Singh, Chief Technology Officer at InfraPartners. In its first white paper, ‘Data Centers Transforming at the pace of Technology change’, the team explores the rapid growth of AI workloads and its impact on digital infrastructure, including the thought-provoking GPU technology roadmap, increasing rack densities, and the implications for the modern data center. It highlights the economic risks and commercial opportunities emerging from these trends and introduces how the Upgradeable Data Center™ is enabling new data centers to transform at the pace of technology change. InfraPartners' model is to build 80% of the data center offsite and 20% onsite, helping address key industry challenges like skilled labor shortages and power constraints, whilst aligning infrastructure investment with business agility and long-term growth. About InfraPartners: InfraPartners is a global leader in digital infrastructure, delivering turnkey prefabricated data center solutions for AI workloads. The company’s standardized design process and offsite manufacturing offers greater schedule and cost certainty, plus rigorous quality control. With a core focus on sustainability and innovation, InfraPartners collaborates with hyperscalers, GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) providers, and government entities focused on sovereign AI to design and deploy scalable, energy-efficient data centers.

Title: Leaving Cert grinds industry: ‘Salaries scales for the top teachers can be 100 to 250 grand’

The final Leaving Cert exams are over – but another competition has been raging among grind schools where top teachers have been snapped for eye-watering salaries. The race is for a slice of a grinds industry estimated to be worth up to €60-80 million. Grinds360 is the newest competitor on the market, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. It describes itself as a “hybrid” service, combining an app which streams weekly grinds across 20 subjects, a Netflix-style catalogue of video lessons as well as in-person workshops at certain times of year. The cost, which has varied since its launch almost a year ago, is currently €1,399 a year. The company started out by poaching several teachers from rivals such as the Institute of Education and the smaller Dublin Academy of Education on huge salaries for the sector. The circumstances of one those cases – maths teacher Rob Browne, who left the Dublin Academy of Education to work for Grinds360 – was at the centre of a High Court row last September, which was subsequently struck out. Brendan Kavanagh, chairman and co-founder of Grinds360, says the firm started out hiring teachers from its competitors for key subjects like maths, English, Irish, sciences and business. The going rate to attract some of the top talen from its rivals initially was, he says, “anywhere from 100 to 250 grand”. “Are they worth 200 grand or 250 grand? For the hours they had to work – they were working six, seven days a week in day school and night school – I’d want that kind of money – especially for teaching!” Kavanagh laughs. At the online platform, he says, they are able to work fewer hours but play key roles in developing the future of the company. “It’s not really apples for apples. The more experienced grinds teachers are able to add a lot of value as we train other teachers throughout the country [who are now working for the company].” Some, he says, were also attracted by the idea of becoming involved in ownership of the firm. “If you earn that kind of money, you pay a lot of tax. So I think the opportunity for them to become stakeholders in the business ... created a new sort of environment there.” Subsequent teachers have been hired part-time, on different contracts, from various schools in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Roscommon. The result, he maintains, is that the company is making grinds “accessible and affordable” for students, while disrupting the “superstar teacher” narrative which he says has been pushed by some grind schools. “I’m off a few Christmas Card lists and I’ve been referred to as the Michael O’Leary of grinds. I’ll take it if making overpriced, over-glorified education finally compete on fairness, access, and transparency earns me that comparison,” he says. Nearly one year on from launch, Kavanagh says Grinds360 has seen “explosive growth” with more than 3,000 paying members and 18,000 app users. Backed by a €3.2 million seed round, he says the company is set to “double revenue” in 2025-2026 and claims the company has established itself as the “go-to alternative to traditional grind schools”. “The numbers speak for themselves – there’s a real hunger for a new model of academic support,” he says. Yet, business is also booming at the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street, which itself was a disruptive force in the education sector 57 years ago when it started the trend for exam-focused tuition. The institute was sold to a UK-based schools group, Dukes Education, in 2023 for just under €135 million. This year, the institute is forecasting a record enrolment of 1,700 full-time students in September across fourth, fifth and sixth year, with students paying annual fees of up to €11,000 a year. It also runs grinds, crash courses and online learning for up to 10,000 students attending other schools. Yvonne O’Toole says demand is growing not just for exam results but because students have “moved on” from single-sex, religious schools and uniforms by the time they are in senior cycle. While it lost some teachers to Grinds360, she says “crazy salaries” are not the norm, but that teachers are paid well on the basis that they are “expected to go above and beyond”. “They do a lot more hours ... there are extra classes – morning, evening – and they’re expected to be available. They put their heart and soul into it.” The institute’s main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It had about 350 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students last year and says it is on course to grow to 400 when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock in September. It expects numbers to grow to 500 in 2027 when it launches a fourth year offering. Founder Chris Lauder says while it also lost some teachers to Grinds360, it has “a deep squad” and was able to “march on”. The academy, he says, is always looking for top teaching talent. “What we used to do was ask our students if they knew of great teachers and surveyed them. Teachers also know other great teachers. And, these days, you also find them on social media,” he says. He questions whether some of the top salaries being mentioned are sustainable for the sector and insists the best teachers ultimately want to teach students in-person rather than online. “We pay more than what the public sector has to offer, and in some cases a lot more – maybe 50 per cent more,” he says. “Our teachers want to work for not just for remuneration; they like teaching students who are serious about academics. This is senior cycle only. They’re young adults, not children. They are driven – and they are a joy to teach.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Carl O'Brien is Education Editor of The Irish Times.

Title: Why did the US Army commission four technocrats as high-ranking military officers?

Full Content:
Four technocrats who are closely affiliated with Meta, Palantir, and OpenAI were just commissioned into the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonels, which I find to be extremely odd, and seriously concerning. Here’s the story, from a report at Task & Purpose: Four senior executives of tech giants like Meta and Palantir are being sworn into the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers at the unusually high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a new program to recruit private-sector experts to speed up tech adoption. For context, these Silicon Valley executives just skipped the entire enlisted rank structure (12 ascending positions), and four officer ranks, and jumped right to O-5. And, here are the four names: The Reserve’s new lieutenant colonels are Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer for Palantir; Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta; Kevin Weil, chief product officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former chief research officer for OpenAI. Since my mind immediately goes to scandal and conspiracy when I see the federal government cozying up to Big Tech (I’m engrossed in the news every day, can you blame me?), I quizzed a military friend trying to understand any reason why this might not be the nightmare it seems, wondering if I were overlooking or missing something. His conclusion was logical and simple: the only reason people are commissioned into the military is because they want to work within the military framework. I asked if it was because maybe their civilian status precludes them from being involved in sensitive tasks or missions? He replied no, noting that civilian consultants are a normal thing in the military, and then referenced Hillary Clinton who “never served a day in her life” but held a Top Secret SCI until very recently, when President Trump revoked it. And, these four men aren’t going to be officers in the traditional sense, as they’re exempt from standard military requirements: As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won’t need to complete the Army Fitness Test. So, why are top executives in Big Tech joining the military? Especially alarming is that all three tech firms, largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard, are known for being enemies to liberty and freedom. (I wrote on a disturbing development regarding Palantir here.) At least two of these technocrats are World Economic Forum elites—and now they’re leaders in our military? Is Sankar just a surrogate for Palantir’s Alex Karp? This doesn’t sit right with me at all. Image from Grok.

Total: 0.31 times (BSE data as at 3.54 pm) The credit growth of NBFCs which has trended above India’s GDP growth historically, is expected to continue to rise at a faster pace. NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term. - Master Capital Services Ltd With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months. SMIFS Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%. We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services. - Deven Choksey Research Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective. - BP WEALTH HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.28 times (BSE data as at 3.03 pm) HDBFS, a fast-growing subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is set for a ₹12,500cr IPO with a valuation of ~₹61,253cr at 3.9x P/B basis FY25 book value. Its strong presence in semi-urban and underbanked markets, diversified and expanding loan portfolio, advanced digital capabilities, and robust financial performance underscore its compelling long-term investment potential. - Aditya Birla Money Backed by strong parentage, AAA-rated credit profile, and an expanding footprint, A C Choksi Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. says HDB is positioned to leverage growth in underserved segments. However, challenges around rising NPAs, elevated credit costs, and subdued ROEs remain near-term watchpoints. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.24 times as at 2.21 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.24 times (BSE data as at 2.21 pm) Valuation: The company is valued at an FY25 P/B of 3.2x/3.4x at post\u0002issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively. The company is backed by strong parentage, brand, governance, risk management and a high credit rating. It is one of the largest NBFCs catering to the 2 nd largest customer franchise. The company is well placed to register healthy growth going ahead, while witnessing an improvement in the asset quality. SBI Securities recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue at the cut-off price. At the upper end of the price band, HDB is valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.01x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.72x. This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance. - Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition • Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. Among the defence index, Dynamatic Technologies and Cyient DLM traded with 1-3 per cent gains, while Data Patterns, GRSE, Paras Defence, BEL and Mazagon Dock depreciated 2-4 per cent.

HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.20 times as at 1.27 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand. Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective. Mehta Equities HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.17 times (BSE data as at 12.42 pm) We compare HDB with Bajaj Finance and also with other vehicle, MSME, Consumer financiers like Chola, M&M Finance, Shriram Finance and L&T Finance. HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlook Nirmal Bang Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion? The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business. Report by Piyush Shukla of businessline | Read more HDB Financial Services, an IPO-bound NBFC, operates independently from HDFC Bank, with an upcoming IPO on June 25. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.14 times as at 12.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.14 times (BSE data as at 12.03 pm) HDB’s IPO crystallises three critical trends in Indian finance. First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps. Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come At upper price band, IPO is priced at 3.2x FY25 P/BV post capital raise (V/s its close peer Chola Fin-5.5x) with 2.2% ROA. We recommend SUBSCRIBE for long term. Key risk: Regulatory overhang on overlap of business activities with the parent. - IDBI Capital The ₹12,500 crore HDB Financial Services IPO marks a pivotal moment for India’s NBFC sector – not just as the largest NBFC debut to date, but as a test case for how public markets value diversified lenders in an era of tightening regulations and evolving credit demand. Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.12 times as at 11.36 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.12 times (BSE data as at 11.36 am) We recommend to subscribe this IPO with long term view, as With its robust brand, varied loan portfolio, and wide distribution network, the company which is supported by HDFC Bank offers a great chance. With a focus on digital infrastructure and underbanked segments, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. Considering the company’s constant growth in its headline numbers and the recent rate cut by the RBI will improve liquidity and reduces borrowing costs, which will benefits the company. - Kunvarji Wealth Solutions JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Securities, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO. HDB Financial Services, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, has garnered Rs 3,369 crore from anchor investors, according to an update on the exchange. The anchor round saw participation from a host of investors such as domestic mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign entities, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website on Tuesday. Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI MF, Nippon India MF, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, APG Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, and Goldman Sachs have participated in the anchor round. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, British multinational Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, and Tata Investment Corporation, among others, have also been allotted shares in the anchor round. According to the circular, HDB Financial Services has allotted over 4.55 crore equity shares to 141 entities at Rs 740 per equity share, which is the upper end of the IPO price band, aggregating the transaction size to Rs 3,368.99 crore. Of the total equity share allocation to the anchor investors, the company has allocated nearly 1.94 crore shares to 22 domestic mutual funds that have applied for the public issue through 65 schemes, the circular said. PTI “HDB Financial Services Ltd. is India’s second largest and third-fastestgrowing NBFC franchise, serving 19.2 million customers as of March 31, 2025, with a CAGR of 25.45% over two years. Its growth is supported by financial inclusion initiatives, and it offers 13 lending products across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance, tailored by loan type, customer profile, tenure, and interest rate. They have built a pan-India hybrid presence, comprising over 1,771 physical branches across more than 1,170 towns and cities in 31 States and Union Territories as of March 31, 2025, supported by a digitally enabled distribution network through both in-house and third-party channels. They intend to further diversify their funding sources by expanding and strengthening their lender base, with the goal of optimising leverage and reducing the average cost of borrowings. At the upper price band, the company’s FY25 price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 3.7x, with a post-issue market capitalization of ₹6,13,879.4 million. Backed by the strong parentage of HDFC Bank, India’s second largest private bank by total assets, the company offers a well-diversified product portfolio with robust granularity, scale, and sound lending quality. We consider the IPO fairly valued and recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating.” Anand Rathi HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.08 times as at 10.48 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.08 times (BSE data as at 10.48 am) HDB Financial Limited IPO: We recommend a SUBSCRIBE rating to the issue, supported by: 1) A robust brand franchise and granular retail lending model, 2) A wide-reaching Omni-channel (phygital) distribution platform, and 3) Access to low-cost funding anchored by a AAA-rated credit profile. - Centrum Broking Sharekhan IPO report mentions, HDB Financial Services is valued at an FY25 price-to-book ratio of ~3.2x/~3.4x at post-issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively, which is reasonable as compared to its peers considering the growth and return ratio profile. “Strong parentage and much smaller in size as compared its core peer (Bajaj Finance) provides a long runway for growth. Additionally, favourable macro environment will act as tailwind for the sector in the near to medium term. We expect healthy listing gains and remain assertive from a medium to long-term perspective.” ❑ Asset Quality: High exposure to unsecured loans and MSMEs increases the risk of defaults, especially during economic stress. ❑ Geographic Concentration: Over 80% of branches are in semi-urban/rural areas, which may be more vulnerable to economic or monsoon-related disruptions. ❑ Liquidity & Interest Rate Risk: As an NBFC, HDB relies on borrowed funds. Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day. The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times. QIBs were NIL. Influx Healthtech stock traded flat on NSE Emerge at ₹132.20 as at 10.11 am after listing at ₹132.50, a premium of 38% against the issue price of ₹96. Arisinfra Solutions stock rose 1.55% on the NSE to ₹208.18 as at 10.09 am after listing at ₹205, a 7.65% discount from the IPO price of ₹222. Valuation: HFSL is the seventh largest leading, diversified retail-focused NBFC in India in terms of the size of total gross loan. The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns. Although the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by its strong brand and expanding customer base, considering the near-term operational challenges, we recommend a “Subscribe For Long Term” rating for this issue -Choice Broking India’s largest NBFC public issue, HDB Financial Services, will hit the primary market today at a price band ₹700-740 a share.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, raising hopes for a more sustained drawdown in hostilities. Investors also kept an eye on Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that the central bank intends to maintain interest rates at their current levels until there is more clarity on tariff policy and its potential economic impact, despite the White House's calls for immediate rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, closing just beneath its record-high level set in February. The Dow was up 1.2%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4%. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., skyrocketed 12.1% on Tuesday to secure the S&P 500's top performance. Analysts at the research firm Benchmark lifted their price target on Coinbase stock, pointing to favorable legislative and regulatory developments and the company's initiatives to capitalize on them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the department would launch a massive advertising campaign to encourage the use of wearable health devices. Kennedy specifically mentioned the benefits of glucose monitors for patients managing diabetes. Shares of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom (DXCM) surged 9.7%. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 7.5% as the ridesharing company debuted its robotaxi service in Atlanta. Uber's partnership with Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), initially offers service in 65 square miles of Atlanta, around half the city's footprint. Carnival Corporation (CCL) posted better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter, and the cruise operator's shares sailed 6.9% higher. The company also boosted its full-year profit outlook, pointing to increases in passengers carried and passenger cruise days as well as declining costs. Shares of competitors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) also advanced. AutoZone (AZO) shares dropped 3.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, following reports that a senior vice president at the auto parts retailer had sold a stake in the company worth more than $2.5 million. Investors often view large sales by company insiders as a negative signal for a stock. Crude oil futures tumbled as optimism around de-escalation in the Middle East helped alleviate potential supply concerns. Shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) fell 3.3%, while Exxon Mobil shares (XOM) were down 3%. The potential for calming geopolitical tensions also pressured defense stocks. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dropped 3.2%, while shares of aerospace and defense peers RTX Corp. (RTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) also traded lower.

Title: Stocks Near All-Time High as Oil Prices Tumble

US stocks climbed near their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel's war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Tuesday and got back within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices fell roughly 6% and are below where they were before the Israel-Iran conflict began, the AP reports. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, says Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious. He said again in testimony delivered to Congress Tuesday that the Fed is "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." But he did indicate the next move is likely to be a cut. Asked whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, "We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later—but I wouldn't want to point to a particular meeting."

On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after delivering a much stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it's seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000.

Title: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tanev Says Retail Investors Unfazed by Middle East Tensions, Still Heavy in AI, Crypto, Fintech and More

The CEO of the world’s biggest retail trading platform says that everyday investors are doubling down on their bets despite tensions in the Middle East and other geopolitical uncertainty. In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says retail traders appear to be taking the recent uncertainty as an opportunity to continue buying the familiar names they had already accumulated in the past, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and crypto-related equities. “I was a little bit surprised that over the weekend, when all this was happening, the markets didn’t move so much in the overnight. I don’t know if you were surprised by that, but I feel like if this had happened a year or two years ago, we would have had a huge move, but markets were flat to even a little bit up. And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Besides the top ten biggest stocks, Tanev also says there’s been interest in stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), telehealth company Hims and Hers (HIMS), and oil futures. “There’s been a lot of interest in Circle (CRCL), I think that [Hims and Hers (HIMS)] had a big move yesterday – when you have a big move like that around news, you always have retail and institutional jumping in – so I wouldn’t say it’s just the top ten, there’s new things coming all the time, and now we have futures trading, so we did see some heightened activity around crude oil. But the futures traders have always been trading that, so I would say, broad-based equities and crypto, it’s pretty similar to how it was last week. High volumes, but no huge shifts as a result of the conflict.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: This is how over 40% of NYC bookstores became unionized.

Time Published: 2025-06-24T17:53:53Z

The books world has been full of labor action in the last few years, most recently with Quirk Books voting to form a union with the NewsGuild and Abrams Books winning their vote to form a union with the UAW. Bookstores have especially been at the forefront of this push to organize. On May Day, I went to an event at Verso’s offices featuring unionized booksellers talking about their work and their organizing. One fact jumped out at me: over 40% of all bookstores in New York City are unionized, which is four times the nation average. That 40% is likely about to be even higher with the news that The Center for Fiction just won voluntary union recognition. How did bookstores in New York get to such a high union density? I spoke to five bookstore workers in NYC about their experiences organizing, how COVID changed the perceptions of their work, and how they find inspiration in each others’ struggles. Thanks to Aaron, Pilar, Henri, Joe, and Maritza for taking the time to talk to me. Their responses, which were so in depth and thoughtful, have been edited for length and clarity. Aaron Lascano, shop steward, writer, game designer, and Senior Bookseller at Barnes & Noble Union Square, RWDSU Maria Pilar Beddall, bookseller at Book Culture, with RWDSU Henri Seguin, bookseller at The Center for Fiction, RWDSU Joe Gross, poet and Lead Visual Merchandiser at The Strand, UAW Local 2179 Maritza Montañez, improviser and buyer at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, RWDSU AARON: I wanted to organize a union at Barnes & Noble because every single one of my coworkers deserved to be treated and paid better … workers at other companies like Amazon and Starbucks had begun their own union campaigns to win better pay and working conditions. They showed us the path forward—the only way to regain power in the workplace and to bring your employer to the bargaining table is to unionize. HENRI: I had been asking around about a union because I came from Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. (Editor’s note: They started their own union!) Elliot Bay had this really wonderful structure they had started during COVID and fought for during that crazy time. So they were just total seasoned veterans of union work and the benefits that it brought to the space … So I came in [to The Center for Fiction] very eager and with some backgrounds in that work. And then getting into the Center, it was lot different than I expected. It’s not just a bookstore, it’s also a cafe, and it’s also a nonprofit. And so although it’s a small organization, I saw a lot of the same issues as at Elliott Bay … And then there was a big renegotiating of contracts at the end of the year. A lot of shuffling around that—you know, I can’t totally speak to everyone’s experience—but my own, I was told one thing and then didn’t get that in terms of pay … It was a big upset and we started discussing how to fix this, and how the Center can work in the long term, because it just didn’t feel, without the union, like it had longevity in the system. So we saw [the union] as a tonic to fix these structural issues. PILAR: We need unions, we have always needed unions, without them we have no real chance of a better, more just future. MARITZA: Most of my extended family has spent decades in physically demanding jobs, and many of their hardest jobs as migrant or seasonal farm workers offered the fewest protections. I took their stories to heart and cared about worker rights sort of implicitly. I didn’t anticipate organizing myself, but working in retail changed me a lot and made me more comfortable talking to people, including my coworkers. Eventually it became clear that we wanted similar things from our jobs, and that it would be safest to advocate for ourselves with formal union protections. JOE: In short, non-union life is no kind of life. AARON: I think I talked a lot about a union as stability. A union contract sets pay and certain policies clearly, meaning you’re no longer at the whims of management. You can bargain out policies to protect people in case of layoffs or store closure (which we did), you can bargain for more safety training and a clear banning policy (which we did). Without a union, we felt like bookselling wasn’t a job you could depend on for more than a year. JOE: We talked about precarity. We talked about being the lowest paid unionized booksellers in the city, which had become common knowledge inside and outside the shop as people who worked or applied to work at other shops filtered through. …We talked about how many of us worked two jobs or picked up freelance assignments to make ends meet. A bargaining committee member who wanted to continue working at The Strand but couldn’t afford to left the store early in negotiations and returned home—we talked about that. MARITZA: Our earliest conversations were casual in tone, validating, and a huge relief. One of my coworkers got a handful of BIPOC booksellers she trusted from both stores to join a Zoom after her last day at the store, and we essentially had a three-hour venting session as our first meeting. After that, our meetings got much more structured but it felt very much like we were looking out for one another and trying to make meetings as easy as possible to attend. PILAR: Because we need to! The threat of Bezos, and the more existential threats posed by capitalism and the government mean that the interests of booksellers and the literal work of book selling is more important than ever. And probably in the face of Trump and everything else, owners and bosses seem much less formidable. JOE: My longtime friend since elementary school, Aaron Lascano, was working at Barnes & Noble Union Square and helping to negotiate his bargaining unit’s first contract while I was assisting with Strand workers’ contract renegotiations, and of course we spoke to each other about our various victories and defeats until eventually we got members of our bargaining committees into a room together and began trading information. We showed up for each other’s rallies and pickets where we could, and RWDSU research…confirmed our suspicions that Strand workers were earning less than any other unionized booksellers in the city. The big takeaway from their reporting, though, was that upwards of 40% of all book shops in NYC were unionized, which is extremely high for any industry and opens a world of possibility in terms of contract alignment, the creation of industry-wide standards, and a base from which to organize related industries. AARON: I think that part of it has to do with the types of workers that bookstores draw. There are plenty of students working at my shop, but there are also a lot of working artists (writers, actors, etc.), as well as people who have previously held unionized jobs as mail carriers, truck drivers, and teachers … We also are kind of in a bookstore resurgence–in NYC, B&N is really coming back, but the smaller stores are seeing it too. So we’re working harder days, moving more product and talking to more people, and we’re not seeing our pay rise with the rise in sales and work unless we unionize. HENRI: Bookstores and the larger literary world is an industry of passion and personal interest. It’s very easy to gloss over a lot of issues because you’re sharing your love of literature, and of books, and you have a community of like-minded people around you. But the thing about COVID is that it really stripped us down to “oh, no, it’s a service industry job.” It’s minimum wage, you’re under the heel of a lot of pressures, and you don’t have a lot of agency when it came down to it… you’re doing something you love, but you’re not treated in a loving manner. MARITZA: It almost feels cliche to say, but I really do think the pandemic pushed a lot of people to act on their values. The economy and our industry shut down and stripped away some of the biggest perks that come with bookselling and left a lot of booksellers with just the toughest parts of our jobs. I think a lot of us had similar experiences: we lost the higher paying jobs and gigs that subsidized our low bookseller wages, and we either risked our health for low wages or got laid off by employers who received PPP loans. Many of my newer coworkers came from other industries that also got shaken up by the pandemic and were surprised by conditions so many booksellers accepted as industry standards, and that really reframed our expectations as well. JOE: And we read. Anyone who reads history knows the only reason any workers anywhere have any sort of rights is because past workers formed unions, and radical, militant ones at that. AARON: I was most surprised by how quickly people were willing to step up. Bargaining took about a year and half, and in that time, we had a lot of different people volunteer their time to help run the union. Even as new people got hired at B&N, they’d immediately get involved by coming to bargaining and making time to meet with the committee. Keeping any shop organized is difficult and time consuming, and it can only be done if workers step up to make it happen. JOE: Organizing tests whether you’ll show up for something that’s possible but not yet probable, and every one of my comrades did. MARITZA: I was anxious about talking to people who might think bookselling is too easy a job to organize, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many workers in other industries immediately understand that bookselling is worth unionizing. More and more people agree that workers benefit from unions regardless of what industry they work in. HENRI: It’s been really encouraging to see the different workers and my colleagues step up in really encouraging ways. You know someone through their function at work, but the union work has really broadened that perspective. I’ve seen my colleagues and now my friends stay up late,wake up super early, plan all sorts of sort of contingencies and write drafts letters. And to see that work was a reflection of our commitment to The Center and its mission, it just makes the workspace feel a lot more purpose driven and inviting. AARON: I’ve been inspired by the progress we’ve made as a unionized industry. In NYC, the RWDSU now covers B&N, McNally Jackson, Book Culture, and Greenlight. I’ve started organizing meetings with shop stewards from those stores and also Strand (covered by the UAW), so we can begin having conversations about building a new standard. I firmly believe that, if unions are to really make headway and regain power in this country, they need to provide a robust vision for working people. It can’t just be about raises, it has to be about reclaiming power, reclaiming dignity, reclaiming time from our jobs. And to get there, to really get contracts that can change people’s lives, unions have to link arms and act in concert with one another. We have to bargain together, picket together, and strike together. We have to re-learn what solidarity means and how to effectively perform solidarity. JOE: So many people showed up for us when our negotiations stalled and we went on strike: the patrons who boycotted the store, comrades from Alamo Drafthouse, Cinema Village, and Nitehawk Cinemas who are currently negotiating their own contracts, comrades from UAW Region 9A and UAWD, comrades from the RWDSU, and socialist elected officials from across the city including Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. I’m grateful, and I think people are realizing the existential importance of organizing outside traditional political structures, and unions are key to providing alternative avenues of engagement. Unions should not be siloed in singular shops. They are political vehicles, and the most obvious ones at that. MARITZA: It’s been inspiring to recognize that we’re part of a larger labor movement. The organizer who worked most closely with us at Greenlight also worked with Amazon workers in Bessemer, and that was humbling for me. I am sappy so the things that most inspire me are hearing my coworkers advocate for each other or praise each others’ work. I also love little and tangible things, like so many of my coworkers got new and long-overdue glasses after our first contract because the company agreed to a vision plan for part-timers, and that felt like a small but important and immediately actionable win. MARITZA: My advice is to do it! And more specifically: make space for your coworkers to talk. Not everyone is comfortable complaining about work, especially at work– give your coworkers a safe place to talk, maybe on Zoom or some bar where their complaints won’t be overheard by the wrong people at the wrong time. Then give people some grace while you find common ground. Very practically, I’d recommend researching similar workplaces that have unions and find a contact there to start walking you through what you need to do (and stress that you want to be discreet). If you’re in an industry that hasn’t historically had many unions, think about what the day-to-day of your work looks like, and see if there are parallels in another industry. AARON: Before I started my own journey, all I could think about was how much better my coworkers deserved. I knew that we could and would win this campaign, that we could and would improve our lives. But I didn’t anticipate how our campaign would ripple outwards. The militancy of the B&N campaign, which involved actions including delegations, practice pickets, and a couple of walkouts, made conditions more favorable for other union campaigns to push back against their bosses. We rallied and picketed with Strand, took note of the concessions their bosses made to them, and then the concessions our bosses made to us were noted by other bookstores that were re-negotiating their contracts. The work that we did at B&N Union Square, B&N Park Slope, B&N Upper West Side, Strand, etc., didn’t just improve our individual stores. It helped improve the lives of hundreds of workers around NYC. JOE: Talk about the shit that sucks. Don’t get any lofty ideas to start with; just complain to and commiserate with each other about every little and big way your job drains you and disrespects you and you’ll find that Baldwin quote about Dostoevsky proven true: your pain and heartache aren’t unprecedented in the history of the world and you share the path toward their alleviation. And never, under any circumstances, accept a tiered contract. PILAR: Do it, talk to each other, ask questions, reach out to members, and remember that no one has ever relinquished power willingly, even for things as small as better hours, or more holiday time. AARON: I am reading Roberto Bolaño’s Savage Detectives. I’m Latino, and I’ve been spending more time reading and thinking about Latino history, politics, and culture. I think Bolaño does an incredible job at capturing the fallout of American-backed coups and American imperialism in Latin America. PILAR: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. JOE: Andrei Platonov’s Chevengur, which is a novel of ardent ennui that follows the forays of the October Revolution into the expanse of the Russian steppe and the people navigating that horizon, the space between the joining of a fight that was always going on whether they acknowledged it or not and the future they hope to win from it. MARITZA: I’m currently reading Miriam Toews’ A Truce That Is Not Peace and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s Cursed Daughters. HENRI: One that I adored is this very strange book called One or Two by H.D. Everett. It’s [published] by Mandylion Press who highlight lost feminist and female writers, and this book is about a woman who, in order to lose weight, exorcises her body, and then that exorcised clump of weight that she loses gains sentience and haunts her. And it’s also probably the most beautiful book binding I’ve seen in a long time. It’s an absolutely gorgeous little book. AARON: Solidarity is altruism, faith, strength … You engage this fight not knowing where it will go, not knowing that you’ll succeed, but knowing that you have a moral obligation to stand with fellow workers… it begins with the basic understanding that our fight is one fight, and that an injury to any worker is an injury to every worker. HENRI: For me, solidarity is just very simply showing up when things get hard. Especially just across the nation, there’s been a lot of examples of moments where showing up is the hardest thing to do, but it is the most important thing. And I’ve seen it at The Center, which is really wonderful. I’ve seen workers who are at their limits reach out for help and people lift them up… it’s kind of banal, but I think at its core it’s just showing up when it’s hard. JOE: Solidarity is a full and complete commitment to causes that nominally are not your own because you realize that every human cause is of mortal importance when you live in the same time and space and can only affect a real reduction in suffering by collectively exerting the power of all peoples. Either everyone has unalienable rights or no one does. MARITZA: For me, solidarity means mutual support, a willingness to take risks for one another and protect one another, and a feeling of investment in each other’s well-being. PILAR: Solidarity means remembering that we are not alone in the struggle, that victories have been won before and will be won again, as long as we fight together.

June 24, 2025 13:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Oricom and E Ink Deliver Full Color Electronic Paper Signage to Create a Sustainable Advertising Medium

June 24, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: E Ink E Ink BILLERICA, Mass., June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- E Ink (8069.TW) the originator, pioneer, and global commercial leader in electronic paper (ePaper) technology, today announced, in collaboration with Oricom Co., Ltd., a vanguard in the Japan ad agency scene, the next-generation advertising medium via the Sustainable Board. Featuring E Ink’s most vivid color ePaper, Spectra TM 6, Oricom will produce the Sustainable Board as a new channel for advertisers, offering an unprecedented, environmentally conscious advertising method. The product is an innovative, sustainability-dedicated medium for companies using Oricom’s brand, Mirapale. While being conscious of energy consumption, it actively communicates sustainable priorities and initiatives. Sustainable Board is ultra-low-power digital signage that uses E Ink’s ePaper technology. E Ink’s Spectra 6 offers a wide viewing angle similar to paper and enables vivid color expression like a print-quality poster. Because it’s a reflective display that doesn’t use a backlight, it achieves especially high sunlight readability. Additionally, it only requires power when content is updated, and image content remains visible once displayed without consuming any energy. This allows for substantial energy savings compared to conventional displays. Moreover, signage products equipped with E Ink’s ePaper, which boasts these features, can operate on batteries or renewable energy sources like solar. This makes it possible to choose their installation locations with more flexibility and mobility in mind. “We are very grateful to collaborate with Oricom, a leader in the advertising industry, in the electronic paper signage area,” said JM Hung, Vice President of Business Center at E Ink. “As we enter an era of global environmental preservation and environmentally conscious solutions are increasingly sought, our ePaper is a display technology that aligns with a more environmentally-friendly future. Through our collaboration with Oricom, we are confident we can contribute to advancing SDG activities in society.” Expected installation sites range from company receptions, lobbies, and showrooms to commercial facilities and tourist destinations. This product is recognized as a novel method that aligns corporate branding with environmental responsiveness by making sustainability tangible. Providing sustainable advertising mediums will generate a new market in the advertising industry. Oricom intends to promote broader Sustainable Development Goals by enabling companies and local governments to leverage this environmentally conscious advertising platform. “Amidst the expansion of corporate activities with a long-term vision, prioritizing environmental protection and social responsibility, advertising is similarly called upon to contribute from this perspective,” said Akemi Nakajima, President of Oricom. “We developed the Sustainable Board alongside E Ink as a specific method for this. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen the relationship between both companies, supporting corporate growth while contributing to realizing a sustainable society.” E Ink’s ePaper draws power only when the screen updates, and no energy-hungry backlight is required. This ultra-efficient, non-emissive design reduces both electricity use and carbon footprint versus paper or LCDs. Guided by its PESG (Product, Environment, Social, and Governance) framework, E Ink delivers low-carbon solutions that speed the world’s sustainable transition. FTSE Russell classifies 99.9 % of the company’s revenue as green, and Moody’s has confirmed E Ink’s loans align with global Green Loan Principles—clear proof of its industry-leading environmental performance. Installation trials at major stations in Japan are underway for Sustainable Board. The future goal is to expand into places with high advertising needs, such as commercial facilities. About E InkE Ink Holdings Inc. (8069.TWO), based on technology from MIT's Media Lab, provides an ideal display medium for applications spanning eReaders and eNotes, retail, home, hospital, transportation, logistics, and more, enabling customers to put displays in locations previously impossible.

Title: Broadcom, AMD Lead Chip Stocks Rally Tuesday

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and other semiconductor companies surged Tuesday, amid broader market gains as investors welcomed news of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. AMD stock was up 5% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Broadcom added 4%. Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) were also among the other chip stocks on the rise, boosting the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) over 3%. Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.

Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: High tariffs give Trump less room for error in Iran | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The US economy needs the fragile ceasefire President Donald Trump brokered in the Middle East to hold. If the pause in fighting between Israel and Iran fails and major hostilities resume, oil prices would likely spike again. And surging gasoline prices are the last thing the US economy needs right now. Inflation is already expected to heat up this summer because of Trump’s massive tariffs on imports. An oil shock would make matters worse — perhaps much worse. “It would be a bit of a double-whammy. First there’s the stagflationary shock from tariffs. And then a potential oil shock,” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University and a former top Federal Reserve official, told CNN in a phone interview. In many ways, Trump’s trade war gives him less margin for error in the Middle East. He can’t afford another world event that causes inflation to rear its ugly head again and further delays rate cuts from the Fed. “The economy is vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, and this certainly qualifies,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That’s why investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief in recent days. Stocks have popped and oil prices have plunged in one of the biggest sell-offs in years. Iran’s response to US strikes on nuclear sites was far more limited, and symbolic, than feared. Not only that, but the ceasefire between Israel and Iran eases fears that vital energy infrastructure in the region will get caught in the crossfire. The nightmare scenario had been that Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Analysts have warned that if this waterway shut down, oil prices could easily spike beyond $100 or $120 a barrel, causing a return of $4 to $4.50 gas in the US. As of Sunday, the odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz spiked to about 60% on prediction platform Polymarket. But by Tuesday, the odds plunged to just 17% as investors bet the worst in the Israel-Iran crisis may be over. Observers have noted that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be counterproductive for Iran, which relies on the waterway to get its own oil to customers, mostly in China. “They would be shooting themselves in the foot,” Blinder said, “but countries have been known to do that.” Critics of Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs warn that they will backfire, too. However, inflation has cooled in recent months even as Trump has lobbed tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and imports from most countries. Yet many economists say this is the calm before the storm, with tariff-fueled price hikes on the way. Some items exposed to tariffs like appliances, toys and electronics have already become more expensive. “In many ways, the past few months may be transitory low inflation before the price effect of tariffs hit,” Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, told CNN in a phone interview. “No serious economist would look at inflationary trends and forecast they will exist into the future.” Unless tariffs get dramatically scaled back, Elliott said inflation is likely to heat up by 1% to 1.5% from current levels. “That’s not going to be acceptable for the Fed,” said Elliott. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance, telling lawmakers: “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” If the situation in the Middle East does turn south again, it would create a potential boost to energy prices. “It would be a tricky combination,” said Elliott, a former executive at hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates. Oil shocks can be very inflationary because energy prices feed in to many parts of the US economy. Not only that, but there can be a psychological effect given how closely Americans follow gas prices. And it’s only been three years since gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation skyrocketed to four-decade highs and the Fed was forced to put the fire out by dramatically lifting borrowing costs. “People look at prices at the pump as a litmus test for inflation broadly,” said Zandi, the Moody’s economist. For now, gas prices appear to have stabilized. The national average price of regular gas was flat at $3.22 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.13 a gallon when Israel attacked Iran earlier this month. However, it’s still lower than $3.45 a gallon a year ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted oil prices “bear watching” given the recent price swings from geopolitical events. “The pain of large increases in energy prices still weighs on consumer spending,” Hammack said, while noting that the US is less exposed to oil shocks than in the past. “Recent increases in oil prices pose an upside risk to the stability of inflation expectations.” The scars of $5 gasoline in 2022 loom large. For now, investors are hoping the ceasefire in the Middle East means there won’t be a repeat today. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. stocks rose toward their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel’s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, following up on big gains for stocks across Europe and Asia, after President Donald Trump said late Monday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a "complete and total ceasefire." The main measure of Wall Street's health is back within 0.8% of its record set in February after falling roughly 20% below during the spring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 507 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. The strongest action was again in the oil market, where a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6% to settle at $64.37. Brent crude, the international standard, had a similar drop. The fear throughout the Israel-Iran conflict has been that it could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would pump up prices for gasoline and hurt the global economy. Iran is a major producer of crude, and it could also try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world's daily oil needs passes on ships. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." Oil prices have dropped so much in the last two days that they’re below where they were before the fighting began nearly two weeks ago. With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates because they boost the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money to buy a car or build a factory. But they could also give inflation more fuel. That threat is why the Fed has been hesitant to cut rates this year after lowering them through the end of last year. The Fed has said repeatedly that it wants to wait and see how much Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation before committing to its next move. So far, the economy seems to be holding up OK, though a report on confidence among U.S. consumers came in weaker than economists expected on Tuesday, and inflation has remained only a bit above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pushing loudly for more cuts to rates. And two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they may consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next meeting next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains more cautious, though he he did indicate Tuesday that the Fed's next move is likely to be a cut. Asked during testimony before a Congressional committee whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, “We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later – but I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” That helped Treasury yields ease in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.34% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.81% from 3.84%. On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after the cruise operator delivered a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it’s seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000. All told, the S&P 500 rose 67.01 points to 6,092.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 507.24 to 43,089.02, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 281.56 to 19,912.53. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied at least 1% everywhere from France to Germany to Japan following the announcement of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Hong Kong’s jump of 2.1% and South Korea’s leap of 3% were two of the strongest moves. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Higher Market Volatility Shines a Light on Buffer ETFs

Advisor usage of the products had been on the rise even before the recent tumult, and the new wave of uncertainty has only fueled that growth. June 24, 2025 Markets are facing a fresh round of uncertainty with the United States striking Iranian targets over the weekend and Iran retaliating by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Questions loom about the potential for spiking oil prices as observers wait to see if tensions escalate or simmer down. It’s just the latest shock to markets this year. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and subsequent announcements have sent stocks and bonds whipsawing amid on-again, off-again developments. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) currently sits at about 20 and at one point in April reached 50—the highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Easily and efficiently maximizing returns while mitigating risk is the promise driving one of the biggest recent success stories in exchange-traded funds: Defined outcome ETFs. By buying and selling options on the underlying portfolio, like a structured product, these ETFs promise to let investors realize market gains while still getting protection when they fall. The tradeoff: Sacrificing some portion of those gains should the market climb higher than the pre-determined limit. The funds have grown from $5 billion in assets at the end of 2020 to $50 billion by 2025, according to Morningstar. In a recent report, BlackRock projected the space will reach $650 billion by 2030. Even institutional investors are buffing up their portfolios. In December, Bloomberg reported that the University of Connecticut’s endowment sold almost all of its hedge fund exposure in favor of the funds. Related:$6.5B RFG Advisory Launches Suite of Active ETFs “What’s really resonating is the certainty in the downside protection,” said Graham Day, executive vice president and CIO, with Innovator, the firm that launched the first buffer ETF in 2018. “The ability of bonds to protect is now a huge question mark. And so that’s starting to stir the pot more in terms of what advisors are using to manage risk.” Overall, more than 300 buffer ETFs are on the market. Two managers—Innovator and First Trust—still dominate the space, though others are competing by launching variations on the theme (i.e., Calamos has debuted Buffer crypto ETFs) or with lower fees (BlackRock’s funds cost slightly less than the average). Other managers jumping on the buffer ETF train include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, PGIM, Alliance Bernstein and Allianz. “For something that started as a niche product, now the largest asset managers are hopping into the game, which we would expect to drive down costs,” said Patrick Nerney, vice president, investments, with St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Dynasty Financial Partners. “But at the end of day, this is a complex product that requires a nuanced understanding.” Related:Retail Investors Power US ETF Flows Past $500B in 2025 Despite Macro Risks Providers offer a range of buffers, so advisors can choose what percentage of losses they are willing to tolerate and how much upside they are willing to forego. Downside protection can be as low as single-digit percentages or go all the way to 100%. The upside caps vary accordingly. More downside protection, less upside gains and vice versa. As ETFs, they easily fit into most advisor trading platforms and performance reporting tools. They require more handholding than plain-vanilla ETFs. They have fixed time spans—typically a year. Buffer ETFs tied to major stock indices tend to come in monthly flavors, while some newer ETFs offering protection on Bitcoin and other assets are issued quarterly. Investors can roll over into a new version at the end of the defined outcome period. Some try their hand at tactical plays—trading in or out may reduce the protections or, conversely, lock in early gains, but only if timed correctly. In addition, some providers now offer laddered products with blended exposures to provide time-based diversification and automatically roll over into new issuances annually. Related:Seven Must Reads for This Week (June 24, 2025) “The beauty of those is that you can hold them for the long term,” said Rob Kane, director of alternative investments with $285 billion AUM Commonwealth Financial Network. “We continue to see the evolution of trying to make these more of a strategic allocation in a portfolio … something that will be in a portfolio for the next 20 years.” More adventurous advisors use the funds as tactical investments, opportunistically moving in and out of the funds regardless of the time frame in the prospectus. For example, if an investor buys a defined outcome ETF with a 15% upside cap in one month for $100 and the market goes up 5%, they can opt to sell, enter a new buffer ETF, lock in their gains and reset their protection levels. “We do see tactical use where an investor sells if the cap is running out or they want to reset the protection level,” said Lan Anh Tran, a manager research analyst for Morningstar who tracks the sector. “There are people buying in after the buffer periods have started. So, there is some opportunistic investment. But the more common use case is to use these as a hedge. And they make more sense as laddered products.” Because of the options strategies, investors in these ETFs do not receive dividends. “The conversation we often have is, ‘Are you willing to forego dividends and returns in excess of a certain percentage in exchange for downside protection?’” said Curtis Congdon, president of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Md. “And for many clients who are approaching retirement or wanting to be more conservative, buffer ETFs give them a way to retain equity exposure while having less tail risk.” In addition, buffer ETFs carry higher fees than passive ETFs. Average expense ratios are in the 70 to 80 basis point range. “This category of buffers has not seen the fee compression that other categories of ETFs have,” said Mike Venuto, chief investment officer at Tidal, which advises asset managers on launching ETFs. “Our internal research says that it has an average expense ratio of 72 basis points. If you weigh by assets, it’s 65 basis points. That’s light years away from traditional ETFs. I can see why new issuers are drawn to them.” While recent volatility may have triggered some advisors to give the funds a fresh look, interest has been steadily building over time. In fact, in the year-to-date through the end of April, $5.6 billion flowed into the category, according to data from Morningstar Direct. During the first quarter, “we got about $368 million in inflows,” said Matt Kaufman, senior vice president and head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, which has a variety of defined outcome products, some offering 100% downside protection on the major stock indices as well as Bitcoin. “We see people who are buying new. We also see people selling out of old series, capturing gains and moving into other series to reset their starting points. People are using these exactly as we anticipated and expect them to.” Not everyone is a fan. In March, asset manager AQR Capital Management analyzed 99 ETFs using Morningstar data and found that the ETFs performed worse than passive funds tracking market indices coupled with investments in three-month Treasuries. The researchers argued that there are better ways for investors to hedge risk. That triggered a pair of responses from Vest, the subadvisor that builds First Trust’s buffer products. Vest President Jeff Chang questioned the dataset that AQR chose, which included both buffer and non-buffer ETFs. Chang also pointed out that evaluating buffer ETFs on returns misses the point since the products are not intended to beat the market, but to provide protection. Morningstar’s Jeffrey Ptak joined the debate on his Substack, posted shortly after another article he wrote on Morningstar’s site. Ptak said buffer ETFs, by and large, had delivered on their promises and found “the average dollar invested in buffer ETFs has exceeded the ETFs’ total returns, meaning investors have been able to achieve the potential outcomes advertised.” The buffer funds have weathered the initial COVID-19 market disruptions in 2020 and the wave of supply chain disruption and inflation that hammered 60/40 portfolios in 2022. “They did what they were supposed to do,” Innovator’s Day said. “Sometimes we are asked if these have been tested. In 2020, the VIX was at 70, and they did what they were supposed to do.” However, Jack Zhang, chief investment strategist, alternative investments, with Sequoia Financial, cautioned about how surrendering the upside, at the wrong time, is also a risk of the ETFs. “In the case of the COVID recovery, we essentially got many years of returns crammed into a short time period,” Zhang said. With a capped upside, investors can miss out on those kinds of substantial gains. “In times of crisis, they can provide benefits, but perhaps not as much as other asset classes. Over cycles, being diversified in stocks, bonds and alternatives gives you more of an all-weather approach. I think over the long-term horizon, that just works better than buffer ETFs.” “Our team moved a considerable portion of our client’s domestic and international equity exposure—almost 40%—into these products in February and late March,” said Phillip Knight, a managing director and partner with Americana Partners, a Houston-based wealth management firm with over $8.5 billion in assets under management. “We’re beyond glad that we made this move, but we’ve also found that using these types of tools in a portfolio model adds an element of optionality, and to maximize benefits for our clients, you need to closely monitor the P&Ls of each position.” “We tend to recommend them as a complement to a traditional stock and bond portfolio,” said Gary Quinzel, vice president, portfolio consulting with Minneapolis-based Wealth Enhancement, an RIA with about $100 billion in client assets. “Our dynamically-hedged equity building block portfolio aims to provide exposure to U.S. equities with less beta risk relative to the overall market. Investors can expect a smoother experience.” Wealth Enhancement uses a variety of buffer ETFs diversified by buffer ranges and time periods. Depending on the client, it recommends allocating 10% to 25% of portfolios to the products. “We like to combine the different strategies so we’re hedged against time periods as well as potential downfalls. The end result, if done optimally, is that it can lower beta in a portfolio by 30% to 50%.” Brent Coggins, chief investment officer with Triad Wealth Partners, a Lawrence, Kan.-based RIA with $460 million in AUM, outlined a similar philosophy. “If you look at our investment platform, you will see a bit of everything,” Coggins said. “We have strategies that use the full principal protection outcomes, all the way up to more aggressive, high-single digit protection levels that may have a levered upside. It’s very much case-by-case and all anchored back to identifying the strategy that’s going to maximize the success for the client’s financial plan.” They can be particularly good fits for clients who are more concerned about principal protection than about increasing their wealth—such as investors in or near retirement. “There’s a massive chunk of wealth transitioning from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase. For them, it’s no longer about, ‘Did I beat the S&P or did I miss it by a couple hundred basis points.’ It’s about, ‘Am I harnessing growth potential,” said Mike Loukas, principal and CEO of TrueMark Investments, which operates a suite of active ETFs, including buffers, under the TrueShares banner. “Investors, to a large degree, are far more comfortable with that tradeoff and the world of hedging than they used to be.” Loukas still sees the benefit of uncapped funds. “There are moments where I’m OK in a normal market, trailing the S&P by a little bit, but in these massive up markets, you can’t afford to trail by 2000 basis points,” Loukas said. “Something that is uncapped has the ability to track the S&P up the ladder without being capped out. It comes down to what individual investors or modelers are looking for, and matching expectations and intents with the right defined outcome for the needs of the portfolio.” While it is always important to see what makes any fund perform the way it does, that’s particularly true with buffers. “The largest education hurdle we’ve had with advisors is that some of these products own underlying large cap stocks. And while those held up awesome at the end of the year, in the recent slide the Mag 7 got hit hard,” said Dynasty’s Nerney. “The index wasn’t down as much as those names, so how were these products lower than the S&P? It was because you’re long large cap tech.” Still, Nerney said the ETFs do have a role to play. “I hope our teams that were using them continue their allocations even though the payoff prolife wasn’t as exciting as it typically is,” Nerney said. “You need to remain systematic in your allocation in any product set you use. [When] portfolios are shedding 5% to 6% a day, there’s nothing like actual protection.” Generally, advisors using buffer ETFs are allocating anywhere from 10% to 25% of a client’s assets to the funds. Buffer ETFs are more common in the RIA space, as broker/dealers more often restrict the investments allowed on the platform, and some have limited the use of buffer ETFs because of the underlying options. “One of the things that still surprises me is that some home offices … say that sounds risky. So, they limit how much an advisor can use them,” Day said. “It’s backwards. If you are an aggressive investor, you can allocate more to these buffers, but if you’re conservative, you can allocate less, which is counterintuitive.” One of the biggest benefits advisors see for the products is mitigating investor behavior, such as panic selling, when markets fall. “Most folks, just by human nature, don’t want to lose money,” Kane said. “So, when you come out and say, ‘We have an option to protect you,’ that’s absolutely great. It’s an easier sell than ‘I would like to put option overlay strategy over your portfolio’, which requires much more nuance to describe. Buffer ETFs are a great way to package it together.” Vest’s Chang also points to behavioral factors as a key selling point. “One of the biggest risks is not volatility. It’s staying invested,” he said. Studies show that investors experience losses 2.5 times more than they experience gains, which often leads them to sell and then miss out when markets turn. “The average equity investor underperforms by 3.5% every year. They would have doubled their returns if they had something that kept them invested.” That makes sense to clients concerned about the heightened volatility roiling markets. “This is when pricing can be extremely attractive,” Chang said. “We are always one tweet away from a 10% move up or down. That’s going to persist for a bit. ... When Henry Ford created the seat belt, less than 10% of consumers paid for that option. But if you’re going to be out there in a Lamborghini, you want to put a seat belt on.” David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. It looks like the Xbox team is facing yet another round of cuts. By Eddie Makuch on June 24, 2025 at 8:14AM PDT Microsoft's Xbox division is facing more layoffs soon. That's according to a report from Bloomberg, which said "major" layoffs at Xbox could be announced next week. This would be just the latest round of cuts at Xbox, following 1,900+ layoffs after the Activision Blizzard deal closed and hundreds more job reductions after that. These cuts, and the ones reportedly planned to be announced next week, are believed to be part of a wider cost-cutting program at Microsoft that has resulted in many thousands of layoffs over the past two years. Tom Warren of The Verge reported earlier this month that Xbox would face more layoffs at the end of June. The timing is seemingly not random, as Microsoft's current fiscal year ends on June 30. Today, The Verge reported, citing a source, that "Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, resulting in some Xbox operations ceasing in some regions." A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment when approach by Bloomberg. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft as well in an attempt to get more details. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously said the company needed to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business. Xbox president Sarah Bond gave an answer many were not pleased with as well regarding the job cuts. Some of Microsoft's new moves in gaming recently have included expanding to branded handheld devices and a new Xbox Meta Quest VR headset. 2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft has big plans. Microsoft's reported latest round of layoffs comes amid profitable times for the company. For Microsoft's latest quarter, the company reported net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division specifically has posted year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft's stock price is up by nearly 150% in the past five years. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Debris flows represent a persistent challenge for disaster prediction in mountainous regions due to their highly nonlinear and multivariate triggering mechanisms. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm-Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-Attention (IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention) model, for precise debris flow hazard prediction in the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin, China. The model is developed and validated using data from 159 debris flow-prone gullies, integrating deep convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures, with hyperparameters autonomously optimized by IKOA. Model explainability is enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which quantify the influence of key factors. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework consistently outperforms 13 benchmark models, achieving a root mean square error of 2.33 × 10−6, mean absolute error of 1.51 × 10−6, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.006%. The model maintains high stability across 50 repeated experiments, strong resilience to 20% input noise, and robust generalizability under five-fold cross-validation. Interpretability analysis identifies potential source energy and maximum 24-hour rainfall as primary determinants and uncovers a dual-threshold physical mechanism underlying debris flow initiation. These findings provide a quantitative basis for adaptive early warning and targeted risk mitigation, and establish a transferable framework for explainable geohazard prediction.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Debris flows constitute a catastrophic geophysical phenomenon that epitomizes the complex interplay between gravitational forces, material rheology, and hydrological dynamics in mountainous environments. These rapid mass movements pose an escalating threat to human settlements, critical infrastructure, and ecological integrity globally, with disproportionate impacts on developing regions with expanding mountain populations [1]. The socioeconomic burden is substantial: between 2000 and 2020, debris flows accounted for approximately 17% of global landslide-related fatalities while generating annual economic losses exceeding 20 billion USD. Unlike other natural hazards with extended warning periods, debris flows manifest with minimal antecedent indicators and propagate at velocities reaching 10 m/s, severely constraining evacuation timeframes and necessitating high-precision predictive frameworks for effective risk reduction [2]. The multifactorial triggering mechanisms underlying these events, characterized by nonlinear threshold responses and complex factor interactions, present formidable challenges for contemporary hazard forecasting. The epistemological evolution of debris flow prediction has traversed distinct methodological paradigms, each characterized by specific conceptual frameworks and analytical limitations. Initial approaches relied on empirical correlations derived from historical event databases, establishing phenomenological relationships for inundation area delineation [3] and precipitation threshold determination [4]. Such frameworks, while operationally accessible, frequently exhibited limited transferability beyond their calibration domains. Subsequent advances introduced physically-based numerical models that simulated the complete process chain from material mobilization through deposition, incorporating rheological principles and granular flow mechanics [5]. These sophisticated simulations demonstrably enhanced impact assessment capabilities [6] and runout predictions in topographically complex terrain. Nevertheless, their widespread implementation remains constrained by intensive parameterization requirements, computational demands, and fundamental uncertainties in constitutive relationships governing material behavior during extreme mobilization events. Intermediate methodological frameworks emerged to address these epistemological limitations through probabilistic formulations and multi-criteria decision architectures. Statistical models employing Bayesian inference frameworks quantified conditional hazard probabilities under varying environmental scenarios, enabling the establishment of robust rainfall thresholds with explicit uncertainty quantification [7]. Concurrently, multi-attribute decision frameworks provided structured methodologies for integrating heterogeneous hazard factors [8], with recent innovations applying Analytic Hierarchy Process techniques to susceptibility mapping across diverse geological contexts [9] and multi-criteria analysis approaches to flood risk assessment in coastal regions [10]. Despite their theoretical elegance, these approaches frequently encounter fundamental constraints in high-dimensional feature space integration and often introduce systematic biases through subjective parameter weighting schemes that compromise prediction reliability. The integration of machine learning (ML) into geohazard assessment represents a paradigmatic transformation in debris flow prediction, facilitating the identification of complex, nonlinear patterns within high-dimensional environmental datasets that remain inaccessible to conventional analytical approaches [11]. Contemporary research has demonstrated the efficacy of artificial neural networks in characterizing rainfall-triggered debris flow probability distributions and advanced information-theoretic coupling methods for susceptibility assessment [12]. These computational frameworks excel in capturing intricate multivariate relationships without requiring explicit physical process formulation [13]. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques enhance predictive stability and generalization capabilities across heterogeneous environmental conditions previously inaccessible to traditional modeling frameworks. Despite their transformative potential, current ML applications to debris flow hazard assessment exhibit critical epistemological and methodological limitations that constrain their scientific impact and operational utility. First, model performance demonstrates an acute sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, with suboptimal parameterization inducing overfitting phenomena that compromise generalization to novel geomorphological contexts [14]. Second, conventional optimization algorithms frequently converge prematurely to local extrema, resulting in suboptimal exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space [15]. Third, and most fundamentally, deep learning architectures manifest intrinsic opacity that creates a profound disconnect between predictive capacity and mechanistic understanding [16]. This explainability deficit, frequently characterized as the “black-box problem,” represents a critical epistemological barrier in hazard forecasting applications. The black-box problem specifically refers to the inherent inability to trace how deep learning models transform input features into output predictions through their complex internal architectures. This opacity manifests through (1) algorithmic complexity, where numerous interconnected neurons and non-linear activation functions obscure input-output relationships; (2) latent feature representation, where models develop abstract internal representations that lack direct physical interpretation; and (3) stochastic learning behavior, where training procedures yield models whose internal configurations cannot be deterministically predicted. Contemporary neural networks, while achieving unprecedented predictive accuracy, typically obscure the contribution of specific variables to prediction outcomes, thereby inhibiting scientific elucidation of causative mechanisms and undermining the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies. Three fundamental research gaps persist in contemporary literature that motivate this study: (1) the predominant prioritization of predictive accuracy over model explainability creates an artificial tension between computational performance and theoretical advancement; (2) current methodological frameworks overwhelmingly employ single-algorithm approaches that inadequately capture the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering conditions; and (3) the systematic integration of advanced optimization techniques with explainable artificial intelligence frameworks remains largely unexplored in geohazard prediction contexts, particularly for multi-parameter debris flow risk assessment. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, particularly the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach, offer promising solutions to these challenges by providing mathematically rigorous attribution mechanisms derived from cooperative game theory principles [17,18]. Despite preliminary applications identifying dominant controlling factors in debris flow research, comprehensive XAI integration within holistic debris flow assessment frameworks remains substantially underdeveloped [19]. Motivated by these research gaps and the potential of XAI approaches, this study aims to develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework that maximizes both predictive accuracy and scientific explainability for debris flow hazard assessment. The specific research objectives include: (1) identifying optimal architectural configurations for capturing complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering factors; (2) quantifying the relative contribution of environmental, geological, and meteorological variables; (3) establishing a theoretical framework connecting physical processes to prediction outcomes through explainable AI; and (4) determining quantitative thresholds governing debris flow risk to support evidence-based intervention strategies. To address these objectives, this study implements an IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework that integrates physics-inspired optimization algorithms with deep learning architectures and explainability mechanisms. This framework combines convolutional networks for spatial feature extraction, bidirectional recurrent units for temporal dynamics modeling, and attention mechanisms for feature importance weighting, specifically designed to capture debris flow triggering mechanisms while providing SHAP-based scientific insights. The framework advances debris flow hazard prediction methodologically, theoretically, analytically, and practically, offering actionable insights for precision disaster risk management. The overall workflow of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g001 Precise determination of influencing factor weights constitutes a fundamental challenge in debris flow hazard assessment. This study proposes a novel game theory-based comprehensive weighting framework that integrates three complementary methodologies: the coefficient of variation method (CVM), entropy weight method (EWM), and CRITIC method [20–22]. Each methodology captures distinct aspects of factor importance: data dispersion, information entropy, and inter-factor correlations, respectively. The proposed framework applies cooperative game theory principles to optimize the collective strengths of these methods, conceptualizing each as a strategic element in a cooperative game to determine optimal weight distribution. The complete framework is illustrated in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g002 The Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA), introduced by Mohamed Abdel-Basset in 2023, serves as the foundation for model optimization in this study. KOA represents a physics-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion [23]. This algorithm conceptualizes the Sun as the optimal solution and planets as candidate solutions, with planetary motion mechanisms driving the evaluation of solution quality. Compared to established optimization algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), KOA exhibits enhanced exploration capabilities within the solution space through innovative search strategies, enabling effective avoidance of local optima entrapment while ensuring stability and robustness in hyperparameter optimization for complex models. From a mathematical perspective, KOA operates through seven sequential steps: Step 1: Initialization process. The algorithm begins with a random generation of candidate solutions representing planets moving within the search space. Each planet possesses a position and velocity representing potential optimization solutions. Each planetary position is formally defined as shown in Equation (1). In Equation (1), Xi represents the ith candidate solution in the model; d represents the number of dimensions; N indicates the number of candidate solutions; Xji,up and Xji,low determine the boundary range of the search space, with rand[0,1] randomly selected values between and . The eccentricity ei and period Ti are initialized according to Equations (2) and (3). In Equations (2) – (3), r is a random number based on a normal distribution. Step 2: Defining the gravitational force (F). Planets experience varying velocities at different orbital positions due to differential gravitational pull from the Sun along elliptical planetary orbits. The gravitational force experienced by a planet is formulated as in Equation (4), while the Euclidean distance is represented in Equation (5). Step 3: Calculating object velocity. Based on gravitational force and Sun-planet distance, the velocity of a planet at any position on its elliptical orbit is expressed as Equation (6). Step 4: Escaping from local optima. The parameter π in the velocity equation modulates search direction, simulating varying orbital directions of planets within the Solar System. This mechanism prevents convergence on local optima, as shown in Equation (7). Step 5: Updating object positions. Planetary motion occurs in two distinct phases: approaching and receding from the Sun. These correspond to the exploitation and exploration phases respectively. During exploration, the algorithm discovers new candidate solutions. During exploitation, solutions near the optimum are refined, as shown in Equation (8). Step 6: Updating Sun-planet distance. Manipulation of parameter h enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, as shown in Equation (9). Step 7: Elitism mechanism. The algorithm evaluates fitness values between current and newly calculated positions, retaining superior solutions while discarding inferior ones, as shown in Equation (10). Despite the promising capabilities of physics-inspired metaheuristics, optimization algorithms frequently encounter fundamental challenges including premature convergence, local optima entrapment, and suboptimal exploration-exploitation balance. To overcome these intrinsic limitations in the standard KOA framework, this study proposes a systematically enhanced variant, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm (IKOA), incorporating three complementary methodological refinements: (1) Chebyshev mapping for ergodic population initialization, (2) golden sine operator for solution space adaptation, and (3) dynamic weight coefficient for balanced search dynamics. This integrative approach ensures exceptional parameter optimization robustness across complex hypersurfaces. The complete algorithmic architecture is illustrated in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g003 Chaos mapping represents an uncertain and random methodology within nonlinear dynamic systems. In the process of initializing position updates, chaotic variables replace the random variables traditionally used in intelligent algorithm processes, thereby offering a broader search range in the solution space compared to probability-based random search strategies. Consequently, employing chaos mapping for population initialization in the KOA enhances the diversity of the population and the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm. This study utilizes the Chebyshev chaos mapping method [24], with its mathematical description presented in Equation (11), where k denotes the order. The Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA), proposed by Tanyildizi et al., is a novel metaheuristic algorithm [25]. Gold-SA differs from swarm intelligence algorithms by focusing on enhancing search efficiency and optimization precision in the later stages through the gradual narrowing of the current solution space. This means that the current search space continuously converges towards the optimal target value. In the traditional KOA algorithm, the efficiency of local and global searches by planetary individuals is relatively low, making the algorithm more susceptible to becoming trapped in local optima as it progresses. By incorporating the golden sine operator into Step 5, and leveraging the properties of the golden ratio coefficient to reduce the solution space, the overall performance of the algorithm is significantly improved. The position update formula with the added golden sine operator is presented in Equation (12). In Equation (15), R1∈[0, 2π]is a random number determining the distance of the individual’s movement in the next iteration, R2∈[0, π] is a random number determining the direction of the next movement, and x1 = -π+(1-π)*2π, x2 = -π + τ*2πare coefficients derived from the golden section ratio τ=(-1)/2, This ratio narrows the algorithm’s search space and guides individuals gradually towards the optimum. To address the issue of insufficient global exploration capability during the position updates for planets close to the Sun in Step 6, a dynamic weight coefficient based on the number of iterations is introduced in Equation (9). This addition provides a balanced capability for global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm, as detailed in the improved formula shown in Equation (13). In Equation (13), k1 = 1-t3/T3, k2 = t3/T3. Within Equation (13), k1 is larger in the early stages of iteration, enhancing the planets’ early exploration ability, while k2 gradually increases in the later stages, ensuring the planets’ local exploitation capability in the latter phase. To evaluate IKOA’s optimization capabilities, this study implemented a benchmark analysis using nine standard test functions from the CEC 2005 benchmark suite [26]. These functions provide standardized performance metrics across multiple dimensions: unimodal functions f1-f5 assess local exploitation efficiency; multimodal functions f6-f7 examine global exploration capabilities; and fixed-dimension multimodal functions f8-f9 evaluate performance in complex search spaces. Table 1 presents the mathematical formulations and characteristics of each function. Experimental dimensionality was set at 30 for functions f1-f7 and 2 for functions f8-f9, following standard protocols. The comparative analysis included IKOA, original KOA, and three contemporary algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) [27–29]. Each function underwent 30 independent optimization trials, with convergence trajectories illustrated in Fig 4. The analysis demonstrates IKOA’s superior performance across optimization metrics. IKOA consistently exhibits accelerated convergence compared to reference algorithms, achieving superior early-stage exploration and late-stage exploitation precision while maintaining an exceptional balance between search diversification and intensification. These qualities establish IKOA’s theoretical foundation for application in debris flow hazard assessment modeling, where its enhanced optimization capabilities directly translate to improved predictive performance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g004 This study presents a novel hierarchical deep learning architecture for debris flow hazard assessment that integrates optimization algorithms with specialized neural network components. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework, illustrated in Fig 5, implements a cascaded processing pipeline for multidimensional geophysical data. The CNN module [30] employs convolutional operations to extract spatially invariant features across multiple abstraction levels, identifying complex topographical signatures that serve as precursors to debris flow events. The BiGRU component [31] extends representation capacity through bidirectional recurrent processing, capturing non-linear dependencies in sequential geophysical processes by propagating information in forward and reverse temporal directions. The Attention mechanism [32] implements adaptive computational focus through learned importance weighting, dynamically modulating feature contributions based on contextual relevance. A distinctive contribution is the meta-optimization approach implemented through IKOA, which systematically refines four foundational hyperparameters: Learning Rate, GRU Units m, CNN Filters n, and Batch Size b. These parameters critically influence model performance, balancing expressiveness, computational efficiency, and generalization capability. The implementation proceeds through four systematic phases: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g005 Step 1: Data Preprocessing. Statistical standardization establishes numerical stability while K-Nearest Neighbors imputation preserves data integrity through the reconstruction of missing values. Step 2: Model Initialization. The preprocessed dataset undergoes chronological partitioning with 70% allocated for parameter estimation and feature learning. Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization. IKOA explores the hyperparameter space to identify optimal architectural configurations through iterative performance evaluation. Step 4: Model Deployment. The optimized architecture is applied to the remaining 30% for validation and hazard prediction generation. The study area encompasses the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin in China (Fig 6), spanning approximately 33,500 km2 and constituting 8.7% of Yunnan Province’s total area. This geographically significant region extends 650 km along the Nujiang (Salween) River, bordered by the Lancang River Basin to the east and Myanmar to the west, spanning from the southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau to the northern extent of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The study area is situated between 24°07’ to 28°23’ N latitude and 98°07’ to 100°00’ E longitude. The geomorphology exhibits extreme topographic heterogeneity characterized by dramatic alpine gorges and precipitous mountainous terrain. The landscape features a pronounced north-south elevation gradient, intersected by the Hengduan Mountain Range. The area contains one of the most significant geomorphological features in the region, the Nujiang Grand Canyon, which ranks among the world’s deepest canyon systems. This exceptional topographic amplitude creates optimal conditions for gravitational mass movements, particularly debris flows with substantial kinetic energy and destructive potential. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g006 The region’s climate is classified as humid subtropical monsoon, characterized by abundant yet spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Annual rainfall demonstrates significant variability, with maximum precipitation reaching approximately 1500 mm in higher elevation zones and diminishing to below 1000 mm in lower elevation areas. Temporal distribution exhibits marked seasonality, with over 51% of annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoon period [27]. This concentrated rainfall pattern constitutes the primary triggering mechanism for debris flow mobilization. The geological framework displays exceptional complexity, dominated by metamorphic complexes and sedimentary formations intersected by numerous fault systems. This intricate structural geology, combined with intense neotectonic activity, has produced extensive zones of fractured and weathered lithological material that serves as source material for debris flows. The synergistic interaction between fractured bedrock, steep topographic gradients, and concentrated seasonal precipitation creates ideal conditions for debris flow initiation and propagation. These distinctive geoenvironmental characteristics contribute to the elevated frequency and magnitude of geohazard events throughout the region. The prevalence of these hazards necessitates systematic investigation for effective disaster risk reduction strategies and sustainable regional development initiatives. This research utilizes comprehensive data from 159 debris flow prone gullies distributed throughout the Nujiang River Basin, applying advanced deep learning methodologies to analyze and predict debris flow hazard intensities across diverse geomorphological contexts. Elevation data are based on SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, NASA/USGS). Administrative boundaries and rivers are from Natural Earth (public domain). Map generated by the authors. This investigation established a comprehensive parametric foundation for debris flow susceptibility analysis through systematic integration of multidisciplinary data sources, including extensive literature synthesis [28], satellite remote sensing explanation, field-based geomorphological investigations, and archival geological and hydrological documentation. Advanced geospatial technologies facilitated rigorous extraction of topographical variables from 30m-resolution SRTM DEM data, while meteorological parameters underwent spatial interpolation through geostatistical inverse distance weighting algorithms calibrated with observational data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the study domain. The extracted factors for the study area include: maximum 24-hour rainfall (X1), annual average rainfall (X2), annual average temperature (X3), annual average wind speed (X4), annual average vapor pressure (X5), annual average relative humidity (X6), potential source energy (X7), catchment area (X8), average gradient of the main channel (X9), length ratio of the sediment supply section (X10), length of the main channel (X11), sinuosity of the main channel (X12), drainage density of the catchment (X13), valley profile roundness (X14), vegetation cover rate (X15), average slope (X16), maximum relative elevation difference within the catchment (X17), lithological impact (X18), and dynamic storage capacity (X19). A total of 19 factors were selected, sequentially numbered as X1 to X19. In line with the principles of systematicity, completeness, effectiveness, and comparability in the selection of evaluation indicators, and considering the accessibility and operability of the data, the debris flow outbreak system in the study area was divided into three subsystems: the hydrometeorological subsystem, material source subsystem, and geographic subsystem, encompassing the aforementioned 19 factors (X1-X19). The rationale for selecting each factor is detailed in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t002 Statistical independence among predictor variables constitutes a critical prerequisite for robust hazard modeling. The research implemented Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to systematically diagnose multicollinearity and optimize variable selection. VIF quantifies variance inflation of regression coefficients due to linear dependencies, calculated as 1/(1-R2), where R2 represents the coefficient when regressing a variable against all other predictors. While conventional guidelines suggest a VIF threshold of 10, the current investigation adopted a more conservative threshold of 5 to ensure model stability and parameter precision for complex environmental systems [51]. Multicollinearity diagnosis identified four factors exceeding this threshold: X10 (length ratio of the sediment supply section: 7.83), X14 (valley profile roundness: 5.62), X17 (maximum relative elevation difference: 8.14), and X19 (dynamic storage capacity: 6.95). These variables were systematically excluded to maximize model precision. Fig 7 presents the VIF analysis results for all hazard-causing factors, illustrating that the final variable selection optimizes unique information content while minimizing statistical redundancy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g007 The inherent complexity of debris flow systems necessitates sophisticated factor weighting approaches that accommodate the multidimensional interactions among diverse variables. This study implements the game theory-based comprehensive weighting methodology detailed in section 2.1, achieving optimal integration of complementary weighting perspectives. The resulting factor weights derived from this approach are presented in Fig 8. The hazard level assessment procedure follows a systematic framework: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g008 Step 1: Normalize the original dataset to eliminate the dimensional impact of different factors. The normalization formulas for maximum-type indicators and minimum-type indicators are shown in Equations (14) and (15), respectively. In Equations (14) – (15), xij represents the jth influencing factor of the ith gully, i = 1,2,…,n and j = 1,2,…,m, n denotes the number of data groups, and m denotes the number of factors. Step 2: For each debris flow gully, sum the weighted data of influencing factors to obtain its hazard assessment value. The calculation formula is shown in Equation (16). In Equation (16), wj represents the weight of each factor through Fig 8, and rij denotes the normalized value of the jth influencing factor for the ith gully. To ensure statistical robustness, experimental parameters were standardized with population size fixed at 30 and iteration count at 100 across all optimization algorithms. The dataset underwent a 70%/30% training-testing partition, with results averaged across 50 independent runs. Notably, 12 test samples with distinctive geomorphological characteristics were deliberately included to evaluate model generalization capabilities across diverse debris flow conditions. Performance evaluation employed three complementary metrics: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The proposed IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy when benchmarked against 13 established machine learning regression models [52–55], as quantified in Table 3. Performance comparisons among the top five models are visualized in Fig 9. The hybrid model achieved unprecedented prediction precision with RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6, MAE of 1.51 × 10−6, and MAPE of 0.006%, representing multiple orders of magnitude improvement over conventional approaches. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g009 This superior performance reflects systematic hyperparameter optimization through the improved Krill Herd algorithm. The learning rate underwent progressive refinement from 0.0061 to 0.0014, while GRU units converged to 116, CNN filters stabilized at 54, and batch size optimized at 31. The hyperparameter evolution across iterations, detailed in Table 4, demonstrates the algorithm’s capacity to navigate complex parameter spaces while avoiding local optima. Architecturally, the bidirectional GRU component captures temporal dependencies in multidimensional feature sequences, while the attention mechanism adaptively prioritizes critical factors including slope characteristics, precipitation parameters, and drainage properties. Unlike models such as GWO-ELM and PSO-SVM, which exhibit performance degradation with geomorphologically distinct test cases, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model maintains exceptional prediction stability across diverse geological contexts, validating its effectiveness in modeling the inherently nonlinear and multidimensional nature of debris flow hazard systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t004 Through systematic application of SHAP methodology, this study deconstructs the internal decision processes of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, revealing that the architecture captures both physical threshold effects and multifactorial regulatory relationships governing debris flow initiation. Fig 10(a) presents a quantitative hierarchical ranking of feature importance wherein potential source energy X7 emerges as the predominant factor with a mean absolute SHAP value of 1.07 × 10−2, approximately 4.6-fold greater than the second-ranked parameter. Annual mean temperature X3, annual mean vapor pressure X5, and average slope X16 constitute the second tier of importance, while annual mean rainfall X2, vegetation coverage X15, and main channel length X11 form a distinct third tier. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g010 Fig 10(b) elucidates the dependency relationship between potential source energy X7 and its corresponding SHAP values, demonstrating a threshold effect in debris flow triggering mechanisms. The relationship manifests as a sigmoidal nonlinear curve, optimally fitted by the cubic function y = 1.25 × 10-4x3 - 9.37 × 10-4x2 + 1.83 × 10-2x − 2.21 × 10−2 with an R2 value of 0.98. A critical inflection point is identified at X7 ≈ 3.12 × 109 J/m2, effectively partitioning the risk domain into two distinct regions: a low-risk zone where X7 < 3.12 × 109 J/m2 and a high-risk zone where X7 > 3.12 × 109 J/m2. Within the low-risk zone, SHAP values consistently approximate zero or exhibit slightly negative values, indicating insufficient energy accumulation for debris flow mobilization; within the high-risk zone, SHAP values demonstrate an accelerating positive trend as X7 increases, reflecting the nonlinear amplification characteristic of debris flow initiation. The SHAP value distribution in Fig 10(c) further illuminates the distinct influence patterns of various factors on model predictions. The distribution for X7 exhibits pronounced bimodal segregation: low-value samples cluster tightly around the zero SHAP value region, while high-value samples display substantial positive shifts, reaching SHAP values exceeding 0.2, surpassing the influence range of all other features. This polarized distribution provides statistical confirmation of the threshold phenomenon. High values of maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and annual mean relative humidity X6 similarly exhibit positive SHAP value tendencies, albeit with considerably greater dispersion, indicating that these parameters function as conditional triggers whose efficacy is contingent upon the antecedent state of source energy accumulation. Based on the comprehensive SHAP analysis, a physically explainable mechanistic framework for debris flow formation emerges: potential source energy X7 constitutes the fundamental prerequisite condition with a quantified threshold of 3.12 × 109 J/m2; environmental parameters such as annual mean temperature X3 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 function as regulatory modulators, exerting indirect effects by altering source material stability; hydrological factors, primarily maximum 24-hour rainfall X1, operate as activation triggers that initiate debris flow mobilization only when the prerequisite energy threshold condition has been satisfied. Building upon the identification of potential source energy X7 as the dominant factor, this section systematically explores factor interactions and their impact on debris flow risk prediction, revealing complex relationships with implications for monitoring and early warning systems optimization. Fig 11 illustrates the interaction effects between source energy and key environmental variables. The interaction between X7 and annual mean temperature X3 reveals a significant correlation r = 0.06, p < 0.05, with risk contribution substantially increasing when the temperature exceeds 16°C in high source energy areas. This temperature-energy interaction suggests that thermal conditions may accelerate material destabilization processes in areas with significant loose material accumulation. The practical implication for disaster prevention is that temperature monitoring should be integrated into early warning systems, particularly for regions with high material accumulation. Warning thresholds may require seasonal adjustments with heightened vigilance during warmer periods when temperatures exceed 16°C. Similarly, the interaction between X7 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 demonstrates a stronger correlation r = 0.19, p < 0.01, with high X7 samples manifesting significantly elevated SHAP values when X5 exceeds 15 hPa. This finding indicates that humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks alongside traditional rainfall gauges, particularly in areas with substantial loose material accumulation, as atmospheric moisture conditions appear to play an important role in destabilizing source materials. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g011 The interaction between maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and X7 provides particularly valuable insights for risk management. Despite statistical non-significance in overall correlation r = 0.02, p > 0.05, clear nonlinear patterns emerge: rainfall intensity substantially impacts risk only when source energy exceeds approximately 5 × 109 J/m2, while having minimal effect below this threshold. This conditional relationship fundamentally challenges the conventional rainfall-threshold approach to debris flow warning. For early warning system design, this finding suggests implementing a hierarchical approach where areas are first classified by source energy potential, with advanced rainfall monitoring prioritized specifically in high-energy zones. For low-energy zones, basic rainfall monitoring may be sufficient regardless of precipitation intensity. Rainfall thresholds should be dynamic rather than fixed, adjusting based on source material conditions. Fig 12 refines the threshold identification through a detailed SHAP response analysis. The upper panel presents a higher-order polynomial analysis of the X7 SHAP response curve with R2 = 0.99, identifying a critical inflection point at X7 = 3.00 × 109 J/m2. This value provides a quantitative criterion for classifying terrain vulnerability in hazard mapping exercises and prioritizing areas for source material control measures such as check dams, retaining walls, and slope stabilization projects. The upper right panel identifies a distinct inflection point in the X1 SHAP dependency curve at X1 = 27.01 mm, providing a data-driven basis for rainfall warning standards. This specific threshold offers a quantitative reference for evaluating and potentially adjusting current warning thresholds in operational early warning systems. The lower panel integrates these insights into a comprehensive two-dimensional risk contour map with three distinct risk domains that translate directly to operational warning levels. The blue region represents normal conditions where predicted risk values fall below 0.03, warranting routine monitoring procedures. The yellow zone indicates heightened alert conditions with predicted risk values between 0.03 and 0.20, necessitating increased monitoring frequency and preliminary emergency preparations. The red domain signifies emergency response conditions where the predicted risk exceeds 0.20, requiring immediate protective actions including potential evacuations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g012 Fig 13 extends this analysis into three dimensions, revealing a comprehensive risk response surface that captures the compound effects of X7 and X1. The visualization of threshold planes creates four distinct quadrants that translate to operational intervention priority zones. The first quadrant, characterized by values below both X7 and X1 thresholds, indicates low-priority zones warranting only basic monitoring. The second quadrant, where X7 exceeds its threshold while X1 remains below its critical value, demarcates source-control priority zones where engineering measures to reduce material accumulation should be emphasized. The third quadrant, characterized by X1 values above the threshold while X7 remains below its critical level, identifies hydrological management priority zones where drainage improvements and runoff control should be prioritized. The fourth quadrant, where both X7 and X1 exceed their respective thresholds, delineates comprehensive intervention zones requiring integrated approaches combining multiple strategies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g013 Building on identified risk factors and thresholds, this section evaluates the comparative efficacy of different risk reduction approaches, providing quantitative insights for evidence-based disaster management decision-making. Figs 14(a) and 14(b) present comparative risk response curves for interventions targeting X7 and X1, respectively. The analysis reveals that reducing maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 from 29.5 mm to 27.0 mm yields a 58.8% risk reduction, while reducing potential source energy X7 from 8.0 × 109 J/m2 to 3.0 × 109 J/m2 achieves a 25.0% risk diminution. This substantial difference in intervention efficacy provides clear guidance for resource allocation: rainfall control measures may yield faster risk reduction returns compared to source control measures. Figs 14(c) and 14(d) further refine this analysis through spatially-resolved risk reduction percentage contour maps, revealing that vulnerability mapping should identify transition zones where risk factors are marginally above threshold values, as modest interventions in these areas may yield substantial risk reduction. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g014 Fig 15 presents SHAP force plots from representative data points selected through stratified random sampling, revealing substantial heterogeneity in localized risk factor compositions. This heterogeneity indicates that effective risk management requires location-specific approaches tailored to the dominant local risk factors. For implementation, this suggests customizing monitoring systems based on local risk factor compositions. Locations dominated by meteorological factors would benefit from enhanced weather-based warning systems with meteorological monitoring, while areas where topographical factors predominate would likely respond better to physical infrastructure interventions rather than precipitation-based warning systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g015 Synthesizing these analytical results, a practical framework for precision debris flow risk management emerges with several actionable components. Early warning systems should implement rainfall thresholds that adjust based on source energy conditions rather than universal rainfall values, with lower rainfall thresholds applied in high source energy areas and higher thresholds in low energy areas. Beyond traditional rainfall monitoring, temperature and humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks, especially in areas where source energy exceeds the identified threshold. In resource-constrained environments, interventions should be sequenced according to threshold proximity, prioritizing areas just above threshold values where modest investments yield substantial risk reduction. Different zones require specific approaches: high-source energy zones warrant engineering interventions to reduce source material accumulation; critical rainfall zones require drainage improvements and runoff control; dual-threshold exceedance zones necessitate comprehensive management strategies incorporating both engineering measures and enhanced monitoring systems. Warning thresholds and monitoring intensity should be adjusted seasonally where temperature appears as a significant risk modifier, with heightened vigilance during periods exceeding 16°C. While the specific threshold values identified in this study are calibrated to the study area’s geological and climatological context, the methodological framework for threshold identification and factor interaction analysis remains transferable across diverse geographical settings, allowing regional calibration of specific thresholds while maintaining the structural integrity of the factor interaction paradigm. The stability of a model is crucial for reliable debris flow hazard prediction, as it ensures consistent results across multiple independent runs. To evaluate the stability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, 50 independent experiments were conducted, recording the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their standard deviations (SD). Lower SD values indicate higher stability and consistency in predictions. As shown in Table 5 the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated minimal performance fluctuations, with an RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6 ± 1.51 × 10−7 and an MAE of 1.51 × 10−6 ± 1.10 × 10−7, outperforming all comparative models. These results highlight the model’s reliability and reproducibility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in debris flow hazard prediction. Its stable performance improves the credibility of risk assessments and provides robust technical support for disaster prevention and mitigation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t005 Robustness is essential for ensuring a model’s reliability when handling data disturbances such as noise or outliers, which are common in real-world geological and meteorological datasets. To evaluate the robustness of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, random noise levels of 5%, 10%, and 20% were added to the test dataset to simulate possible data disturbances. The changes in performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were observed to determine the model’s ability to handle noisy data. As shown in Table 6, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model showed minimal performance degradation. When the noise level increased from 0% to 20%, the RMSE rose by only 7.9 × 10−7, and the MAE increased by approximately 4.9 × 10−7. Compared to other models, these slight increases demonstrate the strong robustness of the proposed model, which ensures high predictive accuracy even under noisy data conditions. This robustness confirms the model’s reliability in complex environments and enhances its applicability to practical disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t006 The applicability of a model is crucial for assessing its practical value, particularly its suitability across different regions and datasets. To evaluate the applicability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, a 5-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were recorded for each fold to assess performance consistency. As shown in the results in Table 7, the RMSE ranged from 2.35 × 10−6 to 2.50 × 10−6, and the MAE ranged from 1.55 × 10−6 to 1.65 × 10−6, with minimal fluctuations across the folds. This consistent performance demonstrates the model’s strong applicability and stability, making it suitable for predicting debris flow hazards not only in the specific study area but also in other geographical regions. Its generalizability provides robust technical support for global disaster risk assessment and early warning efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t007 This study proposes an integrated IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework with SHAP explainability for high-precision debris flow hazard prediction that combines advanced optimization techniques, multidimensional deep learning architectures, and explainable AI mechanisms. Through systematic implementation and validation in the Nujiang River Basin, China, the study yields five principal contributions: The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Information Technology Center, Zhejiang University.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) has experienced a remarkable surge in its stock price, climbing approximately 600% over the past twelve months. This impressive growth is largely due to the success of its recent rocket launches and the securing of new contracts, including those for its new Neutron rocket. While the existing Electron rocket is designed to deploy small payloads, with a capacity of up to 300 kilograms, into space, Rocket Lab's second and more powerful vehicle, the Neutron, will significantly increase this capacity, capable of carrying up to 13,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit. While these advancements are promising, Rocket Lab's stock appears expensive and unattractive at its current valuation, especially given its recent significant rally. We’ve reached this conclusion by analyzing RKLB stock's current valuation against its recent operating performance and its historical and present financial health. Our comprehensive analysis of Rocket Lab USA, assessing Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates that the company has only a moderate operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, RKLB stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Rocket Lab USA's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Rocket Lab USA’s profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Rocket Lab USA's balance sheet looks very strong. RKLB stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Rocket Lab USA's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Rocket Lab shows impressive sales growth and a strong financial position. It's understandable for a company at this early stage to have negative margins and a high cash burn rate. Despite these positives, the stock appears to have priced in all the good news, currently trading at 35 times its trailing revenues. While the upcoming Neutron rocket launch and potential new orders could certainly drive the stock higher, the current valuation presents a high risk. Additionally, there’s the broader concern of a market downturn given the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical climate. We’ve seen how sensitive the stock can be to such conditions, as evidenced by its over 80% drop during the 2022 inflation shock market correction. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Meta’s Quest 3S Xbox Edition Is a Great Value, but There’s Just One Big Tradeoff

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoftâs wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S’ displays don’t offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience. Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesnât let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft’s streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain. Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming. Pros Cons Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it’s less effective for game streaming. I’ve become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it’s what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on whatâs normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, thereâs a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best. The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the QuestÂ 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you’re directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It’s not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying. While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920×1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you’ll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I’m already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing. If you donât own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strapâwhich offers better comfort than the default headbandânormally retails for $70. The controllerâs suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you’ll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streamingâwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titlesâyou wonât have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store donât take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option. Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a âgamer device,” enough that it shouldnât stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt. Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole âfamilyâ of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That canât be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the companyâs own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, weâll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

Title: A cease-fire between Israel and Iran hangs in the balance. The markets are holding their nerve.

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London. A former animation president at Warner Bros. and Comcast's DreamWorks is betting he can create the next Hollywood franchises with the help of AI — and just raised $11.6 million to do it. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump announced a cease-fire between Iran and Israel. Israel says Iran has violated it. We're looking at how the markets are reacting — and what they're expecting next. What's on deck Markets: Real-estate investors are no longer counting out San Francisco. Tech: Leaked files and the startup's own contractors are calling Scale AI's security into question. Business: Why we should all know less about each other at work. But first, the markets are hopeful. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "Please do not violate it!" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post earlier this morning. He was referring to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, which Trump said was "now in effect." It was the news the markets had been waiting for. European and US stock-index futures both jumped, while the dollar fell against all its major peers and gold, a safe haven asset, dropped 1.3%. Oil prices, meanwhile, continued their plunge. Hours later, Israel's defense minister said Iran had violated the cease-fire — and vowed to respond with "powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran." Iran has denied the accusation. BI is covering this developing story. Follow our coverage. In many cases, the traditional risk-off response would've hampered the early-morning market rally, yet US stock futures are still firmly up. While the latest developments appear to signal a renewed escalation, markets are reacting as if this is a temporary disruption in an otherwise steady move toward de-escalation. We saw a similar thing yesterday, when Iran said it fired missiles at a US military base in Qatar. Fears of supply disruption would normally send oil prices up, but the attack was largely believed to be symbolic — Trump thanked Iran for giving the US "early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost." Oil prices continued to fall. Investors had also been pricing in geopolitical risks for months. "There wasn't much in the way of escalation so markets breathed a sigh of relief," Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI. We might be witnessing a similar scenario play out. A cease-fire hangs in the balance, but amid a cloud of uncertainty, it seems the markets are holding their nerve. 1. Don't get too excited about Tesla's stock jump, UBS says. The EV-maker's stock leapt 11% Monday morning after its robotaxi launch, but UBS said the opportunity is "already priced into the stock" in a note. Tesla's stock has been on a wild ride this year and is still down 13.6% YTD. 2. San Francisco could be in for a real estate rebound. The city is buzzing again thanks to RTO mandates. While the average rent price is still below pre-pandemic levels, they're predicted to tick up. Large investors are aiming to capitalize on a rebound by buying up multi-family homes. 3. The housing market is slowly turning in favor of buyers. A Redfin report showed US home prices rose 0.7% in May, the smallest increase since 2023. They expect this trend to continue and potentially start showing year-on-year declines by the end of 2025. 1. Scale AI's data security problem. The startup, which uses public Google Docs to track internal work for its high-profile clients, has left multiple AI training docs labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with a link, BI has found. While there's no indication that Scale AI's practices have caused a breach, one expert called it "dangerous." 2. Leave a tip? JK! Tesla's robotaxi service trolls users who try to tip their non-human drivers, some commuters discovered shortly after the robotaxi launch in Austin. See what happens when you try. 3. Chatbots are competing for users on WhatsApp. The messaging app, owned by Meta, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," according to Mark Zuckerberg. It's also becoming an AI free-for-all as rival chatbots compete for audiences, which could hurt Meta's quest to become the default AI provider, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Make coworkers mysterious again. It's good that workplaces have become more inviting, but there's a cost to sharing too much. Besides annoying coworkers and managers, oversharing can hurt an employee's reputation and their organization's, writes BI's Emily Stewart. 2. Compass is lawyering up to fight Zillow. The real estate brokerage accused Zillow of violating antitrust laws by forcing listings onto its platform in a lawsuit filed Monday. Zillow has been beefing with big brokerages since they started gatekeeping certain listings, arguing that they're creating an uneven playing field for homebuyers. 3. DTC bedding brand Parachute folds 19 stores. Parachute shrank its retail footprint from 26 to seven storefronts over the past year, becoming the latest direct-to-consumer brand that's struggled to scale or turn a profit. It said it plans to focus on e-commerce and partnerships with retailers like Target instead. New York City primary mayoral election.

Title: Google Has Reportedly Cut its Smart TV Budget by 10%

Google has reportedly cut the budget of its smart TV team by 10%, according to a report from The Information, citing people familiar with the situation (via Android Police). The budget cuts are said to be linked with recent layoffs at the Google TV division, despite Google planning to revamp the smart TV platform with its Gemini AI later this year. Google TV is what powers the Google Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV streamer, and various smart TVs and media players made by third-party manufacturers. Back in September, Google announced that there are now over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices on the market. However, it’s hard to see Google taking its smart TV platform as a priority despite aggressive competition from Amazon, Roku, and built-in software experiences from Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS).

"*" indicates required fields Δ Still, a Google representative shared the following statement with The Information. “We continue to invest in Google TV with new user experiences including the upcoming integration of Gemini. There are more than 270 million Android TV devices, and we remain committed to growing this ecosystem with an exciting road map ahead.” According to the report, the budget cuts affecting Google’s smart TV team come at a time when the company is focusing more on YouTube as its main entertainment platform. Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan boldly claimed that “YouTube is the new television,” with TV now being the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. YouTube also brings Google a lot of revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers in the US. The Information reports that Google would like to take the platform into new directions to better compete with streaming platforms like Netflix. YouTube recently hired long-time Disney executive Justin Connolly as its global head of sports and media. The move quickly led Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against YouTube and Connolly. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

June 24, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) shares have experienced significant growth, increasing by 40% in 2024 (calendar year) and tacking on another 7% so far in 2025, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s 2% increase. What’s fueling this momentum? Robust performance supported by its membership model. In fiscal Q3 2025 (which ended on May 11), Costco generated $63.2 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in operating profit. Of that amount, $1.2 billion was derived from membership fees alone—accounting for nearly half of the operating profit, and primarily recurring. With inflation putting pressure on household budgets, Costco’s value-oriented model is resonating well with consumers. In May 2025, sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 7%—more than twice the 3% growth across the broader U.S. retail industry. At first glance, it seems like a retail paradise. However, here’s the drawback: Costco is trading at 55 times earnings and 59 times free cash flow, resulting in a meager 1.7% cash flow yield. For perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which enjoys faster top-line growth and exposure to high-margin sectors like cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. While Costco may claim scale, strategic position, and market affection, it comes at a hefty cost. Refer to Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Costco’s valuation assumes perfection, and even a minor deceleration could lead to turbulence. To put it in perspective, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares plummeted nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, and 32% during the inflation-driven pullback of 2022. Investors should remain aware of that history, even as the current fundamentals appear strong. Costco’s high valuation is based on its consistently strong performance. In fiscal Q3 2025, the company achieved earnings per share of $4.28, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase, on $63.21 billion in revenue, an 8% rise. Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%. In the latest quarter, Costco’s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model’s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company’s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock’s recent surge. Operating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic—not price inflation—is driving the growth. Costco’s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: HIMS Stock To $25?

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NASDAQ: HIMS) experienced a devastating 35% stock crash on June 23, 2025, after Novo Nordisk abruptly terminated their brief partnership. The dramatic sell-off reflects not just the immediate loss of a key business relationship, but fundamental questions about the company’s long-term viability in the weight-loss drug market. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. On a separate note, see – Is Iran Bluffing While Readying An Attack? The collaboration between HIMS and Novo Nordisk, which began in April 2025, was supposed to be a game-changer for the telehealth company. The partnership promised direct access to Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug, through HIMS's platform. This arrangement had fueled much of HIMS's remarkable 150% stock surge earlier this year, as investors bet on a clear pathway to sustained revenue growth. However, the partnership lasted barely two months. Novo Nordisk cited concerns over what it called "illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing" by HIMS, specifically pointing to the company’s continued sales of personalized, compounded versions of semaglutide (Wegovy’s active ingredient) rather than focusing solely on the branded medication. The dispute highlights a fundamental tension in the weight-loss drug market. Following the FDA’s declaration that the semaglutide shortage had ended, compounding pharmacies technically lost their legal justification to produce copycat versions of the drug. Yet HIMS continued marketing personalized versions of the treatment, which Novo Nordisk viewed as undermining their branded product and potentially violating regulatory requirements. This strategic misstep by HIMS reveals a deeper problem: the company appeared to prioritize its existing compounded drug business over nurturing the partnership that investors had priced as its future growth engine. The decision to continue selling personalized versions while simultaneously partnering with Novo Nordisk created an untenable conflict of interest. The stock crash, while severe, may still not fully reflect HIMS’s diminished prospects. Even after the 35% decline, HIMS trades at approximately seven times trailing revenues— more than double its five-year historical average of three times revenues. This elevated multiple made sense when investors expected the Novo Nordisk partnership to drive explosive growth, but that rationale has now evaporated. If HIMS were to revert to its historical valuation multiple of three times revenues, the stock would fall to around $25 — representing another 40% decline from current levels. This suggests the selling may not be finished, particularly as investors reassess the company’s growth trajectory without its key partnership. HIMS can theoretically continue selling personalized obesity treatments, but this approach faces multiple headwinds. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the FDA potentially intervening if it determines that companies are abusing compounding loopholes rather than providing genuinely personalized medicine. The loss of Wegovy’s direct sales potential also eliminates what could have been a massive revenue stream from the company's existing member base. The question now becomes whether HIMS’s remaining business model can generate sufficient growth to justify any premium valuation. The company's personalized approach may serve a niche market, but it's unlikely to match the scale that direct Wegovy sales could have provided. The HIMS situation represents a classic case where investors should resist the urge to "buy the dip." While the stock’s 35% decline appears dramatic, the fundamental investment thesis has now been altered. The company has lost its clearest path to significant revenue growth and faces an elevated risk profile regarding regulatory compliance. For now, the prudent approach is to wait and observe how the situation develops. HIMS may find alternative pathways to growth, but without the Novo Nordisk partnership, those routes are far less certain and likely less lucrative. The market's brutal reaction to the partnership termination sends a clear message: when a company's primary growth catalyst disappears overnight, even a 35% decline may not be enough to restore attractive risk-adjusted returns. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. 1.

Title: If you think your job is hard right now, try working in HR
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hr-workers-miserable-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-24T08:35:03Z

Over the past 18 months, Evan Loveless has led seven rounds of layoffs, personally informing hundreds of his ad-agency colleagues that they were being let go. "It's a chronic feeling of sadness because it's so frequent for me," said Loveless, a senior human-resources partner in St. Louis. "It's like being stuck under a raincloud." Loveless recalled a particularly soul-crushing layoff conversation with a worker who thought he was reaching out with news about a promotion. "Sometimes the person's husband or wife also just lost their job," he said. "You see their faces and then their faces haunt you a little bit." Working in HR has never been glamorous, as the occupation often requires enforcing unpopular company rules and decisions. Now, HR professionals say the job is getting downright ugly. Unceasing layoffs, stricter return-to-office mandates, immigration raids in the workplace, and a sudden need to help everyone master AI are among the latest challenges upending their workloads. "It's a confluence of events that are occurring simultaneously, the likes of which and magnitude of which I never have observed in my more than 30 years of being a human-capital leader," Jim Link, chief human resources officer for the Society of Human Resource Management, told Business Insider. The new rigors come after another tumultuous period for HR workers. During the pandemic years, they suddenly had to develop and manage remote-work set-ups, grapple with anti-vaccine pushback, and deal with employee tensions and calls to action following the murder of George Floyd. Today, HR teams are juggling even more, said Tracy Brower, a Ph.d sociologist in Michigan who researches organizational behavior. "The demands on HR today are significant, increasing, and intense," said Brower. One of the new tasks HR is having to deal with is the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the workplace. Several times a week foreign workers now come to Alexandra Valverde, an HR director for a midsize food manufacturer in the Southeast, with concerns about getting swept up in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Some have tears in their eyes. "This is the hardest year I've had in HR," said Valverde, who's been working in the industry since 2019. "The fear I'm seeing from employees, even if their status is completely fine — that is something I hadn't experienced before." The steady drumbeat of layoffs is also particularly unsettling for HR workers at companies with staffers on H1-B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily live and work in the U.S. if they meet certain criteria. "It's never easy to lay anybody off, but it's even harder when you're telling someone they're probably going to leave the country," said Mike Smart, an HR executive at a California tech company. Upon losing a job, H1-B workers typically have just 60 days to find another employer or face deportation. "Even in the best of job markets, 60 days isn't ample by any stretch," said Smart. As of May, employers have announced 696,309 job cuts this year, an 80% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Making matters worse, the cuts are coming at a time when company chiefs are warning of even more layoffs coming down the line due to the rise of generative AI and AI agents. Last week Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company's extensive use of the technology is expected to reduce its total corporate workforce, which totaled approximately 1.5 million last year. CEOs of other companies, including chatbot maker Anthropic, freelance-job site Fiverr, and payments provider Klarna, have recently issued similar declarations. HR workers are used to taking heat for implementing policies that don't sit well with workers. But lately they say it's gotten a lot harder to keep their cool. In the second quarter, employees at organizations that experienced layoffs in the past year committed 67% more acts of so-called workplace incivility on average than those at firms without such cuts, according to new SHRM data. Those acts, which the trade group says includes silencing and excessively monitoring colleagues, were also 63% higher among workers at organizations with return-to-office mandates than at those without. David Gaspin, the head of HR for a commercial real-estate company in New York, said that at his previous employer he was hit with "some serious vitriol" from a colleague he thought he had a good relationship with after having to lay this person off last year. The tongue-lashing included comments such as "you're just a corporate tool" and "you're a horrible human being." "That's never easy to hear," said Gaspin. Given the more taxing landscape, it's perhaps no wonder that fewer people are looking for work in HR. Searches for HR jobs on Indeed.com in the first half of this year were down nearly 5% from the first half of 2024, and they've been declining annually since 2021, Indeed data show. Separately, a 2022 study from LinkedIn found HR had the highest turnover rate of any job function. (The job site hasn't updated the report since then.) Rebecca Taylor, a former HR professional in New Jersey who co-hosts a podcast called HR Confessions, said one reason she left the field is that she was tired of always being the office grinch. The final straw came after a worker she was tasked with laying off looked up her parents' landline and called them repeatedly to chastise her. "It was scary," said Taylor, who uses a pseudonym partly because of that incident. If a disgruntled employee is angry enough, she added, what else will they try to find? Jump to

Title: Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing with Axon Framework in Spring

Modern enterprise applications often require complex consistency, scalability, and traceability features. This is where CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing shine. Together, they allow systems to scale efficiently while preserving a full audit trail of all state changes. In this article, you’ll learn how to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing using the Axon Framework in Spring Boot. We’ll cover: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the write model (commands) from the read model (queries). This decoupling allows each side to scale and evolve independently. Instead of storing the current state in a database, Event Sourcing stores all changes to the state as a sequence of events. For example, instead of storing: You would store: The current state is rebuilt by replaying these events. The Axon Framework simplifies the implementation of CQRS and Event Sourcing in Java. It provides: Let’s walk through a sample implementation of an Order Management System using Axon. Replaying hundreds or thousands of events to restore state can slow down system performance. Snapshotting solves this by saving the state of an aggregate after a certain number of events, so only a few need to be replayed. Axon Framework makes it surprisingly manageable to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing in Spring Boot. With proper use of aggregates, projections, and snapshotting, you get a scalable, event-driven architecture that’s built for the long haul. Whether you’re building systems that need audit logs, complex workflows, or massive scalability, Axon gives you the building blocks to make it happen cleanly and reliably. We will contact you soon.

Title: A Postcard from Cannes Lions: Power Struggles, Winners, and AI

This year’s Cannes Lions, the ad industry’s biggest festival, unfolded against a backdrop of upheaval and anxiety. The industry is at a critical moment—facing “an existential crisis,” as S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell told ADWEEK’s editors—but little of that fear was present on stage. While celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Schwarzenegger took center stage, and teams posed with gold trophies on the red carpet, executives on the ground spoke with ADWEEK about issues such as AI, agency consolidation, and layoffs. The event was also marked by an aggressive land grab, both for literal pieces of the Croisette and for marketing budgets. Certain power struggles were visible throughout the festival: Adobe versus up-and-comer Canva, both of which upped their budgets for activations this year. Amazon versus… everyone else. And Michael Kassan’s 3CV versus his former company, MediaLink. Even in the creative awards, rivalries–such as that between holding companies Publicis Groupe and WPP–were on display. Publicis Conseil, a jewel in the crown of the former holdco, won both Agency of the Year and the Titanium Grand Prix, while WPP was named Creative Company of the Year. In the latest episode of Adspeak, the ADWEEK editorial team reports from the sandy beaches and hot pavements of Cannes about who came out on top at the festival, what’s behind the parties and beachfront activations, and what Cannes says about where the industry is headed.

Title: An elegant and hefty cheeseburger bento awaits at the “Japanese Costco” Lopia

Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese It’s so classy, you’ll want to eat it with a knife and fork. There’s a supermarket in Japan nicknamed the “Japanese Costco” because much like its namesake, it sells very large quantities of food at bulk-discount prices. Its real name is Lopia, and our writer Ikuna Kamezawa often enjoys going there even though many of the things for sale are way too big for her to ever eat on her own. But this time, a certain cheeseburger bento caught her eye. It was large, but not too large, and only cost 1,078 yen (US$7.40), so she decided to take the meaty plunge. It was so big that she could barely fit it into her shopping bag and things only got worse as it started to rain while she walked home. She had to carry it very carefully too, for reasons we’ll see in a moment. After getting home, she unveiled her Manpuku Burger Double Cheese and confirmed its size at about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Popping the lid off we can see that the very fancy arrangement was why Ikuna had to carry it so carefully, and the sheer volume of it all was the reason it was priced a little more than a Big Mac combo. She felt kind of bad disturbing the elegant layout of her bento, but she had to take stock of what was inside before eating it. There was a double cheeseburger with two patties and two slices of cheese, some seasoned fries, and two breaded chicken filets. That photo might not do the size justice so she took some shots alongside a pack of matches for scale. Sure, a matchbox might not be the most universally understood comparison, but she was just so excited to eat this thing. ▼ Fries ▼ Chicken Filets ▼ Double Cheese Burger Ikuna turned her attention back to the cheeseburger and tried to reassemble it in a normal way. That’s when she noticed something was off with the proportions of the bun and patties. She thought this must be some chic designer cheeseburger arrangement she’d never seen before. That might give the illusion Lopia is being chintzy with the meat, but rest assured they were good-sized beef patties. For a more understandable comparison, Ikuna placed a Yamazaki Bakery convenience store cheeseburger next to it. This store-bought burger selling for about 99 yen is slightly smaller than a McDonald’s cheeseburger and the Lopia burger blows it out of the water. ▼ Lopia’s burger ▼ Yamazaki’s burger There were definitely some structural integrity issues with it though, so our writer opted to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork. A fancy burger like this deserves fancy eating utensils anyway. The hamburger patty wasn’t juicy at all, but it was very dense and meaty. This texture might turn some burger aficionados off, but she felt kids would really go for it. There was also a sweet ketchup on it, but really the flavor of the beef stood out so much that she barely even remembers eating the cheese and bun. While it might not be for everyone, the taste of this burger bento was right up Ikuna’s alley. Her only complaint — if you could call it that — was that it was too much for her to eat in one sitting. But for the price she paid, that’s the kind of problem you’d want to have. In conclusion, she definitely recommends the Manpuku Burger Double Cheese for big eaters. Lopia can be a little random with their offerings, especially in the bento section, but Fridays are known as “Fry Days” there which is when they usually go all out in that department so your best chance is to find it then.

June 23, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

Title: Apple might buy Perplexity AI to bolster AI division
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/23/apple-might-buy-perplexity-ai-to-bolster-ai-division/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T20:35:07Z
Full Content:
Apple is still considering its AI moves, and now it seems like the startup Perplexity might be on the menu. A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple is weighing the pros and cons of an acquisition that could help it acquire more AI talent and products. On the flip side, there are reports that Apple might partner with the company instead of buying it. This partnership could lead to an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and integrating the company’s tech into Siri. The report says Apple has made no formal offers, but has met with the company several times lately. This deal and/or partnership is likely spurred by two things. First is the potential for Apple and Google’s deal for search on iPhone to evaporate as U.S. courts look at Google as a monopoly on the search market. Apple is also seen as behind the competition in AI, and a major move like this is bound to be good for the stock price. The Bloomberg report mentions that Google’s stock fell a point after the news went live about Apple’s possible AI acquisition. There’s also some speculation that Sam Altman and OpenAI’s deal with ex-Apple design legend Jony Ive on some AI hardware might be putting pressure on Apple to get into the AI game sooner rather than later. That being said, Apple is working on its own AI tools, so it’s likely a matter of how long it thinks those will take to make and how much the company actually cares about what Wall Street thinks. There is an argument to be made that with Apple’s dominant market share in the iPhone, it can likely afford to be a few years late to the AI game, especially since we’ve seen so many issues with the current crop of generative and search AI tools. However, previous reports said Apple’s top executives are split on AI adoption, so things might be stalling in either direction. The report also mentions that Meta has already made an offer to buy Perplexity, but the companies couldn’t come to an agreement, so Meta invested in Scale AI. Perplexity’s CEO says that Meta even tried to poach them for its ‘Superintelligence’ team. Meta has also approached staff from OpenAI and offered salaries with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta’s investment in Scale was US$14.3 billion, (C$19.6 billion), so it stands to reason that the company offered a similar deal to Perplexity. The AI startup is valued at US$14 billion (C$19 billion) after its last funding round, so I expect it will cost even more if Apple wants to buy the company. The big question I have at this point is, if Apple is considering making big AI moves, will that delay some of the already announced features, like the Siri enhancements we’ve been waiting for since WWDC in 2024?

It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj I’ll circle back to ChatGPT and the fundamental reason it is not going to replace Google search. Ed Zitron has demonstrated beyond a doubt that it is not financially viable, not at the free level, not at the premium level. Their last best hope seems to be a turn toward surveillance tech but they’re going up against Palantir and multiple incumbents there. Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” my pleasure as always to post for this wonderful community. And yes, Zitron and Gary Marcus are my go-tos on AI scepticism. Zitron on the business side and Marcus on the tech fundamentals. We are in the midst of the biggest Ponzi scheme in human history. “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! thank you for the kind words and the analysis of AI’s summary of Ahab’s speech. Oh the lulz. Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. thank you NM. It’s entirely possible you’re correct. Google execs just have to be smarter than I’m giving them credit for or its the biggest deliberate destruction of shareholder capital in my lifetime. Amazon, Oracle and MSFT are definitely using AI to make cloudside plays but I don’t see Google cracking the top 3. However I think there remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in delivering high quality search — you know, the kind Google had up to about 2015 or so. It may be a situation where we are both correct to an extent. Don’t forget that Alphabet also owns DeepMind, which I would argue is one of the largest AI companies (that has certainly been overshadowed by others like OpenAI recently). In the Project Nimbus contract (the deal between the Israeli state and AWS and Google Cloud to build 6 “soverign” data centres), Israel stated specifically that they chose Google and AWS over Microsoft and Oracle because of their increased AI capabilities. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. As a reader of NC for over 20 years I am truly humble to have posted the post that triggered this conversation. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology. See companies like Kodak and Blockbuster that failed to adapt. This is more like Kodak choosing to abandon film for disappearing ink technology than any kind of film vs digital ink debate.

Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025.

Title: Tesla shares pop 10% as Elon Musk touts ‘successful’ Robotaxi test launch in Texas

Full Content:
Tesla’s Robotaxis appeared to violate local traffic laws by exceeding the speed limit and swerving into the wrong lane – even as Elon Musk touted a “successful” launch of his long-delayed self-driving vehicles and shares popped as much as 11% Monday. In one video posted by investor Rob Maurer, a Robotaxi appeared to struggle navigating a left-turn-only lane, briefly crossing over a double yellow line before returning to the proper lane. A human motorist honked at the Robotaxi during the glitch. Meanwhile, Tesla investor and superfan Sawyer Merritt posted a video from his Robotaxi ride in which the driverless car accelerated past 30 mph speed limit during Sunday’s rollout in Austin, Texas. YouTuber Herbert Ong described a similar experience in his video, according to Bloomberg. “It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said in the video. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.” Bloomberg later reported the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking information from Tesla after seeing the online videos of issues on robotaxi after its debut. Despite the apparent hiccups, Tesla shares surged after a handpicked group of influencers who participated in the trial run uploaded positive reviews on X and other social media platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, raved about his experience after taking two approximately 15-minute rides in the state capital. “Going into it, we expected to be impressed but walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future,” Ives said in a note to clients. “The ride itself was completely smooth, and it was indistinguishable that the car was driverless as there was never a moment in the vehicle where we felt as if it did something irrational.” Ives maintained his “outperform” rating for Tesla’s stock and a $500 price target. The electric car maker began offering driverless rides by invitation only on Sunday, with riders charged a $4.20 flat fee — a cheeky nod to marijuana use. About 10 driverless Tesla Model Y SUVs were reportedly on the road, with company “safety monitors” on board in the front seat to oversee the trips. Bearded Tesla Guy, a social media influencer, compared the experience to “basically Uber.” Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla employee-turned influencer, said his rides were “very smooth and comfortable.” “Now Tesla needs to scale this service safely,” Mesbahi said on X. “As long as the system performance holds, they should be able to cover the US with Robotaxis virtually overnight.” Robotaxi is set to directly compete with Google-owned Waymo and Amazon-backed Zoox in the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla told US regulators that all of its answers to questions on the safety of its robotaxi deployment in Texas are confidential business information and should not be made public, according to a letter released Monday. On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to the agency’s questions about the safety of its self-driving robotaxi in poor weather among other issues. The agency said Monday that federal law “restricts NHTSA’s ability to publicly release what the companies label as confidential.” The agency added that “following an assessment of these responses and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.” On Sunday, Musk shared “super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!” “Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. Invitations circulated by Tesla said the initial Robotaxi service would be available from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM local time and limited to a geofenced area, meaning anything outside the pre-set boundaries would be off-limits. Tesla also said Robotaxi service would be limited or unavailable in the event of bad weather. Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” technology, though federal regulators and other critics have repeatedly raised safety concerns. He has suggested that autonomous driving technology can add $5 trillion to $10 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization by transforming its vehicles into an instant productive fleet. The billionaire had said the Robotaxi rollout was limited because Tesla was “being super paranoid about safety.” The debut occurred at a critical time for Tesla, whose shares have been under pressure since Musk embarked on his controversial work with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Trump had a very public falling-out earlier this month, though the two have since appeared to mend fences. With Post wires Advertisement

U.S. equities advanced at midday as oil prices declined on doubts the weekend U.S. military strikes against Iran and possible retaliation from Iran would disrupt supplies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Tesla (TSLA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 when CEO Elon Musk said the launch of the electric vehicle (EV) maker's robotaxi in Austin, Texas, was a success. Northern Trust (NTRS) shares jumped on a report the bank was approached by Bank of New York Mellon (BK), or BNY, about a possible merger. BNY shares fell. Shares of fintech firm Fiserv (FI) rose on a plan for a new stablecoin. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) dropped when the drugmaker's new experimental obesity drug wasn't as effective in reducing weight as hoped. Meantime, Novo Nordisk ended its agreement with Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) allowing it to offer Wegovy to customers, sending shares of the telehealth firm plunging. Shares of struggling silicon carbide chipmaker Wolfspeed (WOLF) cratered when the company announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it moved to restructure its debt with key lenders. Gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid. The U.S. dollar was up on the yen but lost ground to the euro and pound. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher. TradingView

June 23, 2025 10:52 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Young Investor Demand for Alternative Assets Is Reshaping Wall Street's Playbook

The financial industry is rushing to keep up with millennials' and Gen Z's interest in pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles and more. June 23, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street has a new favorite investor. They’re young, they’re affluent and they’re skeptical that traditional markets can deliver wealth over the long haul. Shaped by financial crises and fueled by tech optimism, this well-heeled class of Millennials and Gen Z are moving their money into the buzzy world of alternative assets. Think pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles, and more. From private banks to fintech platforms, the financial industry is rushing to keep up. Firms like Forge Global Holdings Inc. have lowered their minimum investment thresholds, pitching private-market access as aspirational — and attainable. At Bank of America Corp., the number of retail clients holding alternative assets has more than doubled since 2020, and the firm adds about 50 new funds to its platform each year. Nearly three-quarters of wealthy investors under 43 believe a traditional stock-bond portfolio will fail to generate above-average returns, according to BofA’s biennial study last year. About 93% plan to increase allocations to alternatives in the coming years. The irony for Wall Street’s old guard: many in this alt-loving crowd are turning away from the very public markets that helped build their wealth in the first place. Related:RIAs and the Evolving Landscape of Private Wealth “Investor preferences are changing at the same time that the markets are evolving,” said Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank. “Those two dynamics are at play that are feeding off of each other.” The demand is reshaping how Wall Street pitches wealth-generating products. What used to be institutional is now increasingly being redesigned for individuals, albeit the well-connected and well-funded. Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are among investment firms repackaging their once-elite strategies for the masses into ETFs and semi-liquid funds. The 60/40 model — allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds — delivered respectable gains over much of the past decade. But its appeal has dimmed since 2022’s inflation-driven rout, as both assets began moving in lockstep, eroding the diversification benefit of the strategy. “Some advisors may have just used the 60/40 portfolio over time and haven’t really felt the need to offer something in the way of alternatives,” said Mark Steffen, global alternative investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “But I think that’s probably changing.” Supply is on the rise. A CAIS survey shows 80% of alternative managers plan to launch retail-friendly products and structures, nearly double from three years ago. Morgan Stanley, for instance, just filed to offer a multi-asset vehicle designed to provide exposure to everything from venture capital to private debt, real estate and infrastructure — all in one fund. Related:The WealthStack Podcast: Unlocking Private Markets with AssetMark's Michael Kim Many investors are opting into complex, costly, and often illiquid structures — even as the long-term payoff remains uncertain. Compared to tax-efficient ETFs, these alternative products tend to carry higher fees, greater opacity, and less liquidity. Blackstone’s flagship real-estate trust, for example, hit withdrawal limits during the 2022 interest-rate spike. With private equity and credit poised to trail public markets for a third year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists recently advised their clients to reduce exposure to both assets. A separate academic study has labeled alts “costly and wasteful.” And Moody’s Corp. warned the push to open private markets to the retail crowd carries “systemic implications,” such as growing liquidity risks. Yet none of this is deterring industry fans in the era of get-rich-quick antics amplified on social media from TikTok to Reddit. “I can tell you it’s most often easier to convince an entrepreneur to put money into a 1-in-10 shot startup than it is to get them to park money in a conservative, long-term strategy,” said Brian Werner, chief investment officer at Winthrop Partners. Related:Carlyle Makes New Retail Fund Push to Buy and Sell PE Stakes Earlier this year, when Forge cut the minimum investment on selected offerings to $5,000, daily sign-ups more than tripled. Executives say the surge largely came from young users riding the AI wave — hoping to access firms like OpenAI before an IPO. Part of the appeal is cultural FOMO — the chance to signal early participation in the next major tech boom. “A lot of them have a tech background, so they’re playing in their own sandbox with stuff that they know,” said Andrew Saeta, co-head of US capital markets at Forge. “The stocks-and-bonds model of our parents isn’t necessarily getting the job done in their eyes, especially with everything being so expensive.” While the trend appears most pronounced among Millennial and Gen Z types, it’s pulling in a broader cohort. Chad Blackburn, an accounting executive in Nashville, Tennessee, started buying equities in his teens. Today, the 45-year-old largely avoids stocks and bonds, putting most of his capital into startup firms and — yep — Bitcoin. “The dotcom bubble and great financial crisis forced me to think more deeply about my investments,” he said. “Why would I limit myself to just stocks and bonds, especially when a lot of this stuff is not nearly as diversified as you think?” For many, alts aren’t just about returns, they’re a form of rebellion. Even among those who have benefited from the market’s gains, there’s a lingering distrust in the institutions that helped deliver them. They view public markets and 60/40 strategies as fragile or even rigged, having coming of age during the crashes of 2008 and 2020. Real estate, digital currencies, and private equity now rank among the top picks for this emerging wealth class, according to BofA. The appeal is both psychological and financial: these assets are seen as detached from government interference and more likely to deliver big upside. “They think, the system is rigged against me,” said Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management. “I have to do something out of the box in order to get rich.” Read more Wall Street Has a Hot Way to Sell Private Assets to the Masses Apollo, Franklin to Offer Private Assets in Empower 401(k)s Blackstone, Vanguard, Wellington to Launch Private Markets Fund One reason that alternatives are being aggressively repackaged for individuals is that traditional buyers — pensions, endowments, insurers — risk being tapped out. Big institutions allocate about one-fifth of their portfolios to alternatives, according to Preqin. By contrast, individuals in the BofA survey show an allocation of only 7%. But painting alternatives with a broad brush can be misleading. According to Chris Toomey, managing director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, private credit and infrastructure appeal to older investors thanks to the promise of steady cash flows, though for the young cohort, private equity looks more attractive. “They are at a point in their investment cycle where they have the ability to take on that risk,” Toomey said. “They’re early investors and they’ve got a much longer time horizon.” Yet even among the younger generation, the shift in taste isn’t universal. For every investor chasing unicorns on Forge, there are thousands of Millennial and Gen Z savers. According to Vanguard Group Inc., many in this group are sitting on high cash holdings thanks to cash-default IRAs — at the expense of fully investing their capital in diversified portfolios. There’s no monolithic investor and no single truth about alternatives. But the future of wealth management won’t resemble the past — and Wall Street is already rushing to profit from the generational shift. “You’ve got this mix of investor preferences and product availability evolving in a way that they actually compliment each other to create this procyclical uptake in alternative investments,” said BofA’s Pelzar. “We’re probably in the early innings of a real wave.” Lu Wang You May Also Like Celebrating outstanding achievement in support of financial advisor success Jun 27, 2025 Jun 27, 2025 Jun 26, 2025 Sponsored Content Serving the whole client: Why ignoring estate planning is bad for business Sponsored Content The 2025 WealthStack Study: How Technology Is Transforming Wealth Management Growth and Reshaping the Industry Sponsored Content Open Finance in Action: How Data Connectivity Drives Advisory Value Sponsored Content Modernizing Wealth Stewardship | How Trust & Wealth Managers Are Adapting to HNW Family Expectations Featured WMIQ Research Tracking investment and wealth management decision-makers’ views and progress on data modernization.

Title: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod says dating AI chatbots is ‘playing with fire’

The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. Today, I’m talking with Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod. Hinge is one of the biggest dating apps in the United States — it’s rivaled only by Tinder, and both are owned by the massive conglomerate Match Group, which has consolidated a huge chunk of the online dating ecosystem. A fair warning here: I’ve never actually used a dating app — the algorithm that matched my wife and me was the university housing lottery, which put us in adjacent dorm rooms in the fall of 2000. And my wife is now a divorce lawyer, so playing around with these apps seems a little bit risky. So I always end up approaching conversations about dating apps a little bit removed. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! I asked Justin what it’s like to be the married CEO of a dating app company who doesn’t use his own product anymore, especially as his own personal romantic journey is very intertwined with Hinge. The entire idea of the company and how it has evolved over the years connects to Justin’s own life and his decision to reconnect with his college girlfriend, just a month before she was supposed to marry someone else. The story is so unbelievable that it was turned into an episode of Netflix’s Modern Love. You’ll hear Justin explain how that experience connects to the company’s values, culture, and his vision of what Hinge is really for — and how all of that is geared toward helping people find lasting connections. Hinge bills itself as the app that’s “designed to be deleted,” and that, of course, is in deep tension with how mobile apps and services grow users and revenue. Then there is the AI of it all. Hinge, as part of Match Group, is using AI both internally and within its product, just as Tinder and other competitors are. There’s AI coaching features to help you improve your profile, pick better photos, and even catch an inappropriate message before it gets sent. But pull the string on all these ideas, and you get to a place where people might be talking to AI all the time, even falling in love with it, or having AI agents dating each other before meeting in person. Justin had some pretty strong feelings about the importance of centering real human connection and encouraging people to put their phones down and go out on dates in the real world. Justin also called the idea of AI companionship “playing with fire” and compares those relationships to junk food. There’s a lot more in this conversation. We got on the topic of the Trump administration and how seriously Hinge takes the privacy of its users’ data during an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. We talked briefly about Apple and its App Store restrictions, now that companies like Epic Games and Match Group are free to send people to the web to process in-app purchases. Hinge has some plans that you’ll hear Justin get into near the end. There’s a lot going on in this one; you might even fall in love. Okay: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Justin McLeod, you’re the founder and CEO of Hinge. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to talk to you. I’ve got to tell you, this is one where I feel like Jane Goodall or a sociologist of some kind. I’m old. I’m married to a divorce lawyer. I can’t even download this app. It’s too risky. I’m watching through the looking glass here. I asked my younger staff for their Hinge feature requests. Don’t worry, I’ve got a million of those. Great. Excited to hear those. When TaskRabbit comes on Decoder, I’m like, “I booked a TaskRabbit.” This is very different. When was the last time you actually used Hinge as a user? Over a decade ago. Wow. Yeah. What’s that like? What’s it like trying to run this team? Is it all just data driven for you, because there’s a real element of dogfooding here. Yes, definitely. We have a lot of single people on our team at Hinge, so there’s a lot of internal dogfooding for sure, and a lot of opinions. I think that the relationship is different. So, I started the company in 2011, and I was single at the time, and I was single for the first four years of Hinge, and then, long story: I got back together with my college girlfriend, and we’ve been together for the last 10 years, married with kids and all. Did you get back together on Hinge? We were together. I tried to get her back. She said no. I started Hinge in response to that. And then someone whom I met on Hinge inspired me to go back. She was about to get married to someone else. She was living in Switzerland. I flew over a month before the wedding. She called off her wedding and moved back to New York, which led to the whole reboot of Hinge. The whole story is very interconnected. I feel like I should throw out my questions. We should just do an episode of Call Her Daddy or something like that. That sounds very complicated. Yeah, it’s been a ride. An incredible ride, and very intertwined with Hinge. But back to your question, I think that we can overweight our own personal experience a bit, especially as the CEO of the company. What I found over time is that people have a wide array of very diverse experiences, and to some extent, I think it actually helps that I’m not in there overweighting my own niche feature requests that would matter to me but not to the whole population. So the app has evolved. It’s more about helping others than it is about helping myself, which was probably the original idea of Hinge. How do you think about the connection between what the data is telling you, the data about what Gen Z daters are doing versus millennial daters, which is the cohort you started with, versus the very emotional experiences people have on this platform, which are out of your control? Eventually, you’ve got to take the meat sack to the bar and look at the other person and not fuck it up, right? Hinge can’t solve that problem, but that’s the heart of the whole enterprise. How do you connect those two in your brain? This is a very complex, nuanced industry. I think sometimes people look at their Hinge feed and they’re like, “Why doesn’t this understand my taste as well as my TikTok feed does?” People don’t quite understand that people aren’t products; they’re not infinite copies of everyone.They don’t always behave the same. Your videos on TikTok don’t have to like you back. There’s just a lot of nuance to getting this right. And you’re right. A fair amount of this comes down to the people on the platform. So what we’re trying to do is to [not only] build a great product but also an environment and a community where people are encouraged to be intentional and authentic, and attract users who are looking to find their person. So that’s definitely the art and the nuance of trying to build a dating app like ours. One of my big criticisms of social media apps right now in 2025 is they’ve all become marketing platforms in some way. At the end of the rainbow, Mr. Beast is trying to sell you an energy bar. That’s what they’re for. And smaller creators are trying to get their first-brand deals or whatever. But there’s a real organization around just marketing. And the platforms try to encourage people to create content for a whole number of reasons, but their reason for being is advertising spend, and then a lot of the content creation on the platform happens for marketing purposes. You can just see how it goes. Hinge and other dating apps are different. You’re trying to incentivize content creation. You’re trying to get people to talk about themselves, to talk to each other. The goal is to market yourself. How do you divorce that from the actual thing you’re trying to do, which is to have people fall in love and get into stable relationships? Well, it’s very much about what you’re optimizing for. And you’re right; social media is ultimately optimizing for engagement, retention, and time in app. That is the lifeblood of any of these companies. How long can they keep you sucked in? That is their objective, and so everything is built around that. And we’ve seen what the consequences of that are. They’re pretty dire. I think Hinge is almost the polar opposite of that. We’re trying to get you to spend less time on your phone and more time out in real life on dates. It’s interesting. When I started Hinge back in 2011, as venture capitalists looked at our business they asked those questions around engagement and retention. They were looking at social media, and they’re like, “What’s your daily over monthly? How much time are people spending in the app? How many sessions per day?” We were optimizing for those things, because that’s what VCs were asking about. That’s how we were raising money. Then Hinge did a pretty big pivot in 2015, when I let go of half the company and we rebooted from scratch, because we felt as if we’d really lost our way. We’d become more of a piece of entertainment that was just about getting people more matches and more activity, and getting them back every day. We’d lost sight of what we were trying to do, which was to have people come to us to find a relationship. We weren’t really optimized around that anymore. When we did that pivot in 2015, the biggest change we made was to stop focusing on the competition. We started focusing on the customer, and we made our North Star metric actual great dates. We introduced the “We Met” survey, where we asked people we suspected had gone on a date if they did in fact go on that date and whether it was good. Everything became oriented toward optimizing for that. That ended up creating a very, very different experience. That actually became the primary differentiator of Hinge. A lot of the other apps in the industry were based on engagement and retention and just getting people back; they were more like entertainment platforms. Hinge became a utility. We started growing through word of mouth, and today we’re the fastest-growing, and in fact the only growing, major dating app. We grew 40 percent last year, while other dating apps are shrinking, because we built a very sustainable business model that delivers on value. The lifeblood of our company is getting more users out on dates, so they tell their friends and then their friends come and join Hinge. The interesting thing about that business model is it’s in the tagline of the company. I always laugh when you all put out a press release, because it says, “Hinge, the app designed to be deleted,” and then a little trademark logo follows every time it’s mentioned, which is just very funny. I appreciate that you have to do it, but it just makes me laugh every time. That means you’re trying to graduate users. You’re a utility, you pay until you’re done, and then you’re out. Yeah, precisely. It means you constantly have to find new users. You basically have a different churn problem. How do you think about that life cycle? We think about it in terms of good churn. We want people turning off the app for the right reason. We don’t want people turning off the app because they gave up too early or because they don’t like Hinge. We want people turning off the app because they found someone, ideally on Hinge. What does it mean to find somebody on Hinge? Like you’re married? You’ve gone on three dates? It’s different for different people. When we did the reboot, our core market was definitely 25- to 35-year-olds, and very much people who were, I would say, looking to find their person and get off the app. Now our fastest-growing segment has been 18- to 25-year-olds, and they’re at a different phase in their lives. It was pretty interesting. When we saw that segment starting to grow, it came as almost a surprise to us. I think what attracted these younger daters wasn’t so much a focus on finding a long-term relationship, or a marriage partner today; it was very much about the authenticity and vulnerability and intimacy they found on Hinge, and a moving away from platforms that felt very gamified and flat to something that felt very human and intentional and authentic. So we think about our daters as having a journey mindset. They’re headed in a direction, they’re on a journey of self-exploration. They don’t want to waste their time on bad dates, but they aren’t necessarily looking for their marriage partner today, and that’s totally fine. We’re just looking to help people get off the app and out on great dates, and form intimate connections in real life. But there’s a difference between getting off the app and going on great dates, and then deleting the entire thing, right? Forever, yes. There’s one exit ramp that is very different from another exit ramp. Not to keep comparing it to social media, but again, I feel as if I’m just viewing this from the outside, so it’s all metaphors for me. Mark Zuckerberg is terrified that young audiences will just abandon his core app, or whatever the core social media dynamic is at the time. This is why he bought Instagram. You can read his emails over the course of these trials. He’s like, “There’s another mechanic. I need to buy it before they overtake us.” Zuckerberg keeps going down the line, whether that’s Stories or Reels or whatever the next thing is. You have the same problem, only you don’t get to keep the old users on the old mechanic. You don’t get to run Facebook and buy Instagram. How do you think about reinventing the app for that new, younger cohort that has different dynamics on the internet? We always stay in tune with where the culture’s going. I think it’s just imperative, because, you’re right, we can’t rely on only a legacy user base. So we have to stay on top of culture and where it’s going, and then continually evolve the app accordingly. Right now, a big focus is on AI, and how we can increase the effectiveness of the app in a couple of different dimensions. We’re actually finding, for example, the extent to which coaching has become really, really important right now. Especially during the pandemic, we saw social skills atrophy. People felt less comfortable meeting up with others in real life and interacting. So we’re helping people create their profiles, write their prompts, things like that. Another big thing that came out during the pandemic was more of a focus on voice, and adding voice prompts, which I think is, again, an example of our moving where the culture goes. So we’re always making these kinds of tweaks to continually keep the app fresh. Do you feel the same existential pressure? There’s this idea that some cohort of people will delete the app — the old millennials will be married or tired or whatever it is they’re going to do, and you’ve got to go get a bunch of new Gen Z users or Gen Alpha users, which is frankly terrifying. How do you think about, “Okay, we’ve got to break the old model, because it’s existential for us if we don’t capture the younger user,” or is it more of a gradation? If you look at the relatively brief history of this industry starting in the ‘90s, there’s only been one major disruption moment, which was around 2012. So you had the birth of the industry in the late ‘90s, where you had Match and eHarmony come on the scene, and then they dominated from 1996 to about 2014. It was actually a much smaller niche industry at the time. The users were older, people who felt as if they’d really struggled to find someone in real life. Then you had the mobile dating apps come on because of a few different technologies that started to come online all together — one was mobile, one was the cultural change of everyone having a social media account. Another was data-processing power and moving away from the world of searching for people to a world of a feed of relevant people, one after another. That created a pretty big paradigm shift, where suddenly technology enabled an entirely new type of experience that it was hard for the old incumbents to mirror. They tried to pivot to mobile, but they couldn’t unseat themselves from their way of thinking about the world. It resembles a very classic disruption problem. I think the next opportunity for that kind of disruption is going to be a big technology shift. We haven’t seen that up until very recently. Like with VR, AR, and other technologies like that, I just don’t see those working until they’re deeply adopted by 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, and that’s when I think it will really become something that people start using for dating. AI I think is a very different story, and it’s unclear at this point whether it becomes a disruptive force for the current players or whether it becomes more of an evolution. Obviously, Hinge has a tremendous amount of data we can use to train AI models. We’re seeing huge gains in our ability to match people up more thoughtfully given the tools, and at the same time we could introduce very new paradigms for dating. I want to talk about AI with you, but you mentioned Match, so I think this is a good time to get to the Decoder questions. You’re part of Match Group. You sold to Match Group, and now Match Group owns all of the dating apps minus one, which is a little contentious. It doesn’t own Bumble. There’s a lawsuit. We can set that aside. What’s it like being part of Match Group? When you sold your company, what was that decision like for you? Honestly, at the time we were in a tough position as a company. I’d done the reboot, and we were about a year into that reboot experience, and we had not really cracked the code yet. There were green shoots there that made me believe and made, I would say, the trained eye believe that there was really something there. But VCs just saw that we were popular, and then we tore down our business, and we restarted, and we started to rebuild again. There wasn’t a lot of juice there. So we went with a strategy of recognizing the value of what we were seeing, including massive increases in effectiveness, women coming to the platform in a much higher proportion than on other dating apps. So that was very interesting to Match. And so we received a strategic investment from the company in 2017, and that gave it a path to buy the rest of the company, which it did at the end of 2018. What’s that structure like inside of Match Group now? It’s evolving. There’s a brand-new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who just started, and I think he’s taking a fresh look at some of that. But up until recently, and still today, the company operates pretty independently. We’re in New York. We pretty much have our own space. We have our own product teams, our own engineering teams, our own marketing teams that operate very independently. We share learnings across the platform. We use shared services like accounting and legal and things like that. But for the most part, the company has its own independent culture, its own independent mission, product road maps, marketing strategies, all of that. You said you shared some central services, like accounting and finance. Is there any product or data that you’re sharing? We certainly share learnings. Especially on things that we don’t really want to compete on, such as safety or monetization or things like that. So there’s certainly that, and there’s sharing for safety purposes. Those are the main ways we share. So if you’re a young and carefree single on Tinder, and you graduate to Hinge, you don’t get to just bring your data along for the ride? [Laughs] No. Again, I’m just looking from the outside. Tinder is interesting. The CEO of Tinder just stepped down. Your new CEO at Match, Spencer, stepped in to run Tinder for a minute. In any normal circumstance, you would be on the attack. If Tinder wasn’t part of the same company as you, this would be a moment to say, “Okay, there’s some strategic weakness over there. We’re going to go get them. We’re going to put the screws on.” Are you allowed to do that inside Match Group? So first of all, I’ll just say that we don’t really think too much about Tinder as Hinge’s competition. We think about Tinder in a very different psychographic mindset. You come to Hinge because you want to really take your time, be intentional, be thoughtful, find your person. Tinder has a much more casual, younger, “anything can happen” mentality. And so that was a very intentional portfolio strategy decision that Match made back when it acquired us. So no, we don’t think about it like that. That’s why I asked about the data and the lifecycle question. There’s a time in your life where you might use Tinder, there’s a time in your life where you might use Hinge. It seems from the overall umbrella company perspective, you want to move that user around your family of apps, but it doesn’t seem as if that’s actually happening at the top level. Yes. From the outside that would make sense. It’s a bit nuanced, because there are very different brand reputations. We like to think of Hinge pretty independently, and I think so do our users. So there’s no pop-up on Tinder that’s like, “Maybe, it’s time to cool it and download Hinge”? There’s not. [Laughs] Okay, feature request for you. What’s your org chart like? How is Hinge structured? That’s also been evolving over time, and we’re still a relatively small company. We have about 350 employees. If I think about the evolution of Hinge growing from one person to the first 100 to 150 people, originally, it was very centrally run. There was tight coordination. A lot of direction came directly from me and my executive team. Then as we started to grow beyond 100 people, I would say a lot of the technology was relatively stable. Like with social, mobile, big data, the question became, “How do we keep optimizing and iterating around this?” We became a pretty decentralized organization, where we had principles around pushing decision-making down to the lowest levels possible, keeping it really on the front lines. We had pretty independent cross-functional product teams that would work on their individual little missions or surfaces. We oscillated back and forth between that. People felt they had a lot of autonomy. That was the main ethos of the company. And then I think with AI over the last couple of years, we felt like, “Whoa, we really need to make a pretty big shift.” Like I said, the risk of disruption is high, with very big opportunities to shift the product experience in a new direction. It now requires pulling decision-making back in toward the center a bit, and giving a much clearer strategic direction to the team, so that we’re all working in concert toward one thing. Because the whole app really has to move together. Different parts of the app have to talk to each other in ways that when we weren’t going through much change, wasn’t as essential. That said, we still have very highly cross-functional product teams where product managers sit with a dedicated designer, researcher, data scientist, and tech lead to attack very mission-oriented problems. You mentioned “surfaces” and “missions.” Are those expressed as just the tabs at the bottom of the app? Is that how they’re broken down, or are they actual user journey missions? That’s what I mean — surfaces versus missions. I think we’ve gone in different directions. There’s never really a clear line of one versus the other. Do you own the Discover tab, where users just discover new people, or is your job to help people find the right person? In that case, you have to think more cohesively about operating across different surfaces or parts of the app. Now we think about our teams operating less as individual surface units and more as part of a cohesive dating-outcomes team, where people feel a bit more flexible moving around to different surfaces. How do you think about assigning product managers to those teams? Because PMs, at least in my experience, are like, “I own this square, and I will mess with this square to make this number go up as much as I can.” But “I can mess with all the squares” is really hard, right? Yes, that’s why we have strong directors at the VP level who oversee an overall mission the way that a head of dating outcomes or a head of growth, who’s coordinating a set of product managers, would. And again, we ask our PMs. Their primary identity is as a dating outcomes PM, not as a discover PM, or a profile PM, or something like that. And while day to day most of their work may focus on the profile and identity work, they see themselves as very much operating as part of this team. That feels like something you evolved to. You’re a relatively young founder. I think you founded the company right out of Harvard Business School. How has your decision-making framework evolved? How do you make decisions? That’s also hugely evolved. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned through doing it all the wrong ways first and then eventually getting to the right way. When you’re a founder and you have a small team of 10, 20, or 30 people, you’re just making decisions by the seat of your pants. What feels good? What feels right? You’re just using your own gut. As we started to get toward 100 people or so, what I noticed was I would be making different decisions on different days that weren’t always consistent. They were based on my mood that day or whatever data was in front of me or what I had last read or whatever. I was just finding I was getting pretty inconsistent. So what I started trying to do was to write down my whole management algorithm. I started putting it in a Google Doc, like “Here’s how I make decisions, here’s what I believe is true.” I started publishing that to the whole company, so everyone could just read it. We would be just very transparent about how we made decisions. It was around the time that I think I read Ray Dalio’s book Principles, and got super dialed in on how we make decisions. What are our principles, and what do we believe is true? Then I opened it up so everyone could comment on it. We would have long debates in the comment margins of a Google Doc to consider everything from our product-strategy principles to whether Hinge should have a dress code. Literally anything. It was all just there so that everyone could debate it. We had hundreds of principles, and then as the company got even bigger and we got to 300 or 400 people, it was very hard. One, you just can’t have these endless debates in Google Docs anymore. Also, the principles started to stabilize. There wasn’t as much debate and churn anymore, and then it actually became an exercise in distilling down the most essential things to communicate about our culture. I worked a couple of years ago to write an internal book called How We Do Things, which distilled it all down to four or five principles. For example, what are the most fundamental things to understand about how we make decisions here? And then individual teams and individual projects would then write their own principles that were more specific to what they were doing at any given time. One of our meta principles now is “decide with principles,” meaning that we don’t want decisions getting made based on some random person’s opinion that if tomorrow this person leaves the company and we hire someone else, they’re going to come in with a completely different set of ideas about how to do something. We really try to define our principles first, agree on those principles, and then see how our work maps to them. I’m happy to talk about what the other three principles are if you want, but that’s the framework we use to make decisions now. Yeah, talk about them a little bit. There’s a beautiful website, we’ll link to it. It has storytelling, it’s well done. But tell people what the other three principles are. So the next one is “love the problem.” What I would notice is we would get an inclination around a user problem, which maybe was not even validated 100 percent. Then we’d start getting feature ideas, and we’d get very attached to a feature, and sometimes the feature would drift and not even be solving the original problem. What I found was, if you want to build breakthrough innovative product features and products, you have to spend extra time with the problem to really understand the why behind the why behind the why of of it. You need to ask, “What’s really going on here? Can we really get deep into our users, into the data, into our users’ experiences?” You have to go to that level to get insight that just isn’t available on the surface, and then stay really committed to that problem. And that’s what, again, allows for innovation. I think for a lot of Silicon Valley, the strategy is just to throw feature ideas against a wall and see what sticks: “Let’s see if this works. Oh, it doesn’t work, throw that out, let’s try something else.” When you have a lot of deep conviction around a user problem, and you really know you want to solve it, then you have the resilience to try and try again to solve that problem, even if your first or second iteration doesn’t make it. So one of the most foundational of our principles is, “love the problem.” Fall in love with the problem, don’t fall in love with the solution, as you must be willing to give up the solution at any given time if it’s not solving the core problem that you’re trying to solve. So that is “love the problem.” Next is “keep it simple,” meaning that I think the best solutions are always the most elegant solutions. Overall, we want to keep the product very simplified and minimal. Our colors are black and white. If you look at the Hinge product today, it’s very clean, it’s very simple. We’re always stripping away features that don’t make sense and just recognizing that there’s complexity. There’s a cost to complexity every time you add a feature. So even if you add a feature, if it’s only marginally beneficial, the cost of the complexity and maintaining that feature versus the marginal benefit it adds will end up gunking up the app over time and slowing you down over time. That’s a hard conversation to have with product managers, because they’ll work for months on a feature and they’ll ship it and say, “Yeah, it didn’t harm the user base, we like it, and it even moved this metric over here by 2 percent.” And you’re like, “Well, the cost of complexity is high, and so we need to focus on things that are actually going to have a major impact.” Are you all the way two features out for every feature in? Do you think about it that way? I know some founders do. I haven’t heard that before. I don’t necessarily think that way. But I do believe in constantly reevaluating what’s in the app, asking what needs to stay, and having a high bar for building a new feature. So does it actually accomplish what we need it to accomplish, and is the complexity worth the cost? So that’s the third one now. The fourth, the last one, is “tend to trust.” I just find that trust is the lifeblood of an organization. You have to do a lot of work to proactively cultivate and tend to trust by creating strong interpersonal relationships, by creating lots of opportunities for transparency at the organization. We have always been very, very transparent about where the organization is headed. So much so that we had to make all Hinge employees Match Group insiders so they couldn’t trade Match Group stock except during trading windows, because we would be so transparent about where we were, what our financial position was. Everyone should know that all the way down to any position at the company. I think the trust that you create both interpersonally and from the leadership on down to the rest of the organization is absolutely essential. It just saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to internal politics and all those types of things. Let’s put this into practice. You obviously made a big decision to refocus on AI. How did that come about? Did you wake up one day and say, “Oh boy, it’s happening”? Was it that Match Group put out a press release with OpenAI saying, “We’re going to work together”? Did you read that and say, “I got to figure this out”? How did this come about? Certainly the release of whatever version of ChatGPT that sent shockwaves through the world was a pretty big wake-up call. Obviously, we’d already been using machine learning and things like that in the interest of safety, and in our algorithms, our recommendation algorithms. But I think the shot across the bow that came from the release of ChatGPT [with GPT-3.5] was what really woke us up to the potential capabilities here and to realizing that this could be a major disruptive force in a way that we hadn’t really seen since we started Hinge. It took a bit for us to get our strategy clear about what our thesis was on how this was going to affect matching and dating in the future. It wasn’t immediately apparent, but I think we have a pretty clear thesis now, and we’ve started to organize the company around that thesis. What’s the thesis? That there’s two main vectors that AI is going to impact: dating and matchmaking. I think the big story is AI is going to move Hinge much closer to the experience of working with a personalized matchmaking service, and away from the experience of feeling that you are joining a social platform on your own as you try to find your person. So what does that mean? Two big pieces. One is personalized matching, and the other is effective coaching. On the personalized matching front, we should be able to move much further beyond the world we are in today, which is our users speaking to us in essentially Morse code as they try to communicate to us what they like and what they don’t like. The idea is that they would be able to speak much more directly to us with “here’s what I’m looking for, here are my values, here’s my personality, here are my interests.” It means Hinge being able to listen to them and hear their preferences, and even integrate things like relationship science into the app to better understand what types of people are compatible and what types of people are not long-term compatible, and introduce them to a much more curated, higher-quality, less-quantity list of people, where they have much more trust that if you’re introducing them to this person, this is probably someone they want to go out with. We’ve already seen big gains, by the way, just by using the power of LLMs to drive more of our recommendation systems using the data we already have. But we released a new algorithm a couple of months ago that increased matches and dates by like 15 percent, and that’s just using the same data. But now we can start to use much more of that unstructured, nuanced data, with people talking to us in their own voice about who they are and what they want, which we can use very effectively. So that’s the whole personalized matching front. Then there’s the effective coaching front. A lot of our users struggle to get out on that first date, and they often don’t know why. I have friends who are incredible people, and they’ll ask me to take a look at their Hinge profile. I’m flabbergasted that this is their attempt at putting themselves out there. So we’re starting with pretty basic things. Hinge has these prompts, which are short questions designed to get you into a conversation, and you put them on your profile. A lot of people write great responses to prompts, but a lot of people write not-so-great responses, often just one-word answers that just don’t work. We found it’s just incredibly effective to have trained an AI model on good-prompt responses and give people feedback. And it’s mostly like, “Can you say more about that?” [Laughs] Don’t just put “no.” Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific and tell a little bit of the story. Good answers invite another question back, or get a conversation going. So we can give people those nudges so they write good prompts, so that they choose good photos. We have a team called Hinge Labs, which is always looking at why some people succeed, and why some people don’t on the app. Some of it is, again, simply building product features that help solve those problems, but another part of it is just giving guidance and notes about how they can be using the product better. We have traditionally published those in date reports, and we publish them in the press and we place them in the help center. But for the most part people just don’t read them. But the idea that we can take this body of knowledge we have about how to succeed on Hinge, and then look at how our users are using Hinge, and then deliver the right piece of advice at the right time to the right user, I think is going to be pretty transformative for a lot of people. There’s a pretty fine line between that and what I see lots of people already doing all day long, which is just talking to ChatGPT, just hanging out. We had Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of Replika, on the show, and she said, essentially, “My plan is people are going to date AI bots that will coach them up into being fully formed people, then we’ll release them into the dating pool, and they will have confidence and self-assuredness.” Again, there’s a fine line between prompting someone and coaching them inside Hinge, and we’re coaching them in a different way within a more self-contained ecosystem. How do you think about that? Would you launch a full-on virtual girlfriend inside Hinge? Certainly not. I have lots of thoughts about this. I think there’s actually quite a clear line between providing a tool that helps people do something or get better at something, and the line where it becomes this thing that is trying to become your friend, trying to mimic emotions, and trying to create an emotional connection with you. That I think is really playing with fire. I think we are already in a crisis of loneliness, and a loneliness epidemic. It’s a complex issue, and it’s baked into our culture, and it goes back to before the internet. But just since 2000, over the past 20 years, the amount of time that people spend together in real life with their friends has dropped by 70 percent for young people. And it’s been almost completely displaced by the time spent staring at screens. As a result, we’ve seen massive increases in mental health issues, and people’s loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I think Mark Zuckerberg was just quoted about this, that most people don’t have enough friends. But he said we’re going to give them AI chatbots. That he believes that AI chatbots can become your friends. I think that’s honestly an extraordinarily reductive view of what a friendship is, that it’s someone there to say all the right things to you at the right moment The most rewarding parts of being in a friendship are being able to be there for someone else, to risk and be vulnerable, to share experiences with other conscious entities. So I think that while it will feel good in the moment, like junk food basically, to have an experience with someone who says all the right things and is available at the right time, it will ultimately, just like junk food, make people feel less healthy and mo re drained over time. It will displace the human relationships that people should be cultivating out in the real world. How do you compete with that? That is the other thing that is happening. It is happening. Whether it’s good or bad. Hinge is offering a harder path. So you say, “We’ve got to get people out on dates.” I honestly wonder about that, based on the younger folks I know who sometimes say, “I just don’t want to leave the house. I would rather just talk to this computer. I have too much social pressure just leaving the house in this way.” That’s what Hinge is promising to do. How do you compete with that? Do you take it head on? Are you marketing that directly? I’m starting to think very much about taking it head on. We want to continue at Hinge to champion human relationships, real human-to-human-in-real-life relationships, because I think they are an essential part of the human experience, and they’re essential to our mental health. It’s not just because I run a dating app and, obviously, it’s important that people continue to meet. It really is a deep, personal mission of mine, and I think it’s absolutely critical that someone is out there championing this. Because it’s always easier to race to the bottom of the brain stem and offer people junk products that maybe sell in the moment but leave them worse off. That’s the entire model that we’ve seen from what happened with social media. I think AI chatbots could frankly be much more dangerous in that respect. So what we can do is to become more and more effective and support people more and more, and make it as easy as possible to do the harder and riskier thing, which is to go out and form real relationships with real people. They can let you down and might not always be there for you, but it is ultimately a much more nourishing and enriching experience for people. We can also champion and raise awareness as much as we can. That’s another reason why I’m here today talking with you, because I think it’s important to put out the counter perspective, that we don’t just reflexively believe that AI chatbots can be your friend, without thinking too deeply about what that really implies and what that really means. We keep going back to junk food, but people had to start waking up to the fact that this was harmful. We had to do a lot of campaigns to educate people that drinking Coca-Cola and eating fast food was detrimental to their health over the long term. And then as people became more aware of that, a whole personal wellness industry started to grow, and now that’s a huge industry, and people spend a lot of time focusing on their diet and nutrition and mental health, and all these other things. I think similarly, social wellness needs to become a category like that. It’s thinking about not just how do I get this junk social experience of social media where I get fed outraged news and celebrity gossip and all that stuff, but how do I start building a sense of social wellness, where I can create an enriching, intimate connection with important people in my life. The connection between the wellness industry and the rise of social media is a whole other podcast, and maybe a PhD thesis, too. There’s a whole lot there to unpack. I take your point though, that maybe using our phones in healthier ways is the future. It will make us better, and that will be a reaction to the negativity we see from phones today. Literally as we speak, I’m sure Elon Musk and Donald Trump are continuing to tweet at each other in an unhealthy way for maybe the future of the entire planet. But you’ve got to use AI today. You have prompt feedback running in the app today. You’re helping people pick better photos. The flip side of that is that they might just use AI to generate the content. Can you detect it if your prompt feedback says, “Hey, that’s not a good answer,” and someone runs away to Gemini or ChatGPT and comes up with a better answer that doesn’t actually reflect them? I think about this like the extreme photo filters, which used to be popular on Instagram back in the day. Ultimately, you are going to have to go meet up with this person on a real date, and so you want to come across as best as you can, because, obviously, you’re not going to bring ChatGPT on your date with you. I’m worried about this. I want to say that I’m worried about this. So it’s not a winning strategy. That said, do people ask for advice and little tweaks? They already do it today. They ask their friends, “How should I respond to this text message?” So in some sense, I don’t see it that differently, because you will have to meet up with this person eventually and show up as the real you. Would you add that feedback inside Hinge? Hinge obviously has messaging features. Are you going to add a little coach into the messaging feature to say, “Hey, don’t be a dick”? That already exists. It’s called “Are You Sure?” That’s AI-driven to make sure people don’t send inappropriate messages. But yeah, again, the right nudge at the right time, because I think if we build the right tools within Hinge that are appropriate for dating, people will then use it and be less likely to run out to ChatGPT and use [the feedback] in ways that are probably less appropriate. Nudging people to say, “Hey, you guys have been chatting for a bit. Did you know that most people, after they exchange this many messages, usually just go on and move to a date?” Or, “Hey, it seems like the conversation has died. Here’s something interesting that you may not have noticed on their profile that you can ask about.” Little things like that, certainly. One of the interesting dynamics here is you’ll add more and more AI to the digital experience people have with each other to make them perform better or act better or be more interesting, whatever it is. And then they’ll go on a date, and then they might leave your platform. They might switch to iMessage or call each other on the phone. I don’t think Gen Z is calling each other. They’ll do something else. They’ll go on Discord. How do you bring that experience along for the ride to say, “We’re going to continue to stay here and help mediate and coach you through this relationship”? We’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do just to get people out on the first date. And at the same time, I do think there’s actually a lot of opportunity to help coach people through that experience. How to show up on a first date. What to talk about on a first date. How to build intimacy over time, how to ask about the right things to determine compatibility. So I think there are definitely opportunities for that. It’s not on the 2025 road map, but it’s certainly something I’m thinking about. Do you worry that people are going to just upload full AI avatars on Hinge and catfish each other to death? We have a very robust trust and safety team that is thinking two to three steps ahead about how to mitigate things like that. I have spent too much time talking about watermarks in AI and SynthID, and there’s lots of episodes of the show that are deep in the AI watermarks game, and it has effectively come to nothing so far. There’s just a lot of problems there. Are you able to say, “Okay, we can detect a full AI photo here”? There’s so many signals when it comes to creating a dating profile from the phone number you use and the email you use and your IP address, all those things like that, that we have a very multifaceted way of determining the authenticity of profiles. I’ll say that. Running these models is costly. There’s lots and lots of different kinds of models you can run at different costs. Are you using lots of models? Are you sending everything to GPT-4? How does this work for you? We use different models for different things. Sometimes we build them completely internally. As you said, it’s public that we have a relationship with OpenAI. So we use different things and are always balancing cost and performance against our ability to build in-house versus not. Do you see that trend shifting over time? I’m very curious about what the frontier models can do versus what the cheaper, more efficient models can do. Have you seen that shift over time as you’ve started to deploy these tools? For one, we’ve seen the cost of the frontier models just decline precipitously, which is pretty interesting to watch. But I’ll say that there are models, even the prompt feedback model, that are very, very specific and discrete, and that we can mostly build internally to understand. Do you run that in your cloud and your data center? Or are you running that on people’s phones? I don’t actually know. I think that’s in the cloud. I’m almost positive that one is in the cloud. The reason I’m asking is that to do any of this well, you need more and more data from people, and you’re asking them to generate more and more data. For instance, “That’s not a good answer; tell me more about yourself,” is more data and it’s data that you’re now storing. In particular, it’s data about gender, sexuality, and dating preferences — that’s stuff the government suddenly has a very unusual and somewhat threatening interest in. Are you worried about that? That the Trump administration or some future administration would show up and say, “Tell me all of the transgender people on your platform”? Obviously, we have very, very sensitive data that we have very, very clear protections around. And we haven’t seen anything like that. So you haven’t had any of those incoming requests yet? No. The Trump administration has also said it’s going to start scanning social media profiles for references to Palestine, and for comments about Trump himself. When you talk about matching people and values, those things come up. Has there been any request for Hinge profiles from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE or any of these other parts of the Trump administration that are doing this social media scanning? No. The reason I’m asking is the amount of data you might collect is very, very personal. It seems like a rich target. Have you thought about the planning for how big of a target this might become as you prompt people to input more and more data with AI? Certainly. I think we’ll have to handle those things as they come. We’re obviously in a very uncertain time right now, but I will say that we are primarily a platform about creating intimate one-to-one connections where people should be able to express themselves in the way they see fit, and describe themselves and their own sexuality and their own gender in the way they need to do. That will inevitably touch on people’s very private lives. I view that as absolutely sacred and fundamental to our mission, and people feeling safe to express themselves is absolutely critical. So those would be our very highest priorities, and I imagine not top priority for social media, where people are blasting posts to thousands, or millions, of people. Our platform is not about one-to-many posting and conversation. It’s about intimate one-to-one connection and one-to-one conversations. I think I would warn you that having a data pool of that kind might make you a target. I’m curious how that plays out over time, particularly in this administration. There’s some platform dynamics here as well, like iOS and Android exist. They are platforms. They’re also themselves rich targets for the government. Overall, there’s a push for the platforms to do age verification themselves. There’s laws now in certain states, and in other countries, that the Apples and the Googles of the world have pushed back against in various ways. Do you think they need to do it? Do you think that it’s at the iOS and Android level that you need to do the age verification? Because this is a core component of bringing people onto Hinge. It’s not for children. It’s certainly not. We’re 18-plus and we have our own age verification methods. But yeah, we have been pushing for these platforms to do age verification themselves because they have even more robust ways to do it. The arguments in response — when you listen to Apple and Google push back against these laws — is that it would be too hard. It would create a censorship regime, that the app vendors need to be liable for this. Have you seen any movement in that dynamic? I think at the highest level, this is one of the big dynamics of how we might regulate platforms in the future. I am staying much closer to product development and where we’re going with AI right now than I am to that. Your monetization method is obviously a premium version of Hinge. I think one tier is $55 a month. There’s another tier that’s $45 a month. The big news in the platform world is that Apple is no longer allowed to prevent alternative payment systems. Match Group, in particular, has been leading this fight. It’s in all the press releases. Has that changed the dynamics of Hinge for you? I don’t know if it changes the dynamics, but it’s certainly going to give us more flexibility in giving users options to be able to pay in different ways. I think that’s good for everybody for sure. Have you launched an alternative payment service yet? We have not. Would you like to? Yes. How soon? Certainly by the end of the year. Is that going to be a Match Group payment service or a Hinge payment service? How do you think about that? These are things that we’re figuring out, but most likely Hinge. That would return somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 30 percent depending on how the billing works for you at your scale and recurring subscriptions and all that. Is that just going to be pure margin? You’re just going to get the money back? Well, I think it changes the equation on many fronts. It allows us to invest more in the company. It changes how we would price, so no, I think it could result in lower prices. It could result in more investment in the company, or it could result in more margin. It’s probably some combination of all three of those. Match Group has been doing this fight for a long time, and you’re already describing how you might change pricing or the lifetime value of customers. Fortnite maker Epic Games fought this fight for five years. At the very end, the judge says, “I’m very mad at you, Apple. You can’t do this anymore.” Did you immediately start making plans that day or were you like, “This is going to get appealed, we have to wait”? There’s been back and forth and appeals and stays and things like that. I think just a couple of days ago, the appeal was denied. So I think that made it pretty real. Just to put the decision-making into practice, did you say that day we need an alternative payment system? Certainly the day that the original ruling came out, we started to plan. What does that planning look like? Is it, “I’m going to call Stripe”? Put us in your shoes. That happens. Someone comes to you and you say, “Okay. We need to start to plan.” Walk us through that moment. Just like anything else at Hinge, I think that we stay grounded in our principles. We look at the big picture. We look at the teams and the road maps and the things they’re focused on right now, and we think, “Does this new information change anything? And as we look at our growth team, does it make sense to build the next monetization or expansion feature? Does it make sense to pivot resources over to this thing?” And given, as you said, the 15 percent to 30 percent gain that’s on the table, it’s a pretty high priority. There’s an ecosystem of companies that might be building this stuff more centrally, that might be charging different rates. I’m excited about that. It’s wonky and boring. There’s a reason we’re ending the episode on payment systems. A whole new industry I think will emerge. Well maybe not an industry, but certainly a suite of services will emerge around this to allow people to manage subscription payments, cancellations. It’s certainly nuanced. But at the end of that, what you want is rates to come down. Where do you think the rates should be? I know no one has ever thought they should be at 15 percent or 30 percent. Where do you think they should be with a little more market competition? When you stack the credit card payment processing fees on top of the fees around customer service and all the nuance of managing those, I do think it comes down to the 5 percent to 10 percent range. When you think about recovering that up to 20 percent, are you thinking, “Okay, I can use this to lower prices and grow,” or is it that you have to build many, many more AI features to compete against the coming onslaught of AI chatbots? [Laughs] I think we’re very, very focused on innovating for the future. Like I said, it changes the equation, so it’s on all three fronts. It’s lower prices, it’s higher margin, and it’s more investment in the company. But it certainly gives us major opportunities to invest in the core product experience at a time when there’s massive disruption. So it’s a particularly critical time to be doing that. There’s a lot of talk about platform shifts. You’ve talked about platform shifts here. People might be using Hinge differently, because they have AI tools or because the AI tools are helping them find one another more efficiently, or better. A lot of the platform shift I hear about is, “Oh, we’re going to have new devices. We’re going to have new form factors. People are just going to talk to ChatGPT in the bar.” Maybe we’ll just have agents that represent us, and they’ll go on dates for a while, and come back and say, “You should go on this date with this other person we found on Hinge,” because the agents have fallen in love, and now you just have to not screw it up. That takes the screen away. That takes your surfaces and your missions and puts them in a totally different place. How are you thinking about that level of shift? Is it even on your radar? Yeah, I’m thinking about it right now. I think we overuse the form factor of our mobile devices right now for all kinds of things that it doesn’t need to be used for. I think a lot of those will be siphoned off into some other form factor. I especially think audio and voice is going to be a very big piece of it. But I don’t think that means that the form factor completely goes away. There are things that you need visual cues and references for where a screen is still going to be the dominant form factor. At least a piece of the dating equation is going to be that, for sure. Do you think we’ll get to a place where people’s agents are just dating each other and then reporting back? No, I don’t really think so. I think there are much better– Isn’t that what’s already happening in the matchmaking algorithm, in a very reductive way? Isn’t that what’s going on? I think in a very abstractive, reductive way, you could say that. But that’s not really what’s happening. We are not simulating dates. I think it’s a very expensive and inefficient way to do something that is actually much more straightforward. There’s just a part of me that says you’re going to have some competitor that attempts this, and we will all have to contend with it. I just think that’s a bit of a red herring for trying to map someone’s psyche and guess how they’re going to act. That adds a lot of complexity when actually you can just talk to people very directly about who they are and what they’re looking for and what matters to them, and compare that against someone else and what they describe, and actually make a lot of good connections and [get a] clear understanding in figuring out who should match with whom. Justin, this has been great. Tell people what’s next for Hinge. What should they be looking for? It really is the evolution of the product. I think that the shift to AI is going to be bigger than the shift to mobile for the industry. If you think about the big picture of what mobile did, it just made the process more approachable, faster, more fun, easier. But it was still the same fundamental experience of just cruising for people and trying to find someone based on very limited information, matching with them, trying to figure it out, going on a date, realizing this is not your person, trying to find the next date. We’re moving much closer to a world of really deep understanding of compatibility. Being able to zero in on the right person very quickly. It’s going to be a very transformative experience that I think is going to very much change people’s understanding and perception of the industry. So I’m really looking forward to the next couple of years, because I think that we will see more change than we’ve ever seen in the industry before. We’ll have to have you back to check in on how it’s going. Thanks so much for coming on Decoder. Great. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Title: Defense And Energy Holdings May Help In New Climate

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A Dassault Rafale C fighter jet. Dassault Aviation is one of 23 stocks currently in my model ... More portfolio. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, with the possibility of retaliation by Iran, poses new risks for U.S. stock investors. With four defense stocks and two energy stocks in my standard portfolio, I feel reasonably well positioned. Once a year in this column, I give a snapshot of my holdings in a typical medium-risk account. My biggest concentration at present is in industrial stocks, most of which are defense stocks. U.S. relations are tense with China, Russia, South Korea and of course Iran. I own Dassault Aviation SA (DUAVF) in France; BAE Systems Plc (BAESY) in Great Britain; and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) in the United States. A quasi-defense holding is Babcock International Group Plc (BCKIY) of Great Britain. Babcock services reactors in nuclear subs, and does other nuclear work. Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (STRL) does engineering and construction, with a specialty in data centers. Its stock is up more than 800% in the past three years. My final industrial holding is Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI), which makes refrigerator coils and other plastic and metal parts. I expect the U.S. stock market to run into some trouble in the next few months, partly because of international strife and rocky federal budget negotiations. Therefore, my second-biggest concentration is in health-care stocks, because the health sector usually holds up pretty well in rough markets. I own Chemed, the largest U.S. hospice operator, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a large insurer and operator of medical practices. In pharmaceuticals, I own Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Sanofi SA (SNY) in France, and Novo Nordisk AS (NVO) in Denmark. I’m fairly light in technology stocks – lighter than I want to be, in fact. Most clients have about 5% of their money in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which makes chips for most major semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom. Also weighing in around 5% is Jabil Inc. (JBL), best known for circuit-board assembly. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is classified as a communications services stock, not a tech stock, but it has an undeniable tech flavor. It is the parent of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. I’ve long been a fan of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), so it’s not surprising that JPMorgan is in my portfolio. I also hold Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc. (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan (which holds a 23% stake in Morgan Stanley). A small holding is First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank Index Fund (QABA), an exchange-traded fund that holds shares in about 100 small and medium-sized banks. I also own Berkshire Hathaway, which is a conglomerate but is classified as a financial stock because of its extensive insurance holdings. This is the domain of Warren Buffett, considered by many the dean of U.S. stock pickers. Buffett has said he will step down as CEO at the end of this year. Among consumer stocks, my biggest holding is Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), the largest U.S. egg producer. I also own Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH), a mid-sized homebuilder in a fragmented industry. Meritage concentrates on the sunbelt, where growth is faster than in the Northeast. Given my concerns about the market, the federal budget deficit, and the fraught international scene, I think it’s prudent to own some gold now. Most of my clients have about 6% of their money in SPDR Gold Share ETF (GLD), which represents a share in a large pool of physical gold. An old favorite sector of mine is energy. Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG) is a pure play on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. TotalEnergies SE (TTE) is the largest oil company in France, and also has significant operations in solar and wind. When I buy a stock, my desired holding period is usually three years or more. But in practice, my average holding period is about two years. Some of the stocks I recommend today will doubtless be out of my portfolio a year hence. In most columns, I include a disclaimer: Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Since today’s column is about the stocks I actually own, I will give my firm’s actual performance (on a composite of individual accounts). In the 25 ¼ years through March 31, we have achieved a cumulative return of 764%, compared to 511% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index. In the 12 months through March 31, however, we trailed the index, 5.35% to 8.25%. Disclosure: I own all 23 stocks recommended in today’s column, both personally and for clients.

Meritage concentrates on the sunbelt, where growth is faster than in the Northeast. Given my concerns about the market, the federal budget deficit, and the fraught international scene, I think it’s prudent to own some gold now. Most of my clients have about 6% of their money in SPDR Gold Share ETF (GLD), which represents a share in a large pool of physical gold. An old favorite sector of mine is energy. Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG) is a pure play on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. TotalEnergies SE (TTE) is the largest oil company in France, and also has significant operations in solar and wind. When I buy a stock, my desired holding period is usually three years or more. But in practice, my average holding period is about two years. Some of the stocks I recommend today will doubtless be out of my portfolio a year hence. In most columns, I include a disclaimer: Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Since today’s column is about the stocks I actually own, I will give my firm’s actual performance (on a composite of individual accounts). In the 25 ¼ years through March 31, we have achieved a cumulative return of 764%, compared to 511% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index. In the 12 months through March 31, however, we trailed the index, 5.35% to 8.25%. Disclosure: I own all 23 stocks recommended in today’s column, both personally and for clients.

Title: Amazon Ramps Up Enshittification With Even More Ads On Prime Video

Full Content:
(Mis)Uses of Technology Back in early 2024 Amazon announced that Prime Video customers (who already pay $140 per year) would be charged $3 extra every month just to avoid ads that didn’t previously exist. It was just the latest example of “enshittification” in a streaming sector all out of original ideas, desperate to provide Wall Street with impossible skyward quarterly growth — regardless of consumer annoyance or brand harm. When originally announced, Amazon promised it would try to keep the ad load to three-and-a-half minutes per hour to try and be less annoying than its competitors. But the march toward enshittification yields to no one; 18 months later and Amazon has already doubled that volume of advertisements per hour: “According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.” In the modern era it’s simply not allowed for a public company to offer people an affordable product everyone really likes. The unyielding pressures for quarterly growth at any cost inevitably result in the cannibalization and enshittification of most of your favorite products. It’s obvious everywhere; but particularly in newer industries (like say, video streaming) that were disruptive just a few years earlier. Amazon has told eager investors but hasn’t bothered to communicate the latest enshittifcation to consumers yet. When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) and if it was it would be okay because Amazon is focused on “improving ad experiences”: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” As new growth in streaming customers has slowed down, giant media companies have relegated to seeking old ways to give Wall Street their sweet, sweet, improved quarterly returns. That means not just price hikes, but layoffs, pointless mergers, less money spent on content and residuals (meaning they’re too cheap to keep popular programs online), and crackdowns on things that used to be consumer benefits, like the lax treatment of things like password sharing. The short term stock boosts and tax gains from this kind of gamesmanship and consolidation disincentivizes execs from learning anything useful from the experience. By the time consumers begin a backlash and the brand begins to tank, the executives who led the charge are already off working at a different company on the basis of their “savvy deal-making prowess.” It’s purely extractive and utterly pathological. Consumer interest, employee welfare, and the long term integrity or quality of the brand or product simply have nothing to do with it. In this case, streaming companies are going to keep pushing their luck until piracy sees a massive resurgence (which is already starting to happen), at which point the executives will blame everyone and everything but themselves. Instead of any sort of self-awareness of the doom cycle they participate in, they’ll do something even more harmful: like lobbying Congress to make VPNs illegal. Filed Under: ad load, advertisements, amazon prime, competition, consumers, enshittification, streaming, tv, video Companies: amazon Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown So they’re going to stop showing ads? Hold on, they didn’t say they were gonna do that—just that they’re “committed to” doing it, whatever that means; it’s certainly not a guarantee you can collect on. And, of course, they didn’t say it would be an improvement for the viewers. Maybe they’ll “improve ad experiences” for the advertisers, but I suspect the real improvements be for their own employee-bonuses and for Jeff Bezos’s pocketbook (which may imply accidental short-term benefits to minor shareholders, too). Thank God! I sure was getting bored of watching shows without ads! Giving up Amazon Prime turned out to be much easier and painless than I expected, and that was before they started enshittifying in earnest. Amazon in general turns out to be ridiculously easy to walk away from. I highly recommend doing so. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.

When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) […]: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” This is not a lie, just your standard marketing double-speak. It doesn’t say what Karl says it does. It never actually says ad load isn’t increasing, or won’t be increasing. Rather, it avoids the question entirely, and answers an unasked question about their “commitment” instead. Even their “commitment” is compatible with increasing the number of ads shown, as long as they’re not “simply” doing that. “Improving ad experiences” (for whom?) could include increasing the number of ads. That’s not “simply increasing the number”; it’s increasing the number, combined with doing some other stuff. People have been complaining about the enshittification of Amazon’s shopping site for about a decade now, to no avail. Apparently, counterfeit products are a big concern. I don’t shop there, but I do come across Amazon links from search engines sometimes, and it’s astounding how often (for the last year or two) I’ve seen errors about something failing on Amazon’s end, and asking me to try again. When it does work, even if the search has a brand name, the screen’s often full of other brands instead, and I have to scroll to find whatever the search was for. And most reviews aren’t without logging in now. The thing to remember about Amazon Prime is that most of its customers probably never subscribed because of the streaming. They subscribed for the free shipping, and maybe at some point started watching the video service because it was bundled. If Amazon can get them to not watch the video service, but to stay subscribed, that’s the ideal outcome. Youtube already have dominated the news about war against adblocking, copied Hulu’s pause ads on TV and mobile app, and introduced double non-skip ads. Amazon charges you AND serves you ads. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads (other than sponsors content within the video, if the content creator does that). BIG difference there. You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You’re just one person, and evidence suggests this is not a widespread view. Newspapers and magazines generally did both, plus abused people’s personal data by selling it to postal spammers. (While dead media may not be a great example, that’s not the reason it died.) You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. That’s why I’ve never had a subscription for Sky. Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. They haven’t. I had cable TV (via older relatives) in the 1980s and 1990s, and don’t recall the provider advertising except on the TV guide channel (and maybe the bills, and radio and TV stations). The main ads anyone saw were from the broadcast channels that the cable provider was being paid to relay. What were they gonna do, black those out? Eventually, cable-only networks did appear, some of which had advertising. That sucked, but, again, it was done by the channel providers, not the cable providers. A lot of people, by the way, have been telling satellite and cable TV providers to take a hike. Techdirt’s written about “cord-cutting” many times—but, at this point, I think it’s kind of done, and subscriber counts are going down more due to death than cancellation per se. (If you haven’t watched live television in a while, you may not have noticed that the ads have become targeted to old people—hearing aids, motor-reclining chairs, etc.) I see you have no experience of Sky or Virgin Media in the UK and the former company’s illegal nine-minute-long ad breaks (supposed to be nine minutes per hour, not per ad break), which they have despite also charging fees. Remember: just because you haven’t personally experienced something doesn’t mean it’s never happened, just like we don’t have masked individuals abducting foreign nationals off the streets here, but I don’t believe that’s not happening in the US. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads Maybe not on YouTube, but are they still collecting viewing data and using it for ad targeting elsewhere? Fuck Hulu. – 🇨🇦 “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences Translation: “Our commitment is to ramp up our spying and data mining even more, so as to present viewers with advertisements for items, for example, that they’ve talked about in the presence of an Amazon Echo” Every thing you want to watch on it costs extra. What are you even paying for? What are you even paying for? Generally, people are buying it for the free and faster shipping. Sure, Amazon touts other benefits such as video, but it’s best for them if people don’t use any of that. Preferably not even the shipping benefits (there are ways to get them for free without Prime, and if a subscriber falls into such patterns by accident, their Prime subscription is just free revenue for Amazon). Last I checked uBlock Origin worked on Prime Video ads, but it’s been a little while since I watched Prime Video. In biology, unchecked constant growth is known as cancer. And if capitalism is not brought under control, it will go on to drive humanity right to extinction. I wouldn’t mind the commercials if they were more relevant to my interests. Yes, I know people find relevant ads to be creepy and intrusive, but my point is that Amazon already collects so much data about my shopping habits that I shouldn’t see the same drug ads that I see on regular TV. I stopped watching CBS This Morning because it became drug ads interrupted by a news segment. If I were advertisers, I’d be more picky about the data that the streaming services provide. Do people interact with the ads, such as scanning the QR code, or ignoring it? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? I don’t know what’s cheaper, but I think the bottom line is that advertising companies are able to convince their clients that, whatever it is that the ad company is doing, it’s working. I mean, their business is basically to sell people stuff they don’t need; that doesn’t just apply to the ad viewers. Or if they weren’t the same damn 2 commercials over and over again? Streaming was only ever of value when it was more convenient than piracy. That is no longer the case. It is worse. I paid for ad free, but it has suddenly gone away. Bye Amazon i got’s me one of them raspberry pi’s. it’s nicely loaded with ad blockers! so the likes of prime and you tube can fuck right off! 100% add free! well almost….some video’s have sponsored ads presented by the channel host/ maker. but that can be skipped through. YouTube Premium has rapidly increased in cost over the few couple of years. All the content is freely produced by content creators – nothing is paid for directly upfront any more as far as I know. The content creators are constantly complaining about the lack of revenue. Alphabet keeps promising “improvements” for the increasing price. But as a user I struggle to think of a single improvement, let alone one that benefits me. There are heaps of features I’d love to see but there is no process for users to offer feedback, the only feedback is from content creators and advertisers. If the price increases don’t benefit me or the content creators , that leave one last beneficiary of the price hikes… Over the years I have successfully “voted with my wallet” away from so many services but YouTube really feels like a monopoly – I paid for Pandora for a year but its just too small and found myself just going back to YT. I think only an antitrust action can save the users from Alphabets unbridled greed. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Have a Techdirt Account? Sign in now.

Title: I had a comfortable life in Big Tech, but something unsettled me. I quit to start my own company — now I feel more fulfilled.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/quitting-big-tech-entrepreneur-stock-compensation-concentration-risk-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-23T10:03:13Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 41-year-old Srikanth Narayan, the CEO and founder of Cache, from the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My career began in San Francisco. I've been in Silicon Valley ever since, working at both startups and Big Tech companies. In 2021, after roughly eight years working at Uber and then Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, I decided it was the right time to take a leap and become an entrepreneur. I had built a healthy financial cushion and was ready to take a risk and create a new company. I noticed a problem around Big Tech compensation — concentration risk. I saw an opportunity to help build a solution and educate employees on this risk. Entrepreneurship has been a lot harder than working in Big Tech, but I've found it far more fulfilling. Prior to founding Cache, I spent most of my career focusing on data visualization. In 2014, Uber recruited me to lead a data visualization application suite. I stayed at Uber for six years and eventually became a staff engineer. If you work at a company like Uber for a long time, a lot of your compensation is in the form of stock, sometimes outsizing your cash compensation. As the company grows and does well, your net worth grows in line with the stock. This creates wealth for the people who hold that stock, but having way too much of your net worth in a few stocks means you're taking undue risk. Take Tesla. In recent months, some people who worked at Tesla may have seen their net worth fluctuate due to the changing value of the company's stock. People tend to hold on to these massive stock positions due to inertia and because the taxes for reallocating stock can be very expensive. I joined Uber at a good time. The company mostly did well and went public in 2019. All of the wealth I had accumulated in stock became real money on the open market that I could sell or trade. However, I had a lot of low-basis stocks that would trigger a high capital gains bill if I sold them. When I joined Waymo in 2020, my Alphabet colleagues talked about similar problems. I found this issue unsettling. A steep drop in stock price at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic affected my portfolio. I hired a wealth manager to help me find solutions for concentration risk. They showed me products that help people of high net worth manage concentration risk. One option is depositing concentrated stock into an exchange fund where others have done the same, and receiving fund units in return. This method can diversify your portfolio while deferring capital gains taxes. It sounded like a great product, but none of my peers had heard of it. It seemed to only be available at private banks, and only for people of a certain net worth. From what I saw, the exchange funds required a lot of human operational coordination. There seemed to be little innovation in this area to improve efficiency. I saw a massive business opportunity. I wanted to make products like this more efficient and available more broadly. I resigned from Waymo in late 2021 to start my business, Cache, which I formally launched in March 2024. We're a specialized brokerage for people holding large stock positions. Our flagship product is an exchange fund that helps people diversify their portfolios. My experience at Uber gave me an understanding of how to turn an idea into a full-blown vision as a founder. I designed products at Uber that became widely adopted within the company. This took engineering work and entrepreneurial spirit. However, moving from corporate life to building a company myself involved a lot of learning on the job. There wasn't really a manual I could follow for building an exchange fund, so we had to do a lot of R&D. There were many steps involved, including working with the SEC and FINRA to get the right registrations, since the industry is highly regulated, and building the technical infrastructure for a brokerage system. I was one of the first users of my own product, and I invested a lot of my Uber stock in our exchange funds. Running a startup is very different from working at a Big Tech company. I'm probably working triple the time I was before. Being employed in Big Tech was a very comfortable life. You worked on challenging problems and got paid well to do it. While I enjoyed this, I also wanted to figure out my own path. The entrepreneurial journey has been more fulfilling. I've had to go through personal trials, such as not paying myself for the first year after leaving Waymo. Because of my financial cushion from working in Silicon Valley, the stress of this didn't really bear on me. I'd made sure I had several years of living expenses in reserve before taking the leap. Becoming an entrepreneur requires drive and conviction. It's a very hard journey, and often, market forces will be against you until they start working with you. The glamour of being a startup founder or of an exit is the wrong reason for forming a company. It should be about self-fulfillment and a passion for building something from scratch and making a change in the world. Do you have a story to share about leaving Big Tech?

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement These go-to Alexa commands save time, simplify tasks, and make daily life easier. If you have the latest Echo Dot with Clock, you can start using these voice commands today. Alexa has come a long way since its early days as a basic voice assistant. What once felt like a novelty for playing music or checking the weather is now a powerful tool for managing your entire home. With the launch of Alexa Plus and its new AI-powered features, Amazon's voice assistant is smarter and more capable than ever before. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a must-have tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now is the perfect time to see how much more useful it has become. with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.
