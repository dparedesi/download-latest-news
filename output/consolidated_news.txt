The largest asset manager in the world is buying the Ethereum dip to custody funds for its ETH-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock’s data, the firm picked up 100,535 ETH – worth about $276.2 million at time of writing – for its iShares ETHA product. BlackRock holds a total of 1,352,934 ETH worth roughly $3.71 billion, and the financial giant’s total assets under management were reported to be around $11.5 trillion in October of last year. And according to on-chain data, the President of the United States’ crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is also accumulating Ethereum, with blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reporting that WLFI also purchased over $307 million worth of ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and sent it to Coinbase Prime for management purposes. In a recent strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. The analyst gave a price target of $20,000 for ETH. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000.

Title: Amazon's earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Amazon (AMZN+0.86%) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and expectations are high. Analysts predict strong results for the e-commerce giant, driven by growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, contributions from AI, and a “well-managed” holiday season. Bank of America (BAC+1.37%) is forecasting revenue of $187.24 billion, about $1.53 per share, for the fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street’s consensus of $187.31 billion in revenue, approximately $1.47 per share. Analyst Justin Post noted robust fourth-quarter retail data, with Amazon’s core e-commerce business performing well. AWS, in particular, is expected to grow by 19% and 20%, boosted by AI, which the company uses to manage operations, provide entertainment, and assist online shoppers. Looking ahead, Bank of America also predicts that Amazon will provide first-quarter sales guidance between $152.25 billion and $158.25 billion, which is slightly below market expectations of $158.7 billion. Despite this, BofA maintains a buy rating on Amazon’s stock, with a price target of $255, citing the company’s strong profit growth and AI positioning. Amazon shares have increased roughly 5.8% in the previous month, reflecting investing optimism ahead of the earnings report. Beyond earnings, Amazon is navigating other challenges, including looming tariffs on Chinese imports from President Donald Trump. While these tariffs could disrupt e-commerce rivals like Temu and Shein, Amazon is in a strong position. With its established U.S. infrastructure, faster shipping capabilities, and fewer-tariff related hurdles, Amazon is well-positioned to absorb those types of cost increases. To compete with the Chinese fast-fashion giants, Amazon launched ultra-cheap platform Haul in Nov. 2024. Despite struggles in its physical stores, Amazon’s delivery network continues to excel. In 2024, the company set new delivery speed records, with over 9 billion items arriving the same or next day globally. U.S Prime members saved an estimated $95 billion on free shipping last year, with an average customer saving over $500 in delivery fees. As Amazon prepares to report earnings, all eyes will be on how its growth stacks up against Google’s (GOOGL+0.31%), which recently failed to woo Wall Street. As one of the nation’s largest employers, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion, the tech behemoth’s ability to maintain its leadership in cloud services and delivery – and sustain its dominance in e-commerce – remains to be seen.

Title: BlackRock to launch new Bitcoin ETP for European market

The fund would be based on Switzerland, and is unlikely to be an IBIT wrapper. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded product (ETP) linked to Bitcoin (BTC) in Europe, Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 5. According to sources familiar with the matter, the fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland, and BlackRock could begin marketing the product as early as this month. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said BlackRock could potentially launch the new ETP in a similar way it did in Canada. The Canadian ETP is a wrapper for IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) available in the US. However, Seyffart noted that such a move would have a low chance of success in Europe. Seyffart highlighted that BlackRock Bitcoin ETPs in the US and Canada have fees of 25 basis points and 32 basis points (bps), respectively. Notably, European products already offer exposure to BTC through funds carrying a 25 bps fee. Eric Balchunas also showed interest in seeing the fees charged by BlackRock in Europe. He explained that the US is commonly the best in the rest of the world in terms of cost and liquidity. Balchunas added: “Either way shows commitment from world’s biggest asset manager who has big presence overseas.” The European market for crypto ETPs includes more than 160 products that track Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The market’s cumulative value is $17.3 billion. Balchunas highlighted that the European crypto ETF landscape is “barely on [the] leaderboard,” as the US spot Bitcoin ETFs represent 91% of the global share. He assessed that BlackRock had a chance to succeed by bringing the “US Terrordome” to Europe. Yet, Balchunas noted that European investors, unlike US and Asian investors, have less appetite for riskier investment products. According to Farside Investors data, IBIT recorded $40.7 billion in net inflows as of Feb. 4. Its inflows are over three times larger than Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of Feb. 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing U.S.-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the U.S. crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out.

Title: Blackrock Plans to Launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe: Bloomberg

The world's largest asset management firm with more than $10 trillion in AUM, Blackrock (BLK) plans on listing a bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) in Europe, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5%. In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable," said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. "U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas." U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs currently have 91% of the world market, said Balchunas. Blackrock did not comment before press time. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

Meanwhile, first-time and newer advertisers are courting outrageousness and using stunts to try to stand out in the battle to capture the attention of the more than 120 million viewers expected to tune into Sunday’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox.Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they’re as primed to watch the ads as they are the game.“This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. “We may be on different sides, you know, of the gridiron or the field. But we come together.”With 80-plus ad spots divvied up among the 50-something advertisers during the game, it’s tough to make sure viewers remember your brand message. And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher.But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand’s ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer.”In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here’s a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year.CELEBRITY-PALOOZAHellmann’sHellmann’s ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz’s Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann’s.

Cookware brand Hexclad and Doritos ads also feature aliens.SURPRISESNot all advertisers release their ads early, so there are always plenty of surprises on game day. Only two auto brands, Stellantis’ Jeep and Ram, have announced Super Bowl ad plans, but they haven’t given any details on the ads.Dunkin’ has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn’t given any other details.Ad experts think it is unlikely that an A.I.-generated ad will debut during advertising’s biggest night after Coca-Cola’s holiday ad created with the help of A.I. technology drew some backlash. But if one did debut, it would be sure to make a splash. NEW YORK (AP) — Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars.

Totinos Pizza Rolls In one of several ads featuring aliens, comedian Tim Robinson and actor Sam Richardson say goodbye to an alien who was living in their neighborhood. Cookware brand Hexclad and Doritos ads also feature aliens. Not all advertisers release their ads early, so there are always plenty of surprises on game day. Only two auto brands, Stellantis’ Jeep and Ram, have announced Super Bowl ad plans, but they haven’t given any details on the ads. Dunkin’ has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn’t given any other details. Ad experts think it is unlikely that an A.I.-generated ad will debut during advertising’s biggest night after Coca-Cola’s holiday ad created with the help of A.I. technology drew some backlash. But if one did debut, it would be sure to make a splash.

By MAE ANDERSONNEW YORK (AP) — Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars. A tongue dances to Shania Twain to promote Nestle’s Coffee Mate Cold Foam. And Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunite at Katz’s Deli in an ad for Hellmann’s.Related Articles Nation | Trump administration sues Chicago in latest crackdown on ‘sanctuary’ cities Nation | US service member, 3 contractors killed in surveillance mission plane crash in southern Philippines Nation | What to know about what’s tying up a $4B settlement for Hawaii wildfire victims Nation | Average US rate on a 30-year mortgage falls to 6.89%, third straight weekly decline Nation | Utility says its equipment likely started a small blaze that erupted during January’s LA firestorm A frenzied mix of silliness and celebrities is hitting the airwaves and the internet, and that means one thing: it is Super Bowl ad time again.Veteran advertisers are using tried-and-true tactics like celebrity cameos, humor and cute animals to win over watchers. Meanwhile, first-time and newer advertisers are courting outrageousness and using stunts to try to stand out in the battle to capture the attention of the more than 120 million viewers expected to tune into Sunday’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox.Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they’re as primed to watch the ads as they are the game.“This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. “We may be on different sides, you know, of the gridiron or the field. But we come together.”With 80-plus ad spots divvied up among the 50-something advertisers during the game, it’s tough to make sure viewers remember your brand message. And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher.But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand’s ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer.”In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here’s a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year.CELEBRITY-PALOOZAHellmann’sHellmann’s ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz’s Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann’s. Sydney Sweeney joins to utter the famous line “I’ll have what she’s having.”MetaChris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth wear Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses while looking at art. Hemsworth accidently eats a banana in an art piece worth $6.2 million, and Kris Jenner appears to scold them.Michelob UltraActors Catherine O’Hara and Willem Dafoe star as pickleball players hustling younger players to win Michelob Ultras.Stella ArtoisSoccer star David Beckham learns he has a twin named Dave Beckham who turns out to be Matt Damon. They don’t have much in common but both drink Stella Artois.Uber EatsMatthew McConaughey explains a conspiracy theory that football was invented to sell food, with cameos by Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig, Charli XCX, Kevin Bacon and YouTuber Sean Evans.SILLY HUMORCoors LightAdorable sloths undergo mishaps because they’re slow, like a kitchen fire and running into a glass door; they have a “Case of the Mondays,” like many people sluggish at work the day after the Super Bowl.Little CaesarsActor Eugene Levy’s eyebrows fly off and fly around after he tries the pizza chain’s Crazy Puffs in what is strangely not the only ad with flying facial hair in it (see Pringles).Nestle Coffee MateThe first-time advertiser goes for silly humor in an ad that shows a man’s tongue dancing, and even doing a flip, to a song sung by Shania Twain to represent how good Nestle Coffee Mate Cold Foam tastes.PringlesActor Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and L.A. Clippers’ James Harden watch their famous mustaches fly away to help deliver Pringles.SERIOUS MESSAGESDoveDove highlights the problem of low body confidence in young girls and depicts a young girl running down the sidewalk to H.E.R.’s version of “Born to Run.”Foundation to Combat AntisemitismPatriot owner Robert Kraft has an ad in the game for the second year in a row.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 05, 2025 12:32 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: How Trump tariffs could affect weight loss drugs
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-ozempic-wegovy-tariffs-1851755894
Time Published: 2025-02-05T16:53:27Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.96%), the maker of the popular GLP-1 medications Wegovy and Ozempic, said potential tariffs on Europe imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could affect its business. The Guardian reports that Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that the company was “not immune” to potential tariffs. Still, he remains confident that the Danish pharma giant is in a “good position to meet the demands of the new [U.S.] administration.” Last week, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which have since been paused for a month. A separate 10% tariff remains in place for Chinese imports. He also said on Sunday that tariffs on the European Union will “definitely happen.” Trump previously threatened to impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered, if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Jørgensen told Bloomberg on Wednesday that Novo Nordisk has a network of factories around the world, including in the U.S., providing it “a hedge against a world with more tariffs.” The comments come on the same day that the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report. Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Other Big Pharma executives have remained relatively quiet on how tariffs could impact their supply chains. Merck (MRK-0.85%) chief financial officer Caroline Litchfield told investors Tuesday during an earnings call that the company expects “a very immaterial impact” from the tariffs. Litchfield said that the company has a manufacturing footprint that “really enables global supply” with low levels of manufacturing in China, Mexico, and Canada. “We will continue to assess the situation based on the different tariffs that are being proposed by the U.S. government, but remain confident in our supply chain and our ability to supply our medicines and vaccines around the world,” Litchfield told investors. While the proposed tariffs didn’t surface during Pfizer (PFE-1.80%) or Amgen’s (AMGN-2.14%) Tuesday earnings calls, several trade groups have voiced concerns about their potential impact. The Health Distribution Alliance and Association for Accessible Medicines warned in a joint statement that these trade measures could disrupt critical supply chains and patient access to medications, particularly generics. “From the base ingredients to the finished products, U.S. medicines rely on a global supply chain that is already stressed and in need of strengthening,” John Murphy III, President and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, said in a statement. “Tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and China could increase already problematic drug shortages.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AMD stock plunges 10% despite beating sales expectations

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-1.35%) tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday morning, hitting a new 52-week low despite the semiconductor giant exceeding revenue expectations in its latest earnings report. The shares were trading at $108 each in the morning. In its fourth-quarter earnings report released Tuesday, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker posted mixed results. Net income was $482 million, down 28% from $667 million a year earlier. Gaming segment revenue dropped significantly, falling 59% year-over-year to $563 million. But revenue came in at $7.66 billion, exceeding the anticipated $7.53 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, slightly surpassing analysts’ expectations of $1.08. AMD projected total sales of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion for the current quarter, compared to analysts’ average estimate of $7.04 billion. Although AMD lags behind its rival Nvidia (NVDA+2.77%) in selling chips for data centers, its data center unit has become the company’s most crucial business segment. Recent growth has been driven by rising demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence. In the latest quarter, AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, marking a 69% year-over-year increase. “Data Center segment annual revenue nearly doubled as EPYC processor adoption accelerated and we delivered more than $5 billion of AMD Instinct accelerator revenue,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The company, which has been struggling with costs, reduced its global workforce by 4% in November 2024 in an attempt to focus on competing in the AI chip market. In January, AMD introduced new AI PC and gaming processors at the Consumer Electronics Show. The new Ryzen AI Max Series chips are designed for high-performance computing in “thin and light notebooks.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch Bitcoin ETP in Europe as soon as this month after US success

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock is poised to expand its crypto product line with the launch of a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, capitalizing on the runaway success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. Projected to be based in Switzerland, the planned fund would be BlackRock’s first crypto ETP in the European market. The world’s leading asset manager, which previously focused on North America, launched the IBIT fund and subsequently introduced its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The new ETP may debut as soon as this month, sources said. BlackRock’s IBIT has become one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs since its launch last January, accumulating approximately $58 billion worth of Bitcoin as of February 4. The fund ranks as the 31st largest ETF globally across all categories, including traditional finance products, according to VettaFi. IBIT has led the spot Bitcoin ETF market with a five-day winning streak, attracting nearly $934 million in net inflows since January 30. Yesterday’s inflows alone totaled approximately $249 million, driving most of the spot Bitcoin ETF market’s gains, according to data from Farside Investors. The European crypto ETP market currently features more than 160 products tracking various digital assets, though its size remains smaller than the US market. The expansion comes as Bitcoin has reached new highs this year, amid increased regulatory clarity following the EU’s implementation of new crypto rules. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially speculated that BlackRock might consider replicating its Canadian Bitcoin ETF structure in Europe using a “wrapper” approach, where the ETF holds shares of its US-listed IBIT. However, he swiftly confirmed that this strategy is unlikely to be allowed under EU regulations. Sources told him that EU regulators are poised to reject such a workaround, likely requiring BlackRock to launch a standalone European Bitcoin ETF. This necessitates a different approach and puts the spotlight squarely on fees. “I have been informed that this is unlikely to be allowed in EU. So will be interesting to see what they charge assuming they launch a standalone product. In the US the total cost is 25 bps. Canada is 32 bps,” he wrote on X. “There’s already products at 25 bps and lower in Europe including Valour who has a zero expense ratio product.” Beyond regulatory hurdles and pricing pressures, BlackRock faces a more fundamental challenge: market size and investor appetite, Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared in a comment. The US spot Bitcoin ETF market, despite being just a year old, has exploded in popularity, capturing a staggering 91% of global market share. Europe, by contrast, lags considerably. While European investors are sophisticated, they have historically shown less enthusiasm for the high-octane investment products that have resonated with US investors.

Title: Buy This Cheap 6% Dividend As The S&P 500 Overheats
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/05/buy-this-cheap-6-dividend-as-the-sp-500-overheats/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
We are—unequivocally—bullish on the U.S. economy. We’re also big fans of the 6.1% dividend we’re going to discuss below, which trades for less than half its annual sales. That’s pretty much the opposite of the nosebleed 26 times sales (and 0.03% yield—not a typo) over at Nvidia (NVDA), even after last week’s panic over Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek. Fact is, it’s easy to be bullish on the U.S. these days, with the country’s economy leading (and in many cases lapping) those of other countries. The IMF, for example, sees the U.S. economy growing 2.7% in 2025, tops in the G7 and nearly triple the forecast 1% growth in the Eurozone. What’s more, the U.S. accounted for 26% of global GDP in 2024, according to Visual Capitalist. That’s despite the fact that we only account for a little over 4% of the world’s population. The productivity, dynamism and sheer power of the U.S. economy are marvels — and something we should all be proud of. But here’s the thing: The S&P 500’s valuation is overstretched (to say the least). The 2023 and 2024 bull runs have left the S&P 500 trading at a nosebleed 26 times earnings as I write this. The NASDAQ? A ridiculous 33 times. With numbers like that, you could be looking at a “lost decade” if you’re sitting in an index fund like the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Population growth won’t save us, either. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our numbers will grow just 0.6% a year on average from 2024 to 2034. Look out further and that figure drops sharply, to a mere 0.2% annually from 2045 to 2054. And we have tighter immigration policies coming. Not to mention tariffs, which threaten to slow economic growth and throttle up inflation. The point I’m making is that when it comes to stocks, those who sit in an index fund are in for a shock. The winners in the next decade will be those who make timely moves into (and out of) individual stocks. And if you focus on top-quality dividend stocks, you give yourself two extra advantages: Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a big believer in America. But we contrarian income investors always follow the data, and what it’s telling us is clear: Now is the time to diversify a little beyond America’s borders. It’s just the safe thing to do. Plus there are simply more global stocks in the bargain bin after this massive US-market run-up, like the 6.1%-yielder (with a growing payout) we’ll get into momentarily. Here’s another edge we have as U.S. investors: Because the U.S. market is so dynamic, everyone wants to list here. Which means we can buy big international dividend payers on the NYSE. Which brings me to the stock we’re going to delve into today: BP plc (BP), the British energy giant, a holding of my Contrarian Income Report advisory. BP yields 6.1%, trades on the NYSE and even pays dividends in U.S. funds. It’s the same as buying a U.S.-based producer like Exxon Mobil (XOM) but you’re getting a much higher dividend — XOM yields just 3.7%. Back to BP, whose mix we like better than that of XOM today, with its strong base in the US, through its presence in important shale areas, like the Permian and Eagle Ford. That’s complemented by offshore oil fields in places like its Clair oilfield, offshore Scotland and natural gas production facilities, like its LNG operation in Indonesia. BP has been around forever (more than a century), and like the old British Empire, the sun never sets on its 61-country operation. It was the first company to pull oil out of the ground in the Middle East (in 1908) and opened the first refinery in the region (in 1912). BP also deals in wind power, hydrogen and carbon capture; owns thousands of miles of pipelines; has commercial operations, such as convenience and retail fuel stations, Castrol lubricants and EV charging; trades oil, gas, and renewable and non-renewable power; and even has a bioenergy business. In other words, management has smartly positioned BP as a leader in the energy transition and in the fossil fuels that will still play an important role in the global economy for years to come. Which brings us back to that 6.1% dividend. The company cut its payout by 50% in 2020 and shares were chopped in half, as well. That’s the result of the “Dividend Magnet,” which long-time readers will recognize as the tendency for share prices to track dividend hikes (and cuts). Since then, though, the giant has recovered. Sales doubled between 2020 and 2023, and the firm is solidly profitable again. The “payout penance” continues for BP, with four hikes in the books since its infamous cut. This reminds us that CFOs are like carpenters — they measure twice and cut the dividend just once if they can help it. So far, so good. BP’s dividend sits 50% higher than after the cut. That’s still off its peak but trending positively. BP Dividend Magnet Ycharts The fact that the British oil giant pays out just 36% of its last 12 months of free cash flow (FCF)—well below my 50% “safety limit”—is another indication that management got it right here. Even so, income scars (and memories of them) are slow to heal. BP trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings and 0.45-times trailing sales today. Contrast that with Exxon, which trades for 1.4-times sales and 14-times forward earnings. This sad pup will soon be readopted by income-hungry investors, especially if 10-year Treasury rates continue to keep bouncing off their “5% ceiling,” as I expect. That suggests long rates are high enough to keep inflation trending down—putting lower rates on the table in the future. All of this leaves us in a pretty sweet spot with BP: collecting a growing dividend set to pull the price higher, along with a 6.1% yield. And thanks to the stock’s bargain valuation, we’re getting some nice downside insulation here (always appreciated in the volatile oil business) and a shot at strong upside, too. And it’s all underpinned by the British giant’s exposure to the still-growing U.S. economy and the undervalued global one, too. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Ondo GM will provide exposure to Apple, Tesla, SPDR, and more with stablecoin transactions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance has introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform designed to bring real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto the blockchain. According to a Feb. 4 statement, this move provides global access to US securities by enabling investors outside the US to gain exposure through tokenized representations of these assets. It stated: “With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities—AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.—with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.” The company said that the token issued through Ondo GM maintains a 1:1 backing with its underlying security, ensuring legitimacy and transparency. It noted that these tokens function similarly to stablecoins, facilitating seamless transfers across blockchain networks beyond US borders. Ondo furthered that investors benefit from instant minting and redemption, enhanced liquidity, and built-in access to on-chain financial services, including lending, trading, and yield-generation opportunities. Ondo added: “Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.” To support broader adoption, Ondo GM provides comprehensive APIs that enable brokers, asset issuers, and fintech platforms to integrate tokenized assets into their systems. Additionally, a legal framework ensures investor protection, safeguarding assets with a structured approach that minimizes risk. Ondo’s move comes as the RWA sector has experienced remarkable growth, reaching an all-time high of $16.88 billion in on-chain value. Data from RWA.xyz reveals a 94% increase over the past year, with nearly $4 billion added in the last three months alone. There are now 83,049 entities holding RWAs, collectively managing assets issued by 112 providers. Private credit leads the market with $11.6 billion in tokenized value, followed by US Treasury debt ($3.5 billion) and commodities ($1.1 billion). Institutional funds represent a smaller portion, valued at around $410 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for RWAs, hosting 67 asset tokens, while zkSync (28) and Arbitrum (20) follow closely. The surge in RWA adoption aligns with growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have deepened their involvement in tokenized finance, signaling a shift toward blockchain-powered investment solutions.

Marc Chaikin is a legendary figure on Wall Street, renowned for spotting market trends before they unfold. His insights have accurately predicted major downturns, including the 2012 Priceline collapse, the COVID-19 market crash, and the recent banking crisis. When Chaikin speaks, Wall Street pays attention. This time, he’s sounding the alarm on the AI frenzy sweeping the U.S. stock market. According to Chaikin, investors holding the wrong AI stocks risk devastating financial losses. He stated, “If you’re holding Nvidia (NVDA) or FAANG right now, it’s time to prepare for a massive shift.” However, Chaikin believes there’s still a lot of money to be made in AI stocks, but only the right ones. Unlike before, picking a random trending stock won’t make you a millionaire. The markets are tough, and only accurate stock picking is the key to success. The demand for AI tech and products is growing by the minute. Companies like Palantir Technologies have benefited hugely from this. The stock is up by more than 60% since mid-January. This comes after a huge 340% increase in stock prices in 2024. This surge in prices is backed by a strong 36% year-on-year revenue growth, which now stands at $828M. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, credits the ‘untamed’ growth of demand in its AI software for the surge. The company now expects to increase revenue by another 54% in 2025. As you can see, picking the right AI stocks is the need of the hour. However, doing so can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Even then, the probability of the stock making you money is less, given the choppy waters in which AI stocks find themselves. This is where AI agents like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) come in. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an autonomous AI agent that cuts through the information overload floating around about the crypto market and produces actionable insights through hive-mind analysis. What this means is that $MIND can interact with influencers and shape conversations and discussions on platforms like X. In the process, it forms a view of its own to produce triggers for all token holders. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this self-evolving AI agent helps investors identify early opportunities in the market by processing information in real time. The problem with crypto investing is that there’s too much information, all of which may or may not be factual. By the time a human can process this information barrage, the opportunity is long gone. $MIND, on the other hand, uses only real-time information (as fresh as a few seconds ago) to form a view of the markets. This adds to your trading efficiency by cutting down on data deviations. MIND of Pepe not only looks to take forward the legendary frog meme legacy but also adds real-time utility for all crypto investors. What would investors love more than regular early-opportunity investment ideas in a dicey AI stock market? Plus, $MIND developers have laid out a long-term vision for the project. Out of a total supply of 100B $MIND tokens, 30% has been reserved for innovation and AI agent updates, while 25% has been kept to support the AI agent ecosystem growth. Early $MIND investors can also earn 443% APY staking rewards – 15% of the token supply has been kept for staking and community incentives. No wonder experts believe $MIND can help investors make crazy gains in this bull run. The $MIND presale is currently live, with the project having already raised $5.1M so far. It’s, in fact, one of the best crypto presales going around right now. Available at a price of just $0.0032662 per token, the next price increase will happen in less than 2 days. This means this is the perfect time to buy the best AI agent coin. Simply visit the official $MIND presale page and connect your wallet. You can buy it with ETH, BNB, or USDT or use your card directly to complete the payment. However, it’s important to remember that crypto markets are subject to volatility and news-based risks. That’s why it is important to do your own research before making any purchases.

Title: Super Bowl ads offer laughs, celebs and surprises to win over viewers

Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars NEW YORK -- Eugene Levy's trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars. A tongue dances to Shania Twain to promote Nestle's Coffee Mate Cold Foam. And Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunite at Katz's Deli in an ad for Hellmann's. A frenzied mix of silliness and celebrities is hitting the airwaves and the internet, and that means one thing: it is Super Bowl ad time again. Veteran advertisers are using tried-and-true tactics like celebrity cameos, humor and cute animals to win over watchers. Meanwhile, first-time and newer advertisers are courting outrageousness and using stunts to try to stand out in the battle to capture the attention of the more than 120 million viewers expected to tune into Sunday's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox. Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they're as primed to watch the ads as they are the game. "This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. “We may be on different sides, you know, of the gridiron or the field. But we come together.” With 80-plus ad spots divvied up among the 50-something advertisers during the game, it’s tough to make sure viewers remember your brand message. And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher. But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand's ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer." In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here's a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year. Hellmann's Hellmann's ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz's Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann's. Sydney Sweeney joins to utter the famous line “I'll have what she's having.” Meta Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth wear Ray-Ban Meta AI-powered glasses while looking at art. Hemsworth accidently eats a banana in an art piece worth $6.2 million, and Kris Jenner appears to scold them. Michelob Ultra Actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe star as pickleball players hustling younger players to win Michelob Ultras. Stella Artois Soccer star David Beckham learns he has a twin named Dave Beckham who turns out to be Matt Damon. They don't have much in common but both drink Stella Artois. Uber Eats Matthew McConaughey explains a conspiracy theory that football was invented to sell food, with cameos by Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig, Charli XCX, Kevin Bacon and YouTuber Sean Evans. Coors Light Adorable sloths undergo mishaps because they're slow, like a kitchen fire and running into a glass door; they have a “Case of the Mondays,” like many people sluggish at work the day after the Super Bowl. Little Caesars Actor Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and fly around after he tries the pizza chain's Crazy Puffs in what is strangely not the only ad with flying facial hair in it (see Pringles). Nestle Coffee Mate The first-time advertiser goes for silly humor in an ad that shows a man’s tongue dancing, and even doing a flip, to a song sung by Shania Twain to represent how good Nestle Coffee Mate Cold Foam tastes. Pringles Actor Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and L.A. Clippers’ James Harden watch their famous mustaches fly away to help deliver Pringles. Dove Dove highlights the problem of low body confidence in young girls and depicts a young girl running down the sidewalk to H.E.R.’s version of “Born to Run.” Foundation to Combat Antisemitism Patriot owner Robert Kraft has an ad in the game for the second year in a row. Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady voice reasons why people hate each other in an effort to combat hate speech. Hims and Hers First-time advertiser Telehealth company Hims & Hers highlights the obesity epidemic and says weight loss drugs should be more affordable. Novartis First-time advertiser Novartis is focusing on breast cancer awareness in its ad featuring Wanda Sykes and Hailee Steinfeld. Häagen-Dazs The ice-cream brand reunites “Fast & Furious” stars Michelle Rodriguez, Vin Diesel and Ludacris, except this time, they're going slow. They cruise down the Pacific Coast Highway in a Chevrolet Chevelle slowly so they can enjoy eating an ice cream bar. Instacart First-timer Instacart joins DoorDash and Uber Eats and a battle between food delivery services during the game. Instacart loads up its ad with tons of brand characters it hopes viewers recognize: from Mountain Dew’s “PuppyMonkeyBaby” character from a 2016 Super Bowl ad to the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The characters represent all the things you can get delivered from the food delivery service. Totinos Pizza Rolls In one of several ads featuring aliens, comedian Tim Robinson and actor Sam Richardson say goodbye to an alien who was living in their neighborhood. Cookware brand Hexclad and Doritos ads also feature aliens. Not all advertisers release their ads early, so there are always plenty of surprises on game day. Only two auto brands, Stellantis' Jeep and Ram, have announced Super Bowl ad plans, but they haven't given any details on the ads. Dunkin' has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn't given any other details. Ad experts think it is unlikely that an A.I.-generated ad will debut during advertising's biggest night after Coca-Cola's holiday ad created with the help of A.I. technology drew some backlash. But if one did debut, it would be sure to make a splash. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Google Leads Tech Stock Slump As Earnings, Trump Tariffs Fallout Weighs On Market

A slew of major American technology stocks pulled back Wednesday, as the latest batch of fourth-quarter earnings and an increasingly complicated operating environment for multinational companies ate at Wall Street’s risk appetite. An ever-shifting geopolitical backdrop has weighed on the minds of investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipped 0.7% shortly after market open. Leading the losses was an 8% drop for Google parent Alphabet, a slide which erased as much as $211 billion in market value after the company’s earnings report revealed weaker Q4 revenues than consensus analyst forecasts and far higher 2025 spending guidance than anticipated, as Alphabet stock paces toward its biggest percentage loss since October 2023. Also struggling after their company’s earnings reports were shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices and ride-hailer Uber. AMD stock tanked 10% to their cheapest level since 2023 after the firm fell short of estimates in its artificial intelligence-focused datacenter division, while Uber stock fell 7% after the company predicted lower-than-expected ride revenue during 2025’s first three months. Notable fallers not tied to quarterly results included iPhone maker Apple, and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle producer Tesla, both of which suffered about 2% share price declines. Apple’s drop followed a Bloomberg report Chinese regulators are considering an antitrust investigation into Apple over its App Store fees, a possible retaliation to President Donald Trump’s 10% additional tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. Tesla’s dip came after the company reportedly suffered its worst month for new car sales in Germany since 2021 and France since 2022, a potential consequence of Musk’s outspoken support for right-wing politicians including Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland party. The Nasdaq is still up 1% in 2025, but it’s been a rocky path to those gains, as tariffs and the heated U.S.-China generative AI competition weighed on investors’ minds. Also down Wednesday were New York-listed shares of Chinese companies. Online retailers Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo, the two most valuable U.S.-traded Chinese firms, both suffered about 2% drops as investors reacted to an increasingly messy trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which most recently resulted in the U.S. Postal Service briefly pausing acceptance of all packages from China and Hong Kong.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top AI stocks trending on Wall Street. The tech world may be steering in a new direction with the emergence of DeepSeek and the cheaper and more efficient models it promises. In the latest news, bulls from Europe have deemed that the sector may have further to run, despite the emergence of these Chinese copies. This news emerged after January 27, when the tech world witnessed a broad market sell-off driven by DeepSeek’s advancements, investors’ concerns regarding West’s huge investments in chipmakers and data centers, valuation risks, and increasing competition from alternative AI models. In short, DeepSeek sparked a rout in the tech world. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks on Analysts’ Radar Right Now With the emergence of these models, companies are readjusting their approaches, focusing more on efficiency rather than demand. Even big AI names such as OpenAI have been prompted to rethink their strategies. The AI startup is reportedly thinking of “figuring out a different open-source strategy” after DeepSeek released a lower-cost open-source AI model, Seeking Alpha reported Saturday. Moreover, OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil recently unveiled that the company was considering open-sourcing older AI models. This reflects a broader industry shift toward efficiency and accessibility. Nevertheless, since the sell-off, tech stocks have thankfully rebounded. European markets in particular are hitting new highs, Reuters reports. One economic theory, known as the “Jevons Paradox” seems to be the answer. According to the paradox, when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand may increase rather than the other way around. This is because the price of using the resource drops. “I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere. This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment,” said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Bloomua / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On February 4, Meta was revisited by a Wall Street analyst, Sachin Mittal from DBS, who maintained his Buy rating on the stock with a $750 price target. Mittal’s buy rating stems from Meta (NASDAQ:META)’s strong financial performance and strategic initiatives. The company surpassed market expectations in terms of earnings and revenue growth, driven by reduced legal losses and strong performance from its Reels initiative. Reels are a form of short, vertical video format advertising that has achieved growth in monetization and user engagement. They leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to boost content recommendation abilities and targeting capabilities. Besides the robust performance from Reels, the company’s investment in AI technologies, particularly the Llama large-language model, has also demonstrated growth and is anticipated to drive further user engagement and advertising efficiency. Further justifying the buy rating is Meta’s focus on Metaverse and a favorable profit outlook. Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks trending on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: The Ozempic boom is slowing down
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-ozempic-wegovy-sales-1851755300
Time Published: 2025-02-05T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.96%) blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy doubled in the fourth quarter, but the Danish pharmaceutical giant warns that sales growth for all its drugs — including Ozempic — is expected to slow in the coming year. Wegovy sales skyrocketed 107% to 19.8 billion Danish Krone ($2.8 billion) in the fourth-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.4 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug just beat analysts’ expectations of $2.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.20%). Sales of Ozempic during the quarter rose 7% to $4.7 billion. “We are pleased with the performance in 2024, where 26% sales growth reflects that more than 45 million people are now benefiting from our treatments,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in the company’s fourth quarter earnings report. Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slowdown to between 16% and 24%. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Overall, the company’s profit rose 23% in the three months ending Dec. 31, reaching $3.9 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the same period the previous year. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 24% year over year to $11.9 billion, from $9.5 billion and surpassing analyst projections of $11 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.88, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $0.83, according to FactSet. Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+3.71%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Despite strong demand, Novo Nordisk’s stock has fallen 27% over the past year. A recent dip followed the underwhelming results of CagriSema, its experimental weight-loss and diabetes drug. The medication failed to meet expectations of 25% average weight loss, with patients in a phase 3 clinical trial losing an average of 22.7% of body weight over 68 weeks. Still, the company’s stock rose nearly 3% during pre-market trading on Wednesday following the earnings release.

Title: Will DeepSeek Upend US Tech Dominance?
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/deepseek-represents-a-challenge-to-us-tech-oligopolies-by-angela-huyue-zhang-2025-02
Time Published: 2025-02-05T13:39:20Z
Full Content:
US restrictions on high-tech exports to China were designed to hamper the country's progress in cutting-edge sectors, such as artificial intelligence. But, as DeepSeek has shown, the restrictions have had the opposite effect, spurring precisely the kinds of innovations that will enable Chinese firms to challenge US tech oligopolies. LONDON – In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite into orbit, sparking fears in the United States that, unless it took radical action to accelerate innovation, its Cold War adversary would leave it in the technological dust. Now, the Chinese startup DeepSeek has built an artificial intelligence model that it claims can outperform industry-leading American competitors, at a fraction of the cost, leading some commentators to proclaim that another “Sputnik moment” has arrived. But the focus on the US-China geopolitical rivalry misses the point. Rather than viewing DeepSeek as a stand-in for China, and established industry leaders (such as OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic) as representatives of the US, we should see this as a case of an ingenious startup emerging to challenge oligopolistic incumbents – a dynamic that is typically welcomed in open markets. DeepSeek has proved that software ingenuity can compensate, at least partly, for hardware deficiencies. Its achievement raises an uncomfortable question: Why haven’t leading US industry leaders achieved similar breakthroughs? Nobel laureate economist Daron Acemoglu points the finger at groupthink, which he says prevented Silicon Valley incumbents from adequately considering alternative approaches. He might have a point, but it is only half the story. DeepSeek’s success didn’t happen overnight. In May 2024, the firm launched its V2 model, which boasted an exceptional cost-to-performance ratio and sparked a fierce price war among Chinese AI providers. Moreover, over the last year or so, Chinese firms – both giants (including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance) and startups (like Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, Baichuan AI, MiniMax, and 01.AI) – have all developed cutting-edge AI models with remarkable cost efficiency. Even within the US, researchers have long explored ways to improve the efficiency – and thus lower the costs – of AI training. For example, in 2022, former Meta researcher Tim Dettmers, now at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and his co-authors published research on optimizing AI models to run on less computing power. DeepSeek cited their research in the technical paper it released along with its V3 model. Put simply, it would have been impossible for any AI firm – especially an industry leader – not to realize that lower-cost models were feasible. But American AI developers showed much less interest than their Chinese counterparts in pursuing this line of innovation. This was not a matter only of insularity or hubris; it appears to be a deliberate business choice. Don’t miss our next event, taking place at the AI Action Summit in Paris. Register now, and watch live on February 10 as leading thinkers consider what effective AI governance demands. Register Now AI development has so far been defined by the “scaling law,” which predicts that more computing power leads to more powerful models. This has fueled demand for high-performance semiconductor chips, with more than 80% of the funds raised by many AI companies going toward computing resources. That is why the biggest winner has been the advanced chipmaker Nvidia, which claimed 90% of the market for AI graphics processing units by the end of last year. Thanks to this virtual monopoly in the hardware layer, Nvidia could control the foundations of generative AI. The cloud-computing sector, which provides the on-demand computing power AI models require, is similarly concentrated, with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dominating the market. But these upstream players aren’t just passive suppliers. They have strategically positioned themselves across the AI value chain by acquiring, investing in, or forming alliances with leading AI model developers. Nvidia has invested in OpenAI, Mistral, Perplexity, and others. Google not only develops its own AI models, but also holds a stake in Anthropic, OpenAI’s main competitor. And Microsoft, an early OpenAI investor, recently backed Inflection AI in the US and expanded overseas, with investments in France’s Mistral and the United Arab Emirates’ G42. Taking this approach has ensured that the entire AI industry depends on a few giant firms and entrenched a dynamic whereby rising demand for computing power across the sector increases these firms’ profits. As dominant players, they had less incentive to improve cost efficiency downstream, which could cut into their upstream profits. Chinese AI firms have been operating within an entirely different reality, as US-led trade restrictions have prevented them from purchasing the most advanced chips. The goal of US export controls has always been to cripple China’s AI sector. But, as DeepSeek has shown, they have had the opposite effect, spurring precisely the innovations that will enable Chinese firms to challenge American AI oligopolies. Already, DeepSeek’s rise triggered a stock-market selloff of AI-related US companies, not least Nvidia. This is surely unwelcome news for US President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump has made no secret of his determination to contain China, including by fulfilling his promise to impose a 10% across-the-board import tariff on Chinese goods. And he has heavily courted Silicon Valley bosses – once aligned with the Democratic Party – who have eagerly embraced the prospect of lax regulation. But that does not mean that DeepSeek’s rise is bad news for the US or the AI industry more broadly. Over the past five years, calls to rein in America’s tech giants have been growing louder. Despite the best efforts of former President Joe Biden’s administration, however, the US Congress has failed to introduce any meaningful legislation on this front. Ironically, thanks to US policies designed to constrain China’s AI ambitions, the US AI sector seems set to get some of the market competition that it so badly needs. Geopolitics might have contributed to DeepSeek’s rise. But the firm’s disruption of the AI industry is about market – not great-power – competition.

Title: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge 175% Year-Over-Year

U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a 175% year-over-year increase in almost the first three weeks of trading. In 2025, from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading. James Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment. Previously, James worked as a Research Analyst at Saidler & Co., a Swiss hedge fund, where he developed expertise in on-chain analytics. His work focuses on monitoring flows to analyze Bitcoin's role within the broader financial system.

Title: The Smartest Investment: How ‘Quality Jobs’ Drive Profits
URL: https://observer.com/2025/02/why-quality-jobs-drive-profits-and-boost-the-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T12:00:35Z
Full Content:
The American workplace is in crisis. In 2024, Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace Report quantified what everyone already knew: 33 percent of U.S. workers are “engaged,” 51 percent are “not engaged,” and 16 percent are “actively disengaged.” Looking only at those numbers, you’d be forgiven for wondering whether there was some sort of collective, corporate effort to make Americans hate what they do for a living. As Charlie Munger famously said, “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Across centuries, political divides and academic disciplines, one idea remains clear: quality jobs are the foundation of thriving markets, strong economies and healthy societies. Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, emphasized in The Theory of Moral Sentiments that markets require moral foundations. More recently, MIT professor Zeynep Ton reinforced this principle, showing that companies with strong job quality strategies see 30-40 percent lower turnover, 20-30 percent higher productivity and 15 to 25 percent higher customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, in What Happened to Capitalism?, Oren Cass points to a stark reality: over the past 50 years, corporate profits have soared 185 percent, while wages have grown just 1 percent. A “quality job” encompasses several key attributes that collectively enhance the well-being and satisfaction of employees. These positions offer fair compensation, ensuring that workers receive wages commensurate with their skills and experience. Beyond monetary rewards, quality jobs provide comprehensive benefits packages, including health insurance and retirement plans, which contribute to long-term financial security. Such roles also offer opportunities for professional growth through training and development programs, enabling employees to advance their careers. Moreover, quality jobs foster a positive work environment characterized by respect, inclusivity and a healthy work-life balance, ensuring employees feel valued and supported. Collectively, these elements improve individual job satisfaction and enhance overall productivity and organizational commitment. The increasingly stark contrast between profits and wages has led to growing calls for change. In 2019, the Business Roundtable made history when 181 CEOs renounced shareholder primacy and embraced stakeholder capitalism. They committed to investing in employees through fair compensation, benefits, training and workplace dignity. Johnson & Johnson pioneered this stakeholder approach with their 1943 credo, explicitly recognizing responsibilities to employees before shareholders as a precondition to generating sustainable profits. For many, the results speak for themselves: Costco (COST) pays its workers an average of $25 per hour with 13 percent turnover versus the industry’s 60 percent. Southwest Airlines introduced its profit-sharing program in 1974 and boasts a 4 percent employee turnover rate. Nucor Steel maintains a no-layoffs policy through downturns and shares profits directly with workers; in 2023, this translated to almost $1 billion in profit sharing for the company’s nearly 31,000 employees. Others offer cautionary tales. In 2019, McDonald’s announced it would no longer lobby against raising workers’ pay, indicating previous resistance to wage increases. Despite this shift, the company has faced challenges in attracting workers, leading to wage increases in 2021 to address a “challenging hiring environment.” And though Amazon promised better worker treatment, union battles, high injury rates and reports of worker surveillance were just a few of the headlines that made issues for Jeff Bezos last year. Of course, Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald’s remain highly successful, profitable and growing companies. But imagine how much more impactful they could be—both economically and reputationally—if they fully embraced the commitments they made in 2019. Their influence is undeniable; the question is whether they’ll use it to set a new standard or simply maintain the status quo. Investing in quality jobs isn’t just an honorable choice—it’s a financial one. Higher wages, predictable schedules and training programs reduce turnover, cut recruitment costs and boost output. Southwest Airlines, Nucor and Costco aren’t simply doing the right thing; they’re outcompeting their peers because of it. I coined the term “Patriotic Capitalism” to refer to the notion of an economic and investment framework that prioritizes country, democracy and the common good as the way forward for national prosperity. This framework aligns with the vision of an economy where people can contribute productively to their communities, support their families and raise children prepared to do the same. Beyond ethics, it’s essential for national competitiveness in a world where human capital determines success. In addition to policy changes, attitude shifts across C-suites and boards are necessary. Superior operational design and a focus on human capital investment can generate enhanced and sustainable financial returns. Research conducted by a global private equity firm found that companies whose senior management had the highest levels of empathy generated the highest financial returns. Authentic empathy engages workers; engaged workers drive innovation, productivity and profitability. Quality jobs go beyond fair pay—they lay the foundation for innovation and productive investment. The framework is straightforward, comprising common-sense elements like broad-based employee ownership, fair compensation, predictable schedules and meaningful training. The evidence is clear: quality jobs strengthen companies, build resilient communities and enhance national competitiveness. Businesses that embrace this approach aren’t just doing good; they’re gaining a sustainable competitive edge. The choice isn’t between profitability and good jobs—that’s a false dichotomy that both Adam Smith and modern research debunk. Yes, raising wages and offering ownership requires an upfront investment—but high turnover, low morale and worker disengagement already cost U.S. businesses billions annually. Paying employees better isn’t charity; it’s a calculated business strategy that leads to higher productivity, stronger brand loyalty, and better long-term returns. Quality jobs are the smartest investment a company can make in its future. And in today’s global economy, they might be the smartest investment America can make in its future, too.

Sheaffer Told Me To fashion influencer blog February 5, 2025 By Sheaffer 2 Comments This post is sponsored by Nordstrom and Collective Voice. The product selections are my own, and I only highlight and promote items that I truly love. Thank you for supporting the brands that support Sheaffer Told Me To! ***************** It’s February, which means before we know it, we will be transitioning to spring. Heck, if you live where I live, we basically transitioned to summer this past Monday because we got up to almost 80 degrees. But no worries, today is in the 50s and we’ll be back to winter and temps in the 20s by next weekend, which means I’m already in transitional dressing mode. Haha! I hear from y’all all the time that transitional dressing often stumps people, but I always follow some simple tips and tricks that help me easily transition between seasons. We’ll be talking about them over the next several weeks, but today we’re focusing on pants that really lend themselves to transitional dressing. Tell me this isn’t a perfect outfit to help you transition to warmer temps. (FYI, I was actually hot in this outfit when we were taking pics on Monday.) white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers One of my main tips to transition to another season is a no brainer: to dress in layers. Every single outfit in today’s post starts with this classic white tee that is the perfect base layer. If you’ve been with me for a while, you know I used to wear the “whisper thin” Madewell v-neck tee all the time. It was a good tee at a good price point, but it wasn’t the best quality because it was pretty thin. This white tee is my new favorite white tee. It’s made of a 100% cotton jersey, the fit is perfect, and it’s not see-through at all. Heads up that is does run small. I’m in a medium, and the fit is actually great for a base layering piece, but I would probably want it a bit looser if I was wearing it on its own. And speaking of layers, a great denim jacket is THE #1 CLOSET STAPLE that I feel every single person needs in their closet. I think Kut from the Kloth makes the greatest denim jackets, and you can click HERE to find the one with the wash and fit that you prefer. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers sunglasses / earrings / heart charm necklace heart charm necklace layered coil bracelet / textured bangle I found these ecru jeans last year, but they sold out immediately. They restocked, and then they sold out again. BUT RIGHT NOW THEY APPEAR TO BE FULLY STOCKED and they are a perfect transitional pair of pants. This particular pair is a perfectly neutral “ecru”, but they come in 3 other color options as well. They are ankle cropped flares with a frayed hem, and I love them so much. They do have the Ab Solution power mesh panels that we all appreciate, and they enable the jeans to be super flattering and super comfy at the same time. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Y’all. These sneakers. Talk about a breath of fresh air! I’m wearing the “Clear Pink/ Solar Orange/ Gum”, but there’s actually 14 fantastic color combos to choose from! They are incredibly comfy, but I definitely recommend sizing down at least 1/2 a size. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Dang they’re cute. Adidas sneakers Adidas sneakers Here I’ve switched up the top layer from a denim jacket to a cardigan. And I switched out sneakers for mules. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules This striped cardigan comes in 3 colors and got marked down just yesterday! It’s 100% cotton and a heavier weight than most of the other cardigans in my closet. I’m often drawn to olive green, and y’all know I loved the stripes. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. The cross body is a new favorite find. It’s on the expensive side, but it’s definitely a quality handbag and I think many of y’all are going to think that it is well worth it. The neutral basket weave pattern will go with pretty much any outfit you can dream up, and it comes with a removable shoulder strap as well as a removable cross body strap. There are two interior pockets that make it easy to store your phone or keys…AND GET THIS… you can throw the bag in the wash. No kidding. I’m carrying the “knot brown”, but there’s also a darker option called “Hazelnut”. You can check out all of the bag options from Rothy’s HERE. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules And these earrings? Come on! They’re darling. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / striped cardigan / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag These Rothy’s mules are something special. I really wanted this neutral pair, but they also come in black and an animal print. If I’m being honest, I wish owning all 3 pair made sense because I know I would wear the heck out of all of them. True to size, super super comfy, and they don’t flop when you walk! ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules They are beautifully made, and I absolutely love the design detail. ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Before we talk about these pants, I’m sad to report that y’all sold them out on Monday. 🙁 I’d already shot these pics and had the idea for the post, so I’m still highlighting the pants…. but I’m doing so with the knowledge that my contact says they are slated to come back in stock at some point, they just don’t know when. When they do come back, GRAB THEM. You pull these babies on like you would a pair of your favorite leggings. But I’m telling you, they’re more comfortable than leggings, because they don’t have the compression that most leggings have. The waistband is wide, it lays nicely, and it is of course uber comfy. And get excited, because as you can see, there are functional pockets. When compared to the other black Wit and Wisdom pants I’ve highlighted in the past, these are a lighter weight than all of them. They have a slimmer leg than the drawstring pants, but the leg is a bit fuller and longer than the more classic trousers I’ve highlighted. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers I think this is the way I’ll wear them the most. With a casual tee and a denim jacket. This is an outfit formula that ALWAYS works. This look would also be great with a leopard tote and neutral mules…. or a black bag and white sneakers… the possibilities are endless. If you love the look and want to recreate it, you can click HERE for a similar pair of pants that I also own and love. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers And surprise surprise… a great white tee and a great denim jacket completing another outfit. 😉 white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers sunglasses / earrings / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace How fun is this necklace combo? This puffy heart is VERY oversized, and I love it. My exact beaded necklace is low in stock, but you can click HERE for a similar option from the same maker if the exact one is no longer available. white tee / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace These pants are so SO good. Truly, these pants are what black pant dreams are made of. They are a wider leg (but not too wide), which makes them modern but still flattering and not overwhelming. I’m 5’4″ with long legs for my height, and although I think a non-heeled shoe is probably the best choice for these on me, you can click HERE to see Monday’s post where I do have a pic of me wearing them with low black pumps. Again, you can click HERE for a similar pair. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers Here’s a good up-close look at the pants. layered coil bracelet / textured bangle / white tee / denim jacket options / black pants I’m so pumped that I grabbed these leopard sneakers, and I’m so excited to add some sass and comfort to lots of different outfits. They are the perfect pop of leopard to add if you ask me! True to size and quite comfy. Like really REALLY comfy. black pants / leopard sneakers I’m in love with this entire outfit. white tee / denim jacket options / earrings / leopard sneakers Here I’ve got the same pair of pants, but I’ve again switched out the denim jacket for a cardi and the sneakers for mules. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules This cardigan is another NEW MARKDOWN (as of just yesterday). I feel like it’s a totally classic piece that would serve anybody well. Pair it with black pants for the office, or pair it with jeans and sneakers for a great casual (but totally put together) outfit. This one has a really pretty cable knit pattern and a bit of an unexpected collar. I’m wearing a medium here, but I think I would actually prefer the fit of the small. It does have a tiny bit of wool in it, but it’s not scratchy at all! It’s just soft and warm. Also, I’m in love with the leopard tote from Rothy’s, but I’m so sad to report it’s not currently available at Nordstrom. Because of this, I’m not going to gush about it, but if it comes back in stock (fingers crossed), I totally will. You can click HERE for other leopard bag options if you just can’t wait. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules cream cardigan / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Pants don’t always have to be serious. These army green flared ankle jeans aren’t serious, but they sure are unique and adorable. 😉 They’re also stretchy, comfy, and flattering. WIN! WIN! WIN! They come in stone, maple, moss, teal, strawberry, and petal… so there’s definitely something for everybody. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And looky here, I’m wearing my white tee and denim jacket with these too. I’m telling you, if you don’t have a white tee and a denim jacket that you love, you need to fix that now. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag L.O.V.E. denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And here’s the same outfit, but with the leopard tote and neutral mules… white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** So what do you think? Can you see yourself in any of these pants? What about the white tee? And how fun are the bags and shoes? I hope you were able to draw some inspiration today for some outfits.

Title: Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Two market shocks less than three weeks into Trump's second presidential term have revived a playbook familiar to tech investors: "Buy the dip" is alive and kicking. Tariff fears sparked the latest rout Sunday evening, sending small-cap stock futures down 4% overnight — only to recover nearly all the losses by Tuesday close. Only a week before, "fears" of cheap AI from the likes of Chinese up-and-comer DeepSeek sent chip stocks crashing, led by AI poster child Nvidia (NVDA). On both occasions, investors not only bought the dip, but many bought it in the most aggressive way possible: with leverage. On Monday, Jan. 27, Nvidia suffered a 17% decline — its worst since the depths of the early pandemic in 2020. Yet, ETF strategist Todd Sohn, CMT of Strategas ETF Research, recently wrote in a note to clients that the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA ETF (NVDL) pulled in $1.6 billion singlehandedly last week. That product seeks to deliver twice the daily returns of the underlying Nvidia stock, which means that last Monday's 17% NVDA loss was inflated to 34% in the leveraged product. "It's a reflection that the 'buy the dip' mentality still exists for Tech," said Sohn. According to Vanda Research, during the height of the Nvidia washout, retail traders were funneling cash into the market at the highest rate since the November election period. "Mom-and-pop traders poured roughly [$4.25 billion] of new capital into US financial markets," said Vanda, measuring both ETF and single-stock flows over two market days. This "buy the dip" mentality isn't new, but it's become nearly reflexive. Years of easy money and rapid rebounds during the quantitative easing-driven years of global financial crisis recovery up through the COVID rebound conditioned a generation of traders. This mentality has a good chance of being tested again soon. (And maybe again, and again.) So far this year, markets have been sensitive to event risk, as the DeepSeek and tariff developments have shown. And with an active president in the first year of his term, stocks are already navigating a seasonally choppy stretch — one that tends to invite volatility even in calmer times. Factor in the sheer number of market-moving headlines, and even the most bullish strategists acknowledge turbulence ahead. As Tuesday's close underscored, this market may be sensitive, but the dip-buying optimism is unbowed.

Title: Wall St. Eyes 54% Upside in NVDA Stock as Options Traders Capitalize

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Despite China’s DeepSeek model disrupting the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem, Nvidia (NVDA) remains the underlying hardware king. Therefore, the red ink imposed on NVDA stock would appear to be a discounted opportunity — an opinion shared by top analysts and investors. So, the argument isn’t about whether NVDA is an exciting bullish opportunity. Rather, the question is how best to capitalize on NVDA. Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions. Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio On a fundamental level, questions exist about the supposed ultra-low-cost nature of the DeepSeek algorithm. Further, the idea that China is about to launch an AI paradigm shift could be misleading. Major enterprises like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are supply-constrained regarding their AI hardware needs. According to reports, they want to significantly expand their capital expenditures to boost their machine-intelligence capabilities. The average price target of Wall Street analysts is $180 per share, which suggests around 54% upside to come. However, bullish investors can harness a particular options strategy to replicate big payouts over weeks, not years. I’m bullish on a rebound in NVDA stock and continue to believe it will deliver strong returns for shareholders. However, there is a cleaner way of gaining exposure to the tech/AI theme and NVDA stock while generating even more substantial returns than traditional stock investing. The first order of business is to recognize the short-term nature of options trading. Unlike the underlying security, options are classified as “wasting assets” because they all eventually expire worthless. Therefore, if you wager on so-called cheap options — or options far out the money — you effectively engage in binary transactions: you are either winning or losing. Moreover, the progression of time exponentially reduces the option’s premium value as it nears expiration, which tends to mean options traders think short-term. Therefore, focusing on optionable securities like NVDA isn’t about broader fundamentals but pricing behaviors based on statistical trends. Primarily, the key element that makes NVDA stock attractive to options traders is its upward bias. Statistically, when considering data over the trailing five years, traders who enter a position at the beginning of the week have a 56.98% chance of being profitable by the end of it. Over four weeks, the long odds improve to just over 66%. In other words, outside of a truly compelling reason to be contrarian, the numbers favor taking a shot on NVDA stock. However, the market operates with human emotions, and responses can vary depending on fluctuations in the fear-greed continuum. Last week, NVDA stock incurred a loss of 3.79%. Whenever NVDA loses up to 5% of value over one week, there’s a 67.53% chance that the equity will have landed in positive territory by the end of the fourth subsequent week. Stated differently, there’s evidence that investors tend to buy the dip during sizable declines (for the record, negative weeks over the past five years in NVDA carry a median loss of 3.7%). This framework provides all the more evidence that speculators are justified in wanting to buy Nvidia at a discount. Viewing Nvidia stock pricing data in no other context aside from the temporal — NVDA may reach $134.36 over the next four weeks, assuming the positive scenario materializes. If the negative scenario occurs, there is a statistical risk that NVDA could fall to $111.79, according to the options chain expiring Feb. 28. From a dynamic perspective, NVDA is on pace to hit $133.70 per share in an optimistic scenario or fall to $111.79 in an adverse scenario. With this market intelligence, investors can execute a bullish options strategy called the bull call spread. Under a bull spread, the trader buys a call option and simultaneously sells a call at a higher strike price (for the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call. To be sure, the sale of the short call necessarily caps the reward at the representative strike price. However, the benefit is that the net cash outlay to enter the bullish position is discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to breakeven, improving the speculator’s odds of success compared to a call-only acquisition. Now, the beauty of the bull spread comes in the form of the reward. If NVDA stock reaches $134, that’s a decent 11.6% return. However, if you only wager a thousand dollars on NVDA, the nominal reward would be $116. In contrast, the bull spread can offer far better rewards, depending on the specific transaction. One of the reasons why investors tend to shy away from multi-leg options strategies like the bull call spread is due to the plethora of available spreads. How does one know which spread to pick? Let me tell you a little secret: it’s just like soccer. In the beautiful game, you improve your scoring chances by committing more players to the attack. At the same time, you leave yourself vulnerable to a counterattack. If you’re worried about conceding a goal, you can take speculative long shots without committing too many players to the attack, although the chances of success are low. In the options arena, the 111/134 bull call spread (buy the $111 call, sell the $134 call) for the options chain expiring Feb. 28 would be an example of a high-commitment attack. As of Monday’s close, the net debit required stood at $895 for the chance to earn $1,405 (a payout of 156.98%). So long as NVDA stock doesn’t drop below $111 by Feb. 28, traders may be able to salvage some intrinsic value out of the long call. However, if Nvidia implodes (i.e., the market’s devastating counterattack), the trader will lose the entire net debit paid to enter the trade. On the other hand, you can select the 132/134 bull spread. This trade only requires a $60 cash outlay for the chance to earn $140, or a payout of 233.33%. However, NVDA stock must reach $134 just to break even. Since both the long and short calls are well out of the money, there’s a strong chance you will lose the entire net debit paid. Still, it may be worthwhile to take that potshot because NVDA stock has such a strong upward bias. Turning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA price target is $179.81 per share, implying a 54.13% upside potential. Currently, NVDA may just be the most Buy-rated stock in the U.S. NVDA stock took a hit last week due to concerns over China’s DeepSeek AI model, but the selloff could be an opportunity in disguise. Despite the noise, NVDA remains the dominant tech hardware player, and history suggests investors tend to buy the dip. The numbers support a bullish outlook, with statistical trends pointing to a likely rebound in the coming weeks. Rather than simply following Wall St guidance and buying stock outright, options traders can take advantage of NVDA’s upside potential through a bull call spread. This approach leverages the stock’s upward bias while limiting risk. Depending on the chosen strike prices, traders can position themselves for a substantial payout if NVDA trades higher. Ultimately, it’s about structuring the trade like a calculated offensive play—balancing risk and reward based on market probabilities. Disclosure. Sign in to access your portfolio

However, if Nvidia implodes (i.e., the market’s devastating counterattack), the trader will lose the entire net debit paid to enter the trade. On the other hand, you can select the 132/134 bull spread. This trade only requires a $60 cash outlay for the chance to earn $140, or a payout of 233.33%. However, NVDA stock must reach $134 just to break even. Since both the long and short calls are well out of the money, there’s a strong chance you will lose the entire net debit paid. Still, it may be worthwhile to take that potshot because NVDA stock has such a strong upward bias. Turning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA price target is $179.81 per share, implying a 54.13% upside potential. Currently, NVDA may just be the most Buy-rated stock in the U.S. NVDA stock took a hit last week due to concerns over China’s DeepSeek AI model, but the selloff could be an opportunity in disguise. Despite the noise, NVDA remains the dominant tech hardware player, and history suggests investors tend to buy the dip. The numbers support a bullish outlook, with statistical trends pointing to a likely rebound in the coming weeks. Rather than simply following Wall St guidance and buying stock outright, options traders can take advantage of NVDA’s upside potential through a bull call spread. This approach leverages the stock’s upward bias while limiting risk. Depending on the chosen strike prices, traders can position themselves for a substantial payout if NVDA trades higher. Ultimately, it’s about structuring the trade like a calculated offensive play—balancing risk and reward based on market probabilities. Disclosure. Sign in to access your portfolio

Valerie Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented: "2024 was a year of record financial performance, underpinned by our increasingly diversified business model and driven by strong business income and sustained interest income. Our strategy and new management structure puts clients at the centre of our plans, and we continue to make progress against our key objectives. In 2024, we grew our funds business and European presence through the announced acquisition of Inversis in Spain. We also continue to support market adoption of digital assets by attracting new issuances on our D-SI platform while participating in important projects with industry partners to drive innovation across European post-trade. Our core activities continue to thrive. We have reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody closing the year over the €40 trillion mark. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway is now close to €2 trillion, while the funds depot also hit a new high of 3.6 trillion." Business performance The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period. FY 2023 FY 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €37.7 trillion €40.7 trillion +8 % +3 % Number of transactions 299 million 331 million +10 % +4 % Turnover €1,072 trillion €1,162 trillion +8 % +5 % Fund assets under custody €3.1 trillion €3.6 trillion +16 % +4 % Collateral Highway €1.67 trillion €1.9 trillion +15 % +1 % Underlying cash deposits (full year average) €23.7 billion €22.8 billion -4 % +3 % Euroclear's assets under custody reached a record €40.7 trillion, growing for the ninth quarter in a row, thanks to solid stock exchange performances and robust results in fixed income. Settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity throughout the year. Boosted by the ETF activity, combined with the rise in equity markets, fund assets under custody reached the record level of €3.6 trillion. The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now close to its prior peak level. Business milestones Advancing the funds business Over the past years, Euroclear's funds offering has evolved rapidly thanks to acquisitions such as MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2024, major clients in Asia, Europe and the US, including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess), Blackrock, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing their clients to have access to more than 250,000 funds. In 2024, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES, a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models. In July 2024, Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis, Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market. In Asia, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode, a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode, Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology. Reshaping traditional financial services Euroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024, Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council, it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold, Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace, Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC. Streamlined management structure Following the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new, expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients, business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally. Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impact Euroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation, Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues. The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme, long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations. Russian sanctions impacts Financial impacts of the Russian assets Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business. As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion, of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets. In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment. Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements, Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Issued on 16 December 2024, the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients. Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations. As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below. The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024. The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend. Euroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services. Guided by its purpose, Euroclear innovates to bring safety, efficiency, and connections to financial markets for sustainable economic growth. Euroclear provides settlement and custody of domestic and cross-border securities for bonds, equities and derivatives, and investment funds.

By Kanchana Chakravarty and Zaheer Kachwala (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet lofty expectations, reinforcing its struggles to grab market share from well-entrenched market leader Nvidia. The company's fourth-quarter data center revenue - a proxy for its AI performance - jumped 69% to $3.9 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $4.15 billion. "AMD may still be taking market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) side of things, but it remains a long way behind Nvidia and is struggling to catch up when it comes to graphics processing units (GPU)," said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. "Investors want the company to take the fight to Nvidia, but for now it is very much struggling to break the moat and disrupt its market position," he added. AMD is set to lose more than $19 billion of its market capitalization if current losses hold. Shares fell 18% last after more than doubling in 2023 on expectations of the company riding the AI boom. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock gained 171% in 2024. An increasing push by tech giants including Microsoft and Meta —both AMD customers — to develop in-house chips that are cheaper and more efficient could also dampen demand for AMD's off-the-shelf processors. BofA analysts said as Nvidia continues to outperform and custom chips gain more traction at hyperscalers, it might be hard for AMD to "win" the AI narrative despite its strong growth levels. The arrival of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek's low-cost model has made investors more sensitive, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. AMD's results and outlook have "knocked confidence further", she added. At least 22 analysts have cut their price targets on the stock, with the median now at $150, compared to $166.5 before the results. AMD's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 23.39, compared with Nvidia's 26.27.

While markets respond to the shift in demand created by Chinese AI company DeepSeek, AMD's CEO Lisa Su provided some comments on the state of hardware sales moving forward.

NVIDIA suffered the most from this crash, famously losing $600 billion in market valuation and 17% in stock price over a single day. AMD, however, has been somewhat resistant to the crash due to its relatively minor involvement in the AI sector. Since the DeepSeek R1 model launched on January 20th, AMD's stock price has decreased by just 2.3%, while NVIDIA is still down by approximately 15%. AMD's Instinct MI400 accelerator (Credit: AMD) Su also anticipates that AMD's next-gen Instinct accelerators will drive billions of dollars in annual revenue over the coming years, despite the speculation that less computing power will be required to produce next-gen AI models. Su was resistant to committing to a specific revenue figure for the accelerators. AMD's CEO is not the only major tech company to praise DeepSeek recently, with the chiefs of Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google each issuing statements in favor of the innovation. The common sentiment is that lowering the cost of artificial intelligence will be a net positive for the industry, with AI adoption only expected to increase. "First of all, I think, tremendous team," Google's Sundar Pichai said of DeepSeek. "I think they've done very, very good work." "First of all, I think, tremendous team," Google's Sundar Pichai said of DeepSeek. "I think they've done very, very good work." Even as AI hardware giants suffer historic losses, top executives from AMD to Google are praising DeepSeek's efficiency as a positive shift for the industry. Whether this optimism will translate into long-term gains remains the burning question.

Title: South Dublin soccer club blaming council policy shift for sidelining 20-year clubhouse campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/04/south-dublin-soccer-club-blaming-council-policy-shift-for-sidelining-20-year-clubhouse-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A 20-year campaign by a football club in south Co Dublin to get itself a new clubhouse is set to rumble on after it deferred its latest bid for planning permission having been told by local council officials it would not be successful. It is two decades since what is now Sallynoggin Pearse first approached Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council intending to replace its old and deteriorating clubhouse, its officials say. At the time, the local authority said its preference was to relocate the club around the corner from Pearse Park to Sallynoggin Park where they would be given access to a new facility which was then in the planning stage. Planning permission was subsequently obtained in 2007 but the project never went ahead and the then Pearse Rovers stayed where they were. By 2018 relocating the club became a priority when its existing clubhouse was vandalised. After the council initially said again it would build a new clubhouse in Sallynoggin Park if the club gave up its legal claim to a pitch a local land owner had allowed them to start using almost 50 years earlier, a deal was eventually agreed based on the club funding construction and the council proving the long term lease required to secure grants and loans once the project was in train. Since then, club chairman Richie Cummins says the club has deferred making of planning applications three times at the council’s suggestion. And it was told at a meeting in November the local authority would not now be honouring its commitment to the long-term lease. “The pre-planning stuff was all positive,” he says. “We are meeting the criteria for mixed-use facilities, not-for-profit groups sharing the facilities with sports groups. We’re ticking all the boxes. There is no issue with the building, no issue with the location of the building. So, we’re at a loss as to what the big issue is here.” Sallynoggin Pearse, the product of a 2010 merger between Pearse Rovers, where Paul McGrath played as a teenager (the hope is to name the clubhouse in his honour), and Sallynoggin Celtic, is a relatively small club. It has just two adult men’s teams, although Cummins makes the point it used to be much bigger and could grow again if it had more certainty over its future facilities. What it has done, however, is form a partnership with Granada FC, which has 90 teams and 1,500 young players. It hopes to use the new clubhouse along with a boxing club and kick-boxing club. Dublin Fire Brigade sports club are interested, a local gardening group would like to use it, and there is talk of a dancing club too. “It’s not just football,” says Cummins. “There’d be other groups using it which is important. The crime prevention officer from Dún Laoghaire said our current building (a 40ft shipping container) was vandalised and the previous building was vandalised because of not being used enough. But the council have used it as another excuse not to support us, saying we are looking for a community centre rather than a sports facility. We have never used that term but we do want something that is of benefit to the community.” He gives a vivid account of dealing with council officialdom, with everything — people, policies, allocated plots of land and pitch allocations — shifting over time. At one point, he and fellow club committee members Shane O’Brien and Paul Bishop say it was suggested they get a solicitor’s letter written to inject urgency into the council’s position — only for the official who had suggested it to stop engaging because they had “gone legal”. The council’s current offer is a vandal proof prefab which, the club was told, would cost more than €200,000 but contain just two dressingrooms and no showers. “Are you really expecting teenage girls to share that with either teenage boys or men?,” asks Granada chairman Ciarán Kane, who says wider frustration with the council over facilities and pitches in particular, has prompted clubs across the area to set aside their rivalries to co-ordinate their campaign for improvements. The lack of joined-up thinking, he says, is also evident in his own club’s home facility in Blackrock which, he says, they are delighted to have but which they have been told they should not make available to community groups during weekdays when it is underutilised. Sallynoggin Pearse might settle for that but instead find themselves frustrated by a shift in council policy which, says Cummins, involves a move away from granting long-term leases to clubs. He cites a recent example of that happening to another club. “We’re not asking them for a penny,” he says. “Just that they honour the commitment they gave us when we gave up our claim to a pitch they wanted. They are creating a situation here where nobody can trust them.” The club has, he says, widespread support among councillors and local TD Richard Boyd Barrett describes the council’s treatment of the club as “shameful” and “inexplicable”. “You would think they would be encouraging projects like this but instead they are putting obstacles in their way. It’s hard to understand, but it’s not unique, I’m not exaggerating when I say I am inundated with clubs in the area raising issues over facilities, pitches and particularly all-weather pitches,” said the People Before Profit–Solidarity TD. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council did not respond to requests for comment. Emmet Malone is Work Correspondent at The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: Turmoil as ADM trims 700 jobs, Salesforce slashes 1,000 after Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon axe

Significant layoffs continue to sweep across major big tech and corporate firms in 2025. Following similar decisions by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Salesforce have joined the expanding list of industry titans trimming their staff. According to Reuters, ADM, a major international grain trader, announced plans to cut up to 700 jobs to reduce expenses by $500 million to $750 million over the next three to five years. Juan Luciano, the company's CEO, stated that "softer market conditions and policy uncertainty" were the main reasons for these layoffs. The action comes as ADM adapts to a shifting global market environment, with difficulties expected in the upcoming year. According to a Bloomberg News report, Salesforce plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees while simultaneously hiring new ones to promote the sales of its new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The story (quoting a source familiar with the matter) said the displaced workers could apply for other roles within the organisation. However, it is yet unknown how the layoffs will impact particular divisions. The announcements follow similar moves by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, which also implemented widespread layoffs in reaction to market instability, industry changes, and economic challenges. Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, resulting in the affected employees losing their jobs with immediate effect and without any severance pay. Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, is laying off about 3,600 people, or 5% of its staff, according to a Bloomberg report that cited an internal memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Employees impacted will be informed by February 10. In the memo, Zuckerberg wrote, “I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.” According to reports, Amazon intends to make significant layoffs, possibly removing up to 14,000 administrative positions by the beginning of 2025. According to data from a Morgan Stanley paper referenced in news sources, this action is expected to result in significant cost savings of about $3 billion annually. Meanwhile, according to Business Insider, the company is letting go of about 200 workers in the US in its ‘Fashion and Fitness’ division.

Strong interest is expected in the upcoming forward purchase sale of 18 Newmarket Square, one of the few build-to-rent developments expected to come to market this year. It’s understood the development of more than 130 apartments in the Liberties in Dublin 8, which is still under construction, will be brought to the market by CBRE in the first quarter of this year at an asking price of about €80 million. 18 Newmarket Square, which is expected to complete around September of this year, was developed by Revelate Capital, an Irish specialist private equity real estate business, along with Valpre Capital, a London-based private equity real estate investment firm and a UBS-owned real estate platform, Aventicum Real Estate. It is located around a 10-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green and amenities are expected to include a co-working lounge, communal rooftop gardens and a landscaped courtyard, as well as about 500sq m of retail space. The Liberties development is not the only deal of scale coming to the market this year; the sale of a large city centre asset is also due to be announced, with an asking price expected to be in the region of €180 million. Last year residential transactions remained low, at about €466 million – the largest deal was the €150 million sale of the Point Campus student accommodation by German asset manager DWS. It was acquired by US fund Greystar. Developers say issues such as the rent cap, which is up for review at the end of the year, is a factor in the lack of new private rented sector developments. Other residential developments expected to complete this year include Marlet’s Claremont development of more than 500 units in Howth, north Dublin, and Lioncor’s development at Alta Verde in Blackrock, in the south of the city.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) -Blackrock plans to hire nearly 1,200 people to expand its two support hubs in India, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The world's largest asset manager wants to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities in India with the expansion, the report added. The iHubs, as the centers are known, are in the country's financial hub Mumbai and Gurugram, which is near the national capital New Delhi. The new hires will increase total headcount to roughly 3,500 in the two cities, and include more engineers and data experts, according to the report. Blackrock is also inheriting a so-called global capabilities center in India's IT hub Bengaluru, through its proposed deal to acquire data provider Preqin, Bloomberg reported. That center will have roughly 1,500 staff members. Blackrock did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

February 04, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX) Class Period: March 14, 2024 - August 7, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) increasing consumer engagement led to an increase in consumer incentives; (2) Cardlytics could not increase its billings commensurate with the increased consumer engagement; (3) as a result, there was a significant risk that its revenue growth would slow or decline; (4) the changes to Cardlytics’ Ads Decision Engine (“ADE”), which led to increased consumer engagement, led to the “underdelivery” of budgets and customers billing estimates; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Cardlytics’ business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Cardlytics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CDLX Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: AMD’s data center revenue comes up short, leaving investors dismayed
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/02/04/amds-data-center-revenue-comes-short-leaving-investors-dismayed/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T01:36:36Z

UPDATED 20:36 EST / FEBRUARY 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Investors bailed on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. late today after the chipmaker reported lower-than-expected revenue in its key data center segment, despite posting solid results overall. The company revealed fourth-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.09 per share on record-breaking revenue of $7.66 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. The results came in ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, with analysts predicting slightly lower earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $7.53 billion. However, the higher revenue was offset by increased costs, resulting in net income of $482 million, down from $667 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin, which measures the revenue that remains after subtracting the direct costs associated with producing goods or services, rose by a single percentage point, to 51%. AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su (pictured) hailed 2024 as a “transformative year” for the company, in which it generated record annual revenue and saw strong earnings growth. “Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,” she added. Su told analysts on a conference call that the company anticipates “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth in 2025.” For the first quarter of the year, the company is forecasting sales of $7.1 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, with a higher gross margin of 54%. That compares favorably with the Street’s forecast of $7 billion in sales. The numbers were largely positive, except for the performance of AMD’s most critical business unit, the data center segment, which produces computer chips for data center servers. That business has been growing fast in recent quarters thanks to the insane demand the company has seen for graphics processing units that power artificial intelligent workloads. It showed good momentum in the latest quarter, with revenue up 69%, to $3.86 billion. However, investors were hoping for even faster growth, and had expected the company to deliver $4.14 billion in data center revenue. They were not happy that AMD was unable to meet their lofty expectations, and the company’s stock fell more than 8% in extended trading, wiping out a gain of just over 4% during the regular session. The reaction was perhaps a bit harsh on AMD, which said the data center business grew its sales by 94%, to $12.6 billion, in fiscal 2024. That’s thanks to an increase in sales of its Instinct GPUs and also its EPYC central processing units, which power regular computer servers. AMD positions its newest Instinct MI300X GPU as an alternative to Nvidia Corp.’s chips, which dominate the industry, and it accounted for over $5 billion of sales in the last year, officials said. It has been embraced by some of the biggest data center operators, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Web Services Inc. One thing that may have struck investors was that AMD declined to provide a forecast for AI-related revenue for the coming year, which may add fuel to concerns that sales of the Instinct GPUs are slowing down. However, Su insisted that the company sees a “steep, long-term growth trajectory” that will eventually grow to “tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue” in the coming years. Somewhat surprisingly, Su praised the emergence of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek Ltd., which rocked financial markets last week when it became clear that its latest large language model could compete with the most advanced LLMs offered by U.S. companies, despite being built at just a small fraction of the cost. Some investors fear that the rise of lower-cost alternatives might hit chipmakers such as AMD, though perhaps not so much as AI developers such as OpenAI. Su also hailed the Stargate project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last month, which plans to invest $500 billion in building AI computing infrastructure to ensure the country remains at the forefront of the AI industry. “All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,” Su insisted. All of the talk and buzz around AI has meant that AMD’s other key business, which sells chips for personal computers, has largely been forgotten. But it put in a stellar performance, with sales rising 58% year-over-year, to $2.3 billion, above the consensus estimate of $1.9 billion. AMD’s smaller gaming and embedded businesses both declined, however, reflecting sustained pressures on those segments. The gaming segment saw sales tumble by 59%, to just $563 million, with the company pointing to a drop in “semicustom” sales. Meanwhile, the embedded chip segment saw revenue drop 13%, to $923 million. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said the market is likely being a bit harsh on AMD, as he thinks the company is growing very well in what is still a transitional phase as it shifts its focus to the data center. “Data center revenues were good, up almost 70%, and the client computing business had a record quarter, offsetting the shrinkage in its smaller gaming and embedded segments,” the analyst said. “It looks very good on the profitability side too, with operating income up more than 350%. The problem is that investors wanted to see turbocharged AI growth, but the data center business didn’t grow enough to satisfy such desires. It will need to pull off another epic quarter if it wants its investors to be really happy.” During the quarter, AMD’s venture capital arm, AMD Ventures, participated in a number of big funding rounds, including a $333 million raise by the cloud infrastructure startup Vultr Inc., and a $250 million investment in the AI startup Liquid AI Inc. Last November, the company also announced its intention to lay off about 1,000 workers, or 4% of its total staff, in order to free up more money to invest in AI development. Today’s after-hours price action means AMD’s stock is down 33% in the past 12 months, compared with a 9% gain in the broader iShares Semiconductor ETF.

UPDATED 20:36 EST / FEBRUARY 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Investors bailed on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. late today after the chipmaker reported lower-than-expected revenue in its key data center segment, despite posting solid results overall. The company revealed fourth-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.09 per share on record-breaking revenue of $7.66 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. The results came in ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, with analysts predicting slightly lower earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $7.53 billion. However, the higher revenue was offset by increased costs, resulting in net income of $482 million, down from $667 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin, which measures the revenue that remains after subtracting the direct costs associated with producing goods or services, rose by a single percentage point, to 51%. AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su (pictured) hailed 2024 as a “transformative year” for the company, in which it generated record annual revenue and saw strong earnings growth. “Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,” she added.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks.

Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains. That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates. On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point" "While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case." Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street. Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, "For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results." Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted pre-market, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft and margin commentary was mixed. January sales off to a slow start, too.

Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong. Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets. The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy. Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US. The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1% What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers. The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sign in to access your portfolio

US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe.

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain.

For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago.

Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow futures slide as Alphabet and AMD earnings fall short

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains. That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates. On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point" "While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case." Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street. Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, "For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results." Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted pre-market, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft and margin commentary was mixed. January sales off to a slow start, too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance. Toyota Motor (TM)raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs.

Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong. Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets. The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy. Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US. The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1% What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers. The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sign in to access your portfolio

Members of a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee have scheduled a Feb. 11 hearing to consider ways to limit the administrative state’s ability to impose new regulations. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 imposing a freeze on new regulations. House Republicans, meanwhile, say they plan to support legislation that would place additional controls on government regulations. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith, entrepreneur Magatte Wade and Hoover Institution Research Fellow Dr. Patrick McLaughlin are scheduled to testify at the Feb. 11 hearing. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Joni Ernst Takes Another Crack At Evicting Bureaucrats From Washington) “The American people trust President Trump and Republicans to strengthen our country,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That starts with transparency into government bureaucracy and cutting unnecessary red tape to make sure the American economy can thrive.” The hearing, titled “Reining in the Administrative State: Regulatory and Administrative Law Reform,” will likely discuss HR 142, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida. The REINS Act addresses executive overreach and ensures that every new major rule with a cost of more than $100M to be approved by Congress. Republican administration or Democrat administration, burdensome regulations affect us all. It’s time to #MakeItREINS and pass H.R. 277. pic.twitter.com/3EYmcIK5Wg — Rep. Cammack Press Office (@RepKatCammack) June 6, 2023 “The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright made it clear that Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, make the law. But more must be done to check the unconstitutional overreach of the administrative state,” Republican Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust, told the DCNF. “Not only should we codify the Loper Bright decision, but we should ensure rules that exceed the agency’s statutory authority are narrowed or repealed. This hearing will give members an opportunity to make those determinations.” The legislation would require both houses of Congress to approve “major rules,” defined as regulations with an effect of $100 million or more each year, through a joint resolution that the president of the United States would have to sign or veto. Currently, under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a regulation during a certain window of time, but the disapproval is subject to a presidential veto. President Joe Biden vetoed a bipartisan disapproval of one regulation targeting trucks in June 2023. The Biden administration proposed new regulations in 2023 targeting stoves and other appliances using natural gas, citing a study that says that gas stoves account for 12.7% of asthma cases among children. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged: Death Of The American Voter”) The Biden administration blocked efforts to start mining for copper and nickel near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota in January 2023, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency made a determination on Jan. 31, 2023 that would block the mining of 1.4 billion tons of copper, gold, molybdenum, silver and rhenium in Alaska in order to protect salmon. The Biden administration — saying they needed to fight climate change — also pushed for the adoption of electric vehicles, including the imposition of fuel-efficiency regulations for light and medium vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself.

Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower.

Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) One of Bill Ackman’s Top Stock Picks?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Bill Ackman’s Stock Portfolio: Top 9 Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other stocks to buy in Bill Ackman’s portfolio. William Albert Ackman, more commonly known as Bill Ackman, is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Famous for his concentrated portfolio, with stakes in only 8 to 12 stocks at a time, Bill Ackman’s recent portfolio modification has revealed that 47% of his hedge fund is invested in just three stocks. Analysis of his portfolio reveals that Bill Ackman invests in stocks that are mispriced relative to the long-term value of the company. Historically, this philosophy has served him well since Pershing Square’s total value was just under $13 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2024 with only 9 stocks. A longtime supporter of the Trump administration, Ackman has been vocal about the benefits that the newly elected president will bring to the investment front. In addition to the prospects of deregulation and corporate tax cuts that could allow for stock prices to rise and have made many investors bullish on the market, Bill Ackman has more vested interests in the Trump office. Pershing has a roughly 10% stake in the common shares of the government-sponsored entities. He took to X to discuss his hypothesis about how Donald Trump could help these giants exit government conservatorship and be recapitalized, leading to substantial shareholder gains for Pershing Square. In early 2024, Ackman launched a U.S. closed-ended fund called Pershing Square USA, Ltd., and talked about it during his 2024 letter to investors: “The launch of PSUS is one of a number of strategic initiatives we plan to undertake which we believe will increase the long term sustainability of Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., (“PSCM” or the “Investment Manager”), and will benefit PSH by reducing the performance fees that it pays. To this end, in June, we sold a 10% interest in PSCM, the proceeds of which will be used to anchor new fund launches including PSUS.” However, Pershing Square officially canceled its IPO just one day after filing with the SEC due to a $2 billion listing as opposed to its original target valuation of $25 billion. Finally, while announcing the IPO cancellation on X, Ackman wrote “We will report back once we are ready to launch a revised transaction,” hinting at the possible launch of PSUS without listing shares on a stock exchange. The stocks discussed below were picked from Pershing Square’s Q3 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of Pershing Square’s stake in them as of September 30, 2024. In order to assist readers with more perspective, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q3: 202 Pershing Square’s Equity Stake: $1.26 Billion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the only stock that Ackman holds in the technology sector, and hence the only holding that allows Pershing Square to participate in the race for artificial intelligence. Although Ackman has maintained its stake in the company across the second and third quarters of 2024, its equity stake has fallen from $1.38 billion at the end of Q2 2024 to $1.26 billion by the end of Q3 the same year. Popular for its leading search engine Google, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also involved in developing artificial intelligence, mobile operating systems, and cloud computing services to make money through the sale of advertising and various service fees. Although revenue from Google Cloud is growing rapidly, the company still generates most of its revenue from Google Adsense, the branch that deals with advertising. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s revenue for Q3 2024 was $88.27 billion, up 11% from the same period the previous year, and compared to the analysts’ expectations of $86.39 billion. Its net income for the quarter was $26.3 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 33.6%. Operating income was $28.5 billion, compared with $21.3 billion for the same quarter in 2023. It beat the consensus estimate of $1.83 by $0.29, reporting earnings per share for the quarter to be $2.12 against $1.55 EPS for the same period in 2023. Google has partnered with HP to integrate its Project Starline with popular video conferencing platforms, Google Meet and Zoom, and is set to launch the 3D video call technology in 2025. After refining the technology, initially designed for a booth setup, into a more accessible screen-based format, Google is now preparing to introduce Project Starline to the broader public to improve the video conferencing experience. In addition, Google Cloud, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has revealed that streaming powerhouses Spotify and Paramount Global are now using its newly developed Axion chip for enhanced performance and efficiency, further strengthening the position of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an industry leader in artificial intelligent. Oakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was the top contributor during the quarter. Despite ongoing litigation with the Department of Justice in its antitrust case, the U.S.-headquartered interactive media and services company’s stock price rose after posting solid third-quarter earnings. In the Search division, the company generated low-teens year-over-year revenue growth and management highlighted that they’re seeing strong user engagement with their new AI Overviews feature. The biggest upside surprise came from the Cloud division, where revenue growth accelerated to 35% and margins reached a record of 17%. This performance was driven by client demand for AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions as well as core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. We continue to believe Alphabet is a collection of great businesses that can unlock further value over the long term through its world-class AI capabilities.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 8th on our list of stocks to buy in Bill Ackman’s portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential for GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: AMD posts Q4 earnings beat, strong Q1 forecast

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and providing a better-than-anticipated Q1 forecast. The chipmaker's announcement comes the same day President Donald Trump enacted a 10% tariff on goods made in China and a little over a week after China-based DeepSeek rocked the tech world with its low-cost AI models. Despite the earnings beat and stronger guidance, AMD stock fell over 3.5% in after-hours trading. AMD is battling to take market share in the AI space from rival Nvidia (NVDA), which dominates sales of high-powered AI chips. At the same time, the company is contending with a continued slowdown in PC sales, even as the industry works to push consumers and enterprises toward AI PCs — computers that feature specialized processors designed to power AI tasks. For the quarter, AMD reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09 on revenue of $7.56 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $7.5 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company’s data center business, its largest segment by revenue, brought in $3.9 billion, just shy of expectations of $4.09 billion for the quarter. AMD’s client segment, which includes chips for PCs, generated $2.3 billion for the quarter. Analysts were anticipating revenue of $1.98 billion. The company also saw Gaming revenue of $563 million. Wall Street was looking for $487 million. For the current quarter, AMD anticipates revenue between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion. Wall Street had expected $7.0 billion. AMD shares have struggled throughout the last 12 months, falling 33% compared to rival Nvidia, which has jumped 80%. Still, that’s better than archnemesis Intel (INTC), which has seen shares fall 54% in the same time period. While Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods won’t impact the majority of the high-end chip market, since many are manufactured in areas like Taiwan, the broader market for electronics, including servers and PCs, which are built in China, will be impacted. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? If businesses and consumers are turned off by higher prices on those systems and devices, chip manufacturers like AMD could face slowing sales. Beyond the tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump has also raised the specter of tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors and products associated with them in a bid to bring manufacturing to the US. But those kinds of tariffs drive up prices for consumers for a long stretch of time, as building chip facilities is a complex task that takes years to complete.

Title: Shayne Bolton’s arrival in Ireland squad could give UK press a fit of the vapours
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/04/shayne-boltons-arrival-in-ireland-squad-could-give-uk-press-a-fit-of-the-vapours/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T20:44:42Z
Full Content:
Readers of UK Sunday papers might have thought this week that it was a case of right-back-at-ya from Irish rugby. The pithy observation of Sunday Times rugby correspondent Stephen Jones that Ireland “thrived on the needle-sharp incisiveness of Jamison Gibson-Park at scrumhalf, James Lowe on the wing, Mack Hansen on the other wing, Bundee Aki in midfield – and they were also well served by the odd Irish-born player” was met with this week’s announcement that Connacht’s Shayne Bolton and Munster’s Tom Ahern were to come in to the Irish squad. The truth is that the remark and the pair’s arrival into the Irish camp was a coincidence. But it has played out sweetly as Bolton, coming in for the injured Hansen, is an Irish-qualified player who was born in Pretoria, South Africa. It is not Bolton’s first breath of the thin air of a national squad. He was included by Simon Easterby in last year’s Emerging Ireland squad, only for an injury in the 33rd minute of Connacht’s opening URC game against Munster in Thomond Park to force him out of that tour. Irish-qualified through his grandmother, Bolton has been with Connacht since 2021 and last March signed a contract that would keep him in Galway for two more years until 2026. In November, Connacht coach Pete Wilkins spoke of the qualities that have made him a favourite in Dexcom Stadium. [ Shayne Bolton’s journey from South Africa can see him flourish with ConnachtOpens in new window ] “We’re delighted with the progress Shayne has made this season, and he is rightly establishing himself in the team as a fast and powerful option on the wing,” he said. “I am excited about his potential for further development over the next two years and he is another great example of the type of player that our supporters are so excited to watch and get behind.” Wilkins might have added that lightning pace also comes with the 24-year-old. Far from being a rangy winger, Bolton arrives compact at about 100kg and strong enough to also play in the centre. He joins that subset of players in the Irish squad that can seamlessly move around positions, as Garry Ringrose did last weekend against England. Ringrose switched from 13 to the wing when Hansen went off in the first half and reverted to the outside centre when the Australian-born winger returned. The move will probably excite a lot of people and even if it is only for a few days, it will be seen as an opportunity for Bolton to pick up the mood and character of life in the Irish camp. He was contacted initially in South Africa by Andy Friend, who was then the Connacht head coach. Friend knew the then 20-year-old was Irish qualified and that the pursuit of his dream to play professional rugby was greater than his desire to stay in college. In an interview in this paper last year, Bolton described how he left South Africa for the first time to travel alone to a country he didn’t know much about. It was during the Covid pandemic of 2020, and the aeroplane was ghostly empty. He had a row of seats to himself and everyone on board was wearing a protective mask, so there were zero conversations. When he arrived, the warm Irish welcome was quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because he was arriving from a red-listed country. At the time countries were listed as green, amber or red, with different safety protocols around each colour. The youngest of five children, Bolton was offered bursaries and scholarships but because his parents did not want to send him away to boarding school, he went to one close to where he lived. He played age-grade rugby for the Bulls at under-16 and under-18 and was in the Cheetahs academy for two years. However, he was denied an extension with the Bloemfontein franchise, although continued to play for the University of the Free State in the Varsity Cup. [ Connacht sign Irish-qualified South African prodigy Shayne BoltonOpens in new window ] In hindsight, timing was good, and it was when he was playing college rugby that the phone call arrived from Friend. “I’m very close to my gran,” he said in November. “She lives close by to my parents in South Africa, and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday, and I was always aware that my family comes from here. Her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” Gran is Noreen Stapleton, who originally came from the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. She can be proud that her grandson has already been charming people with his Irish accent. “We plucked him out of a backwater in South Africa and saw him as a project,” Wilkins told RTÉ. “It was a bit of experimentation, trying him as that power winger on the right wing and he’s just thrived on it, getting his hands on the ball and a bit more space around him. “So, there’s more to come from him. I think there’s incredible explosiveness and just a real confidence about him when he’s got the ball in hand.” Given this week, prophetic words.

Specifically, it helps "stabilize the Akin osteotomy during healing," the company stated. The Akin osteotomy "corrects the sideways deviation of the big toe." BTIG is bullish on the changes made by the company recently in response to intensified competition, saying that the moves have improved its outlook. BTIG is also upbeat on the company's upcoming products and believes that the firm is well-positioned to increase its reimbursements from payors. BTIG also reports that its survey about Treace's offering yielded positive results. The investment bank placed a $16 price target on Treace Medical. Additional Information About TMCI Analysts on average expect the company's revenue to rise to $225 million this year from $208 million in 2024. In the last month, the shares have risen 35%, while they have jumped 80% in the last three months. However, they are down 28% in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of TMCI, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Estée Lauder Laments ‘Lost Agility’ and Cuts up to 7K Jobs

Consumer pullback around the world is leading Estée Lauder to cut thousands of jobs. The beauty brand released earnings Tuesday (Feb. 4) showing declining or flat sales in its markets around the globe, especially in Asia, where sales fell by double digits. Speaking to analysts during an earnings call, CEO Stéphane de La Faverie discussed some of the factors that have hurt the company’s performance in recent years, including “subdued” consumer sentiment in China and a “narrow focus” on too few markets. “This was especially true in North America. Simply said we lost our agility,” de La Faverie said. “We did not capitalize on the higher growth opportunities quickly enough. In channels, markets, media and prestige price tiers nor fuel new consumer acquisition aggressively enough.” To that end, the company is embarking on a turnaround campaign that involves the elimination of 5,800 to 7,000 jobs, though that number takes into account reductions of employees after retraining and redeployment of some workers. Estée Lauder says it also plans to expand its presence in certain channels and markets to take part in “key growth opportunities in prestige beauty” while also boosting consumer-facing investments by increasing ad spending. “We know we didn’t make fast move in terms of new distribution when the consumer was moving,” de La Faverie added. “That’s what we’ve demonstrated with the move that we’ve made a few months ago with Amazon and many of us like TikTok Shop in Asia and even in the U.S. So we’re going to really measure how quickly we move in this channel and how much we can like to capture lapsed consumers but also new consumers.” The company also recently teamed with OpenAI recently to implement artificial intelligence (AI) across its brands. The companies developed 240 AI applications to analyze consumer data and create products for its various brands. “The facility processes data from consumer surveys and clinical trials for the company’s beauty brands,” that report said. “Two primary applications have emerged from the development process: one analyzes consumer survey data for fragrance development, while another processes clinical trial results.” As PYMNTS wrote at the time, other beauty companies are also investing in AI for consumer-facing and product development. For example, L’Oréal expanded its use of Modiface, an AI and augmented reality platform that allows users to virtually try on makeup and experiment with hair colors. And Sephora’s Virtual Artist tool lets customers find their ideal foundation shade using facial recognition and a skin tone database, improving accuracy and inclusivity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: GAMCO Investors, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2024

February 04, 2025 14:51 ET | Source: GAMCO Investors, Inc. GAMCO Investors, Inc. GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GAMCO Investors, Inc. (“Gabelli”) (OTCQX: GAMI) today reported its operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Financial Highlights Giving Back to Society - $80 million since IPO Since our initial public offering in February 1999, our firm’s combined charitable donations total approximately $80 million, including $48 million through the shareholder designated charitable contribution program. Based on the program created by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, our corporate charitable giving is unique in that the recipients of Gabelli’s charitable contributions are chosen directly by our shareholders, rather than by our corporate officers. Since its inception in 2013, Gabelli shareholders have designated charitable gifts to approximately 350 charitable organizations. On August 6, 2024, Gabelli’s board of directors authorized the creation of a private foundation, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, to continue our charitable giving program with an initial contribution of $5 million. Revenue The year over year increase in Funds revenues was primarily the result of higher average assets under management. The increase in Institutional and Private Wealth Management revenues was primarily the result of higher beginning of the quarter equity assets under management, which are generally used to calculate the revenues. The decrease in SICAV revenues reflects a change in the agreement for the merger arbitrage SICAV, an open-end fund available to non-U.S. shareholders, which became effective in December 2023. The change better aligns the financial arrangements with the services rendered by each party in managing the fund and did not have a material impact on the financial results. The decrease in distribution fees and other income was primarily the result of a decrease in equity mutual funds AUM that pay distribution fees. Expenses Operating Margin The operating margin, which represents the ratio of operating income to revenue, was 32.3% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with 27.6% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-Operating Income Non-operating income decreased $2.7 million for the quarter, reflecting the lower mark-to-market net gains on our investment portfolio for the quarter slightly offset by an increase in interest and dividend income. Other Financial Highlights The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 25.7% versus 24.7% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $182.8 million with no debt at December 31, 2024. Assets Under Management Assets under management on December 31, 2024 were $31.7 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from the $32.2 billion on September 30, 2024. The quarter’s decrease consisted of net market depreciation of $0.2 billion, net outflows of $0.2 billion, and distributions, net of reinvestments, of $0.1 billion. Mutual Funds Assets under management in Mutual Funds on December 31, 2024 were $8.1 billion, a decrease of 4.3% from the $8.4 billion at September 30, 2024. The quarterly change was attributed to: Closed-end Funds Assets under management in Closed-end Funds on December 31, 2024 were $7.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from the $7.5 billion on September 30, 2024. The quarterly change was comprised of: Institutional & PWM Assets under management in Institutional & PWM on December 31, 2024 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of 0.9% from the $10.8 billion on December 31, 2023. The quarterly change was due to: SICAV Assets under management were $9 million in the GAMCO All Cap Value sleeve and the GAMCO Convertible Securities sleeve on December 31, 2024 versus $11 million in those sleeves at December 31, 2023. 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund Assets under management in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (GABXX) on December 31, 2024 were $5.6 billion, up from $5.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The Gabelli Growth Fund – Up 35.8% For 2024 The Growth team of Howard Ward, CFA, and John Belton, CFA, commented on The Gabelli Growth Fund’s 2024 performance: “The environment remained favorable for growth stocks in 2024, underpinned by a resilient economy and the start of a Federal Reserve interest rate cutting cycle. Earnings growth accelerated for many US companies, aided by healthy consumer spending trends, robust technology investments, and continued cost discipline. Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained a key stock market theme, as capital expenditure plans across the hyperscale cloud computing group reached astronomical levels, and given a host of new AI-centric business models which have started to take shape. To date, this technology appears to be making some of the strongest companies, stronger, and to that end we maintained positions in many of the largest AI beneficiaries including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This group remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, and as of year-end more than half of the portfolio’s assets are invested across the Technology Sector as a whole. Outside of the Megacap Tech group, top performers to performance this year included Eli Lilly (boosted by continued success across an industry-leading incretin drug portfolio), ServiceNow (which is an early leader in AI software commercialization) and Intuitive Surgical.” The Gabelli Gold Fund – Up 15.2% For 2024 Portfolio manager Caesar Bryan commented on The Gabelli Gold Fund’s 2024 performance: “Gold performed strongly for the second consecutive year largely driven by overseas central bank purchases. However, gold equities underperformed the gold price. Recently the rise in the gold price has not been fully reflected in the profit margins of gold mining companies. This has largely been due to cost pressures emanating from a variety of sources, exacerbated by covid. But we believe the market may be too pessimistic concerning both cost pressures which are diminishing and enhanced revenues from a higher gold price. Gold equities are inexpensive relative to their history and on an absolute basis. But a catalyst is needed to alter investor perception. This could be gold backed ETFs adding ounces reflecting a recovery in investor interest in the sector, a decline in other asset markets which may highlight gold as a portfolio diversifier, increased takeover activity or simply continued strength in the gold price. Some of our smaller gold producers such as Lundin Gold and Wesdome Gold Mines, had stellar returns. Among our larger producers Kinross and Agnico Eagle contributed significantly to performance. We continue to favor mid capitalization gold producers with good assets that trade at a big discount to some of the larger producers.” The Gabelli Small Cap Growth Fund We utilize our own in-house team of over 40 industry equity analysts and portfolio managers to analyze the stocks in the fund, using our bottom-up research-intensive process and, more importantly, our accumulated and compounded knowledge of selected industry sectors. We use GAPIC – gather, array, project, interpret, and communicate data daily. We have consistently applied our Private Market Value with a Catalyst approach to help generate our long-term returns since the inception of the fund in 1991. ETFs In 2024, Gabelli Growth Innovators (NYSE: GGRW), managed by Howard Ward and John Belton, generated a 41.8% total return, the Gabelli Financial Services Opportunities ETF (NYSE: GABF), led by Macrae Sykes, produced a 44.6% total return, and the Gabelli Commercial Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE: GCAD), managed by Lieutenant Colonel G. Anthony (Tony) Bancroft, USMCR returned 22.2%. The firm launched its first active ETF, the Gabelli Love Our Planet & People ETF (NYSE: LOPP) in January 2021 to extend the tax benefits of owning exchange traded funds to our investors. Since the initial launch, the Gabelli platform has steadily grown the differentiated suite of ETFs. We are pleased with the client adoption progress and excited about this growth area of the market and positioning of these unique funds supported by our investment team. To accelerate the growth of these funds, each of the funds (with the exception of GGRW) has fee and expense waivers on the first $25 million of assets, whereas LOPP has a fee and expense waiver for the first $100 million of assets under management. Assets Under Administration AUA on December 31, 2024 were $1.2 billion, a slight decline from the $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. Return to Shareholders During the fourth quarter of 2024, Gabelli returned to shareholders $86 million in the form of a special dividend of $2.00 per share totaling $50.5 million that was declared in the third quarter of 2024, the repurchase of 1,304,358 shares for $34.4 million at an average investment of $26.37 per share, and a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share totaling $1.0 million. From January 1, 2025 to February 4, 2025, the Company has repurchased 12,971 shares at an average price of $23.95 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.3 million. On February 4, 2025, the board of directors increased the buyback authorization to 1.5 million shares. On February 4, 2025, Gabelli’s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, an increase of 100%, which is payable on March 25, 2025 to class A and class B shareholders of record on March 11, 2025. Balance Sheet Information As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and U.S Treasury Bills were $116.5 million and investments were $66.3 million, compared with cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills of $160.8 million and investments of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity was $136.6 million compared to $181.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The decline in stockholders’ equity resulted from the payment of $59.5 million in dividends, $49.3 million of stock buybacks, offset partially by $64.4 million in net income.

Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. These ETFs do not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:• You may have to pay more money to trade the ETFs’ shares. These ETFs will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information. • The price you pay to buy ETF shares on an exchange may not match the value of an ETF’s portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for these ETFs compared to other ETFs because they provide less information to traders. • These additional risks may be even greater in challenging or uncertain market conditions. • The differences between these ETFs and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the ETFs undisclosed, these ETFs may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the ETFs’ performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the ETFs’ investment strategies, however, this may hurt the ETFs’ performance. For additional information regarding the unique attributes and risks of these ETFs, see the ActiveShares prospectus/registration statement. You should consider the ETFs’ investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest.

The underlying securities are subject to credit and interest rate sensitivity risk, which could impact earnings. Additionally, since financial services firms are correlated to GDP, a decline in the economic environment could impact profitability. GGRWSecurities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business, and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market. GCADGovernment aerospace regulation and spending policies can significantly affect the aerospace industry because many companies involved in the aerospace industry rely to a large extent on U.S. (and other) Government demand for their products and services.

The Federation of National Trade Unions, known as CSN, said Tuesday it plans to petition a court to order Amazon to reopen seven warehouses and restore the 1,700 jobs lost as a result of the closures. Amazon announced in late January it would phase out seven sites in Quebec "following a recent review" of its operations in the province, which is the only location in Canada with unionized Amazon employees. The company said it would return to a third-party delivery model, enlisting subcontractors to handle deliveries. The CSN estimated that roughly 4,500 jobs were cut by Amazon and its subcontractors as a result of the closures. "Amazon thinks it can just shift the work to other corporate entities and outsource some warehousing and delivery operations," CSN President Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "What it calls the 'new business model' is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon's workers." Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said reverting to a third-party delivery model, which it used in Quebec before 2020, will allow the company to "provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run." "In making this decision, we've complied and will continue to comply with all the applicable federal and provincial laws," Agrait said in a statement. The CSN represents roughly 240 Amazon workers at a warehouse near the Montreal suburb of Laval. Workers at the site unionized last May, becoming the first Amazon warehouse in Canada to do so. Following the closures, Canada's industry minister, Francoise-Philippe Champagne, wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressing his "disappointment" over the decision, saying it "raises questions about your commitment to Canada and your Canadian partners." Champagne said the government would consider conducting a review of its current deals with Amazon. Amazon said the vice president of its Canada business spoke with Champagne after the company announced the closures. The company also faces growing labor pressure in the U.S. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union, while Whole Foods workers in Philadelphia voted Jan. 27 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Amazon employees at a facility in Staten Island, New York, in 2022 formed the company's first union at a U.S. warehouse, though they have yet to secure a contract. The group voted to affiliate with the Teamsters in June. WATCH: Tariffs' toll on e-commerce Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Tech layoffs this year: A timeline
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816579/tech-layoffs-this-year-a-timeline.html
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:40:51Z
Full Content:
2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies. Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. As it moves to invest more in AI and international growth, Workday is laying off 8.5% of its workforce and disposing of unused office space. Some analysts fear the cutbacks will affect the company’s customer service — unless AI can pick up the slack. At the same time as it’s hiring sales staff for its new artificial intelligence products, Salesforce is laying off over 1,000 workers across the company, according to Bloomberg. As of June, 2024, the company had over 72,000 employees, according to its website. Salesforce did not comment on the report. In 2024 the company reportedly laid off around 1,000 staff too, in two waves: January and July. Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees he intended to “move out the low performers faster” in an internal memo reported by Bloomberg. The memo announced that the company will lay off 5% of its staff, or around 3,600 staff, beginning Feb. 10. The company had already reduced its headcount by 5% in 2024 through natural attrition, the memo said. Among those leaving the company will be staff previously responsible for fact checking of posts on its social media platforms in the US, as the company begins relying on its users to police content. Despite intense demand for its data center capacity, Equinix is planning to lay off 3% of its workforce, or around 400 employees. The announcement followed the appointment of Adaire Fox-Martin to replace Charles Meyers as CEO and the departures of two other senior executives, CIO Milind Wagle and CISO Michael Montoya. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce. After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Alphabet Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings (CORRECTED)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will release its fourth-quarter financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, Feb. 4. Analysts expect the Arkansas-based company to report quarterly earnings at $2.13 per share, up from 69 cents per share in the year-ago period. Alphabet projects quarterly revenue of $96.65 billion, compared to $13.32 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in seven straight quarters and topped analyst expectations for earnings per share in seven straight quarters. With the recent buzz around Alphabet, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. At the moment, Alphabet offers an annual dividend yield of 0.39%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 20 cents per share (80 cents a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Alphabet, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Alphabet's $0.80 dividend: $6,000 / $0.80 = 7,500 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,509,225 worth of Alphabet, or 7,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.80 = 1,500 shares, or $301,845 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on GOOGL Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. GOOG Price Action: Shares of Alphabet fell by 1.4% to close at $201.23 on Monday.

NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2024: a timeline
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816662/tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-timeline.html
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:23:27Z

After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there were early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continued to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs seen through the year were an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. Here’s a round-up of some of the most significant. See news of more recent layoffs. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce. After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications. Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Roughly 8% of Microsoft’s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lion’s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition. German enterprise software giant SAP said this week that 8,000 jobs will be “impacted” by a large-scale shift in company priorities towards generative artificial intelligence (genAI). It’s unclear how many of the affected employees will be laid off, as the company has said many of the impacts will involve “voluntary leave programs and internal re-skilling measures.” SAP said the restructuring will not result in an overall loss of headcount. The company cut more than 3,000 jobs in 2023. Analysts expect the move to skew SAP’s workforce younger and more expert in genAI. Online retailer eBay plans to cut nearly 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 jobs—saying “in an official blog post that “headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business.” All of the company’s US workforce was told to work from home Wednesday as the firings were carried out via Zoom. Additionally, eBay said it would “scale back” on its work with outside contractors in a further attempt to rein in costs. The company fired 500 workers last year after sales slackened in the wake of the pandemic boom, according to NPR. Google’s ad sales team lost several hundred staff from its large customer department, part of the company’s move to automate some jobs with machine learning. Reports suggest that more staffers from the ad sales team were also let go in October 2023. The company also laid off hundreds more employees from its digital voice assistant, Fitbit, and Pixel teams earlier in the week. Google has been steadily shedding jobs since January 2023, when parent company Alphabet downsized its entire workforce by 6% across the board, putting 12,000 people out of work. Alphabet announced that it is laying off hundreds of employees from several teams, including engineering and the teams responsible for its digital voice assistant and hardware products, including Fitbit wearable devices and Pixel smartphones. The reorganization of the hardware teams will see a consolidation of different teams responsible for different devices, such as Nest, Pixel, and Fitbit, combined under a single team, which will be responsible for all devices, the news portal reported, adding that the activity has also seen the departure of Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman.

Title: 'New toys' are back on the menu at Apollo as it looks to M&A to grow
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/apollo-marc-rowan-acquisition-plans-argo-lending-4q-earnings-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:11:18Z
Full Content:
One of Marc Rowan's favorite refrains as CEO of Apollo has been "no new toys." So central has been this philosophy of focusing on execution instead of growing through M&A or new initiatives that it was the theme of the firm's 2023 holiday video. That time has now passed, Rowan suggested on the firm's 2024 year-end earnings call. Pointing to the firm's acquisition last month of Argo Infrastructure Partners, a $6 billion assets-under-management firm with a track record of infrastructure investments, Rowan said the firm plans to acquire companies that stand to help expand Apollo's lending capabilities. "You should expect us to continue to do modest M&A along the same lines where we are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate," Rowan said. Rowan's comments come amid a brightening picture for deals across the economy, stirred by the perception of a more business-friendly federal government and improving economic picture. At the end of last year, Apollo rolled out a five-year plan to double its private credit assets under management to $1.2 trillion. Rowan took care to say that the firm's dealmaking ambitions are "modest." He pointed to BlackRock's 2024 acquisitions in private credit and other alternative asset managers as an example of a broader convergence of public and private markets — a key Apollo theme. BlackRock plans to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners and private-market data platform Preqin for $12 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and has already purchased investors Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. Apollo's acquisitions, by contrast, will be "small-scale" said Rowan, saying they will help the firm create more products for large public asset managers, like BlackRock, to access the private markets. Apollo's private credit ambitions have so far been fueled by its insurance arm, Athene, with Apollo using Athene's balance sheet to fund its lending needs. When asked about the possibility that some large insurance assets may soon come up for sale, Rowan responded by saying the firm isn't going to just grow for growth's sake. "For us, growth is not just about growing the assets," Rowan said, adding that the firm already had to capital to lend a record $70 billion-plus last year. Instead, the firm wants to grow where it can lend, with Argo as a "prototype." "We are focused on expanding capabilities that can be immediately accretive buying something that in and of itself does not fit with our franchise," Rowan said. Apollo now has access to more than 20 individuals with experience investing in infrastructure, and those individuals now have much more capital to tap into and many more ways to invest. Jump to

February 04, 2025 13:09 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Low Risk High Growth Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stands against the other low risk high growth stocks. In the past few days, the reintroduction of tariffs by the US government has been a significant factor influencing market dynamics. A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% levy on Chinese imports, has heightened concerns about potential trade wars. These measures have led to increased market volatility, as investors assess the implications for global supply chains and corporate earnings. According to a report by news agency Reuters, based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure to US equities, marking the fifth consecutive week of net selling. This trend indicates a defensive posture, with funds anticipating potential economic slowdowns resulting from the new tariffs. Conversely, retail investors have shown resilience, injecting significant capital into the market, possibly betting on a resolution to trade tensions. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, another report by Reuters, based on a survey carried out by investment bank Barclays, reveals that investors are shifting away from traditional hedge fund strategies that rely on broad market movements due to concerns over market volatility in 2025. The Barclays survey of 325 hedge fund investors managing nearly $9 trillion found they want hedge funds to reduce beta exposure to as low as 5% or even zero. The report highlights that traditional hedge fund approaches like long/short stock picking, credit, and activism are losing favor. Instead, investors prefer funds using algorithmic trading and merger-arbitrage strategies. Multi-manager hedge funds, which operate multiple trading strategies under one firm, are now in high demand, returning 56% of investment share in 2024. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. To compile our list of the best low risk, high growth stocks, we made a list of firms with a beta of less than 1 and positive earnings per share growth over the past five years. The companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors during Q3 2024 were picked as the best low risk, high growth stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A corporate finance professional studying a financial performance chart. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) provides wealth management and other financial services. On January 21, the company reported net income for the fourth quarter totaling $1.8 billion, or $.94 earnings per share, excluding $177 million of pre-tax transaction-related and restructuring costs. Adjusted net income and earnings per share equaled $2 billion and $1.01, respectively. On January 13, the company announced the launch of the Schwab Core Bond ETF. It is the business’s second actively managed fixed-income ETF after the launch in August 2024 of the Schwab Ultra-Short Income ETF, which would provide investors with access to the company’s portfolio management team’s expertise, along with the inherent features of an ETF. Overall SCHW ranks 3rd on our list of the best low risk high growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SCHW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than SCHW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why CFOs Need To Control Prices In A Disrupted Economy

Plus: Two In Five Executives Feel Unprepared For Market Shocks, Interest Rates Hold Steady For Now, Trump Creates A U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund, Unions Score Wins While The NRLB Gets A Loss The whipsawing news about tariffs and trade wars during the last few days has caused confusion, quick calculations and frantic negotiations between global business partners. However, according to BCG’s most recent Executive Perspectives study, 85% of businesses have been preparing for this eventuality since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, and more than 60% of executives have increased concerns about tariffs. Does that mean they’re ready for all that’s been going on? Not exactly. The study found that two in five executives feel unprepared for this latest round of market shocks, despite the previous five years characterized by market shocks: the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and high inflation. The balance of executives’ outlook toward market stability has also shifted this year. In North America, just 29% are optimists—a drop of 6% from 2024—while 19% are pessimists—an increase of 4% from last year. Business leaders’ financial mettle has been tested vigorously over the last few days with a raft of announcements about tariffs. On Friday, President Trump said he was enacting his first set of tariffs, which were to go into effect today: 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. Global markets dropped, and leaders went into negotiating mode. By the end of the day Monday, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were postponed for 30 days—Mexico promised to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to prevent drug trafficking, and Canada is spending $1.3 billion on a joint task force designed to combat fentanyl, organized crime and money laundering. China’s tariffs are beginning as planned, with the Asian nation placing retaliatory 15% tariffs on several American-made goods, as well as U.S. companies. This type of news is difficult to keep up with, let alone use to forecast your business plans. And while many companies prepared for potential tariffs on China last year, steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren’t in many companies’ viewfinders. Forbes senior contributor Michael Lynch writes that how Trump appears to be using tariffs so far—as a threat unless other countries do something the United States wants—makes it especially difficult for U.S. businesses. The tariffs are largely unrelated to business outcomes. Even without the open question of tariffs, the U.S. economy is in a volatile situation right now, as quick decisions have far reverberations. Stephan Liozu, chief value officer at financial software company Zilliant, says that companies can do much better if CFOs have a handle on pricing and can make quick changes to respond to the larger economic situation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after last week's Open Market Committee meeting. The seesawing news on tariffs rocked the markets this week. In the U.S., all markets fell on Monday morning, but recovered slightly after Trump announced the pause on Mexico’s tariffs. However, the three major indexes closed down—the Dow down 0.3%, the S&P lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq minus 1.2%. The pause on Canada’s tariffs was announced after markets closed on Monday, and stocks slowly moved toward a recovery. But tariffs are far from the only decision of the last week that’s shaped the economic picture. Last week the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. It was the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. But Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore notes that tariffs tend to be paid for by consumers and U.S. companies in terms of higher prices, potentially increasing inflation—and therefore lowering the chances of additional rate cuts. Inflation and economic stagnation are persisting. Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December. GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. President Donald Trump, between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at left and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. New policy choices are also potentially reshaping the U.S.’s financial picture. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund—a state-owned fund that can invest in stocks, real estate, bonds, hedge funds and more that can insulate the government from economic stress. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be set up in the next 12 months, though it’s unclear where the money will come from. Trump said that perhaps TikTok could be put into this sovereign fund “if we make the right deal.” In his first week in office, Trump signed an order to create a working group on cryptocurrency, potentially creating a national digital asset stockpile, wrote Forbes senior contributor Jason Brett. Trump has been interested in cryptocurrency throughout his campaign, with his family creating the World Liberty Financial crypto venture last year, and $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins issued right before the inauguration. Former Forbes staffer Steven Ehrlich talked to former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Timothy Massad about Trump’s crypto ventures. Massad said it’s good that the administration is focusing on digital assets and is hopeful it will lead to a framework encouraging responsible development of the tech, but he sees no need for a strategic crypto reserve. A Costco Wholesale store in Chicago. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu. From the looks of it, price management software Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu believes we’re entering a period of hyperinflation, with costs going up and down all the time. For companies to perform better in times like this, he said CFOs need to have a better handle on and control of pricing—something that four in five companies don’t have a team dedicated to looking at. I talked to him about how companies should look at prices and plan for an uncertain future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How should prices be set? Liozu: I recommend the three Cs of pricing. You have to know your cost inside and out, and now the cost is changing on a minute[-by-minute] basis. That’s very dynamic and includes goods coming from outside, inside. The second C is competition. You need to anticipate what your competitors are going to do. How are we going to manage that hybrid inflation and tariffs? Are we going to do it better than you? Are they going to raise or decrease prices, et cetera? Then you have customer value. Right now, the perceptions of value are changing, and that means that you need to be aware that they might consider your offers, your product or services differently. The three Cs are in play constantly, and these three Cs are informing smart pricing decisions. Unfortunately, most companies will look at cost only, especially in periods of stagflation and inflation, but they need to really anticipate what competition is going to do and also the perceptions of value from consumers. What advice would you give to CFOs today that are trying to figure all this out? Number one is to take ownership of pricing. If no one is doing it and you don’t have a pricing team, create a task force, create a council and make sure you bring all these parties at the table, and say: OK, we’re going to do this better in a dynamic way, and with the right data. Number two is look at how pricing is managed, how long it takes you to do updates. Make a case for better investment in faster systems [for] optimization, automation. It pays for itself in six months when you look at money you save on not giving the right price to the market. Number three, I would say rethink your strategy with the three Cs. Most CFOs will go and focus on cost cutting, cost optimization and doing the calculations. Don’t forget competition and value because there is still a lot of value that can be captured from customers. There are a lot of strategies you could do in products and services to increase the value for the price. We’ve been in a period of disruption for a long time—the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and high inflation. But when things finally settle down again, do you think this focus on dynamic pricing will stay? Right now, disruption is the new constant. Based on how things are right now with China, Russia and trends around the world, we’re going to see ongoing disruption for the next 10 to 20 years. Which means you need to be automating, you need to have dynamic processes and systems, and you need to adapt your DNA to this kind of environment. If your company’s not prepared for that type of change, then you’re going to disappear. The CFO needs to raise that flag in the C-suite, but also has the responsibility to make sure on the side of risk management, this is managed internally. Because shareholders are going to look at this, and say, what are you doing? Generative AI company OpenAI is reportedly in discussions for a funding round that could double its value, the Wall Street Journal wrote last week. $40 billion: Amount OpenAI is reportedly raising now $340 billion: Value of the company if it completes that funding round. OpenAI’s latest valuation is $157 billion ‘We’re only getting started’: OpenAI said in the statement announcing its $6.6 billion funding round last October Most companies are looking to optimize costs, and this is best accomplished by using technology. Here’s what you can do by using tech and data for this task. Large companies are full of diverse cultures: in different offices, departments and countries. Here are some tips to work well with all of them. In Monday’s stock selloff fueled by panic around potential U.S. tariffs, which large company saw its stock fall by the biggest percentage? A.

February 04, 2025 12:01 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=126787&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

It encompasses people, processes, policies, standards, and roles that ensure the effective use of information. Data quality is a foundational aspect of data governance, ensuring that data is reliable, accurate, and fit for purpose. High-quality data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely, which is essential for informed decision-making. Additionally, well-defined policies and procedures play a crucial role in data governance. They provide clear guidelines for data management, ensuring that data is handled properly and complies with relevant regulations. Data Governance Pillars Data quality is the extent to which data meets a company's standards for accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency. It is a crucial element of data management, ensuring that the information used for analysis, reporting, and decision-making is reliable and trustworthy. Data quality is crucial for several key reasons, and below are some of them: High-quality data supports more accurate and informed decision-making. Clean and reliable data helps streamline processes and reduce errors. Quality data leads to better products and services, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. Poor data quality can result in significant financial losses. Adhering to data quality standards is essential for meeting regulatory requirements. The essential dimensions of data quality are described as follows: The following steps will assist in implementing data quality in the organization. By prioritizing data quality, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive innovation. Data policies are the rules and guidelines that ensure how data is managed and used across the organization. They align with legal and regulatory requirements such as CCPA and GDPR and serve as the foundation for safeguarding data throughout its life cycle. Below are examples of key policies, including those specific to compliance frameworks like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Define rules to check the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data during extraction and transformation. Require adherence to data standards such as format, naming conventions, and mandatory fields. Mandate profiling and quality checks on source systems before data extraction to minimize errors. Define protocols for detecting, logging, and addressing data quality issues during ETL processes. Define role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict who can view or modify data during extraction and transformation processes. Require logging of all extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) activities to monitor and detect unauthorized changes. Mandate encryption for data in transit and during transformation to protect sensitive information. Define policies to ensure only necessary data is extracted and used for specific purposes, aligning with GDPR principles. Establish periodic profiling of data at rest to assess and maintain its quality. Define specific metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, completeness percentage, duplication rate) that data at rest must meet. For data in motion, implement policies requiring real-time validation of data against predefined quality thresholds. Define levels of sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential, Restricted) and the required protections for each category. Ensure periodic backups and the use of secure storage locations with restricted access. Establish secure processes for generating, distributing, and storing encryption keys. Align with GDPR Article 5(1)(d), which requires that personal data be accurate and up-to-date. Define periodic reviews and mechanisms to correct inaccuracies. Under CCPA, ensure that data provided to consumers upon request is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Require quality validation of data before deletion or anonymization to ensure compliance. Define procedures to allow users to access, correct, or delete their data upon request. Require vendors to comply with CCPA and GDPR standards when handling organizational data. Align with legal requirements to retain data only as long as necessary and securely delete it after the retention period. Key aspects of data policies include: Clear and enforceable policies provide the foundation for accountability and help mitigate risks associated with data breaches or misuse. Procedures bring policies to life, and they are step-by-step instructions. They provide detailed instructions to ensure policies are effectively implemented and followed. Below are expanded examples of procedures for protecting data during extraction, transformation, storage, and transit, as well as for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data: Implement checklists to validate extracted data against quality metrics (e.g., no missing values, correct formats). Compare transformed data with expected outputs to identify errors. Automated tools are used to detect and correct quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, during transformation. Perform unit and system tests on ETL workflows to ensure data quality is maintained. Regularly review ETL logs and audit trails to detect anomalies or unauthorized activities. Use checksum or hash validation to ensure data integrity during extraction and transformation. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing ETL tools and systems. Create dashboards to visualize quality metrics for data at rest and in motion. Set alerts for anomalies such as sudden spikes in missing or duplicate records. Integrate validation rules into data streams to catch errors immediately during transmission. Schedule regular audits to evaluate and improve the quality of data stored in systems. Schedule periodic rotation of encryption keys to reduce the risk of compromise. Standardize the use of SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for moving files and ensure APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Separate sensitive data from non-sensitive data in storage systems to enhance security. Before responding to consumer requests under CCPA or GDPR, validate the quality of the data to ensure it is accurate and complete. Implement error-handling procedures to address any discrepancies in consumer data. Establish workflows for correcting inaccurate data identified during regular reviews or consumer requests. Before data is deleted or retained for compliance, quality checks are performed to confirm its integrity and relevance. Establish a ticketing system for processing data subject requests and verifying user identity before fulfilling the request. Define steps to notify regulators and affected individuals within the time frame mandated by GDPR (72 hours) and CCPA. Apply masking or tokenization techniques to de-identify personal data used in analytics. The following are the various generalized roles and their responsibilities in defining policies and procedures, which may vary depending on the size and policies of the organization. Data Governance Policy Makers A strategic decision-making body comprising senior executives and stakeholders from across the organization. Oversees the entire data governance initiative and ensures policies align with the organization’s strategic goals. Operationally manages the implementation of data governance policies and procedures. Serve as subject matter experts for specific datasets, ensuring data quality, compliance, and governance. Typically, business leaders or domain experts are responsible for specific datasets within their area of expertise. Ensure policies meet regulatory and contractual obligations. Provide technical expertise to secure and implement policies at a systems level. Act as end users of the data governance framework. Policies and procedures are periodically reviewed to accommodate evolving regulations, technologies, and business needs. By involving the right stakeholders and clearly defining roles and responsibilities, organizations can ensure their data governance policies and procedures are robust, enforceable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

Title: ROSEN, TRUSTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/04/3020617/673/en/ROSEN-TRUSTED-INVESTOR-COUNSEL-Encourages-Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Investors-to-Secure-Counsel-Before-Important-Deadline-in-Securities-Class-Action-NVO.html

February 04, 2025 11:52 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.

Bengaluru: Godrej Properties Ltd will look at profitable growth, expansion through land acquisitions, and build scale through higher market share, said a top company executive. The Mumbai-based developer has achieved 71% of its 2024-25 sales guidance of ₹27,000 crore on the back of strong housing demand and sales. In FY24, the company clocked ₹22,500 crore of sales bookings, making it the highest selling developer. “We will meet the sales guidance in the fourth quarter, which is said to be the strongest quarter in real estate. We have a number of launches coming up in multiple cities including Hyderabad, Noida, Pune, Gurugram. There are also two luxury projects in Mumbai which will be launched,” Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairperson, Godrej Properties, said in an interview. On Tuesday, the company reported a 152.23% rise in net profit to ₹158.20 crore for the October-December quarter, compared to ₹62.72 crore a year earlier. Revenue jumped 193.2% to ₹968.88 crore during the same period. “We are the largest residential developer in the country today, but we have a modest single-digit market share in the property markets we operate in. In FY24, we just about touched 10% market share in NCR, which is possibly our largest market. So, there is huge room for growth for Godrej Properties,” Godrej said. The three-month period through December was the sixth consecutive quarter when Godrej Properties clocked over ₹5,000 crore in sales bookings, the company said, underlying the sectoral tailwinds for India's residential real estate sector. In FY25 so far, the company has added projects of future sales value of over ₹23,000 crore, surprassing its ₹20,000 crore annual guidance. In December, Godrej Properties raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC, Blackrock, and SBI Pension, through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. "This capital allows us to further increase the pace of growth. We need to continue executing well, keep acquiring land and launching projects, and have a stronger presence across the cities we are present in, to gain market share," Godrej said. Around 80-90% of its group housing projects will be focused on the key cities it operates in, which includes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-National Capital Region, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Godrej Properties will opportunistically look at markets such as Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For plotted development projects, “we are happy to go to the top 20 or more cities”, Godrej said. After clocking around ₹73,000 crore of residential sales bookings in FY24, a milestone for India’s real estate sector, the top four publicly listed developers—Godrej Properties, DLF Ltd, Macrotech Developers Ltd and Prestige Group--are collectively targeting nearly ₹88,000 crore of sales in FY25.

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget issued a two-page memo directing all federal agencies to pause the disbursement of federal financial assistance, sowing confusion across the country regarding what portion of the trillions in congressionally-appropriated funds, which encompass SNAP benefits, rental assistance, and Pell grants, would be obstructed.1 2 3 4 5 Medicaid portals in all 50 states went offline without warning, and the New York attorney general led a 22-state legal challenge to the edict, which was duly rescinded by the Trump Administration.6 7 8 9 âI cannot promise you that everything is going to be OK,â wrote the National Labor Relation Boardâs acting general counsel in a note to staff four days after Trump brought the agencyâs operations to an effective halt by illegally ousting one of its Democratic members and vaporizing its quorum.10 11 12 13 Two commissioners were removed at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the body that protects American laborers from illegal discrimination in the workplace, which ordered its own employees, in what would represent a repudiation of their duty to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, to pause their adjudication of gender and sexuality-based complaints.14 15 16 17 Staffers at the Center for Disease Control and the Departments of Energy and Transportation were ordered to remove pronouns from their email signatures, and the 60-year old Equal Employment Opportunity rule was overturned, once again allowing federal contractors to engage in acts of discrimination against their workers.18 19 In an Office of Personnel Management email bearing the same subject line, âFork in the Road,â as the message sent to Twitter staff days after Elon Muskâs 2022 takeover of the social-media company, nearly all of the countryâs 2.3 million federal workers were offered a buyout and encouraged to go on vacation or find âhigher productivityâ jobs in the private sector; shortly thereafter, OPM staffers found themselves locked out of internal databases containing sensitive information on all government personnel.20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Dozens of senior Department of Education employees were placed on administrative leave, dozens of Department of Justice prosecutors involved in criminal cases related to the January 6 insurrection were fired, and more than 1,000 people at the Environmental Protection Agency received notices that they were at risk of âimmediate termination.â27 28 29 30 31 The Department of Agriculture ordered the removal of all mention of âclimate changeâ from its websites, the Defense Department elected to no longer recognize Black History Month, and a man at Quantico was photographed painting over a mural bearing the words Integrity, Cooperativeness, Stability, Diversity, Respect.32 33 34 Envoys from the Department of Government Efficiency, which lacks a congressional mandate and is thus legally not a federal department, sought and secured access to classified data in a Bureau of Fiscal Service system that disburses trillions in social security and tax refunds to millions of Americans each year as well as classified U.S. Agency for International Development intelligence briefings for which they lacked the required security clearances.35 36 37 The Acting Secretary of the Treasury stepped down in defeat and two senior USAID security officers, who had tried to physically prevent DOGE personnel from accessing the restricted material, were escorted out of the Ronald Reagan Building and suspended.38 39 40 âTime for it to die,â Musk tweeted of USAID, whose communications department was largely gutted shortly before its website went black.41 42 43 44 45 Billions in U.S. foreign aid were frozen overnight, with an exemption made for military assistance to Israel.46 âThese guys are terrible at everything,â tweeted a Senate Democrat regarding Trumpâs failure to deport as many immigrants as Joe Biden had in his first week in office, and House Democrats held an emergency Zoom meeting.47 48 Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, leading the premier of Nova Scotia to order the provinceâs liquor corporation to pull all 400 of its American alcohol products from its shelves, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to announce retaliatory tariffs on Floridian orange juice, the value of the Canadian dollar to tumble to levels not seen since 2003, and Canadian sports fans to readopt the Iraq War-era tradition of booing âThe Star-Spangled Bannerâ when it was played at NBA and NHL games throughout the weekend.49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 U.S. stock market futures plunged, Asian shares slumped, and wait times to take out gold bullion from the Bank of England octupled as a stockpile worth an estimated $82 billion was amassed in New York in anticipation of global trade war.57 58 59 60 âWe may have short term some little pain,â Trump acknowledged as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Vehicle Suppliers Association warned the White House of the supply chain upheaval threatened by the new duties, which stand to spike the price of cars, fuel, beer, and avocados.61 62 63 64 65 66 Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum, who initially rejected the allegation that her government maintained an âintolerable allianceâ with drug trafficking cartels, sent 10,000 troops to its northern border to intercept fentanyl trade, and Trudeau agreed to appoint a âfentanyl czar,â the two North American leaders later securing a one-month stay on the American tariff levy.67 68 69 Goods from China were slapped with an additional 10 percent in import duties, prompting the country to announce that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization, whose ability to mediate international trade disputes was kneecapped when the first Trump Administration blocked appointments to its main adjudication body, all seven seats of which remain vacant.70 71 72 âThese sabotage actions will not be tolerated,â the Latvian defense minister said after a fourth data cable running under the Baltic Sea was damaged in what are suspected to be covert attacks, leading Norway to seize a Russian-crewed cargo ship.73 74 75 On the Mediterranean Sea, the treaty granting the Russian Navy a military perch at the port of Tartus was terminated by the new Syrian government, which also demanded that the Kremlin, which is allegedly providing refuge to ousted leader Bashar Assad, pay the country reparations and âaddress past mistakes.â76 77 The Panamanian president announced that his nation would step away from the Belt and Road Initiative as Trump renewed threats to reappropriate the countryâs eponymous canal, through which $270 billion in cargo is ferried each year.78 79 80 The Suez Canal Authority announced that peace had been restored to the Red Sea while Israel continued its assault on the West Bank.81

Title: Salesforce Reportedly Cuts 1,000 Jobs While Adding AI Salespeople

Salesforce is reportedly eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company, Bloomberg reported Monday (Feb. 3), citing unnamed sources. It wasn’t clear which divisions were affected by the layoffs, the report said. Salesforce, a provider of customer management software, had nearly 73,000 employees as of January 2024, when its previous fiscal year closed. Salesforce did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Tech companies have gotten used to routine job cuts following a surge of layoffs in early 2023, according to the report. Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all announced cuts so far this year. Meanwhile, Salesforce has been hiring people for its new AI agent products, while also focusing on shoring up profit margins following pressure from activist investors in 2023, the report said. “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,” Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said when asked about the company’s profit focus in December, per the report. “We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?’” Last month, Salesforce debuted a point-of-sale (POS) operating system built on generative AI. “We’re not here to complement the status quo — we’re here to replace it,” Salesforce Senior Vice President and General Manager for Retail Nitin Mangtani told PYMNTS after the launch. “Retailers need technology that doesn’t just power transactions but transforms the entire shopping experience from discovery to checkout. That’s what this GenAI-powered POS is built to do.” Businesses must respect today’s fluid consumer journeys, which cover both physical and digital touchpoints, he said. For example, a consumer might happen upon a product while watching a TikTok video, buy it online, and exchange it in-store. “Unified commerce is not just a buzzword,” Mangtani said. “It’s table stakes. The consumer journey today is so intertwined that attributing success to one channel is nearly impossible.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Leftist Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Slashes Jobs to Prepare for AI Takeover

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a notorious leftist, is cutting over 1,000 jobs as the company’s new fiscal year begins, even as it ramps up hiring for AI-focused sales positions. Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Salesforce has announced it will be eliminating more than 1,000 roles as part of a restructuring effort coinciding with the start of its new fiscal year. The job cuts come despite the company simultaneously embarking on a hiring spree for salespeople specializing in its new AI agent products. According to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the private nature of the information, the affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific divisions impacted by the layoffs have not been disclosed. As of January 2024, Salesforce boasted a workforce of nearly 73,000 employees. The move by Salesforce reflects a growing trend among technology companies to implement regular job reductions, following a significant wave of layoffs that swept the industry in early 2023. This year alone, tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have all taken steps to trim their corporate workforces. While Salesforce is cutting jobs in certain areas, the company is also actively expanding its sales team to promote its new AI agent products. This dual approach highlights the company’s focus on maintaining profitability and efficiency, a priority that has been emphasized since activist investors applied pressure in 2023. In a December event hosted by Barclays Plc, Salesforce’s Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham addressed the company’s commitment to balancing growth and profitability, stating, “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business. We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?'” Breitbart News previously reported that Salesforce CEO was one of the many Silicon Valley leaders to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump after his stunning election victory in November: The turnabout is particularly striking given the extreme leftist politics of some executives now meeting with or praising Trump. Salesforce CEO and hyperleftist Marc Benioff, who owns Time Magazine, posted on X celebrating “a time of great promise for our nation” after Time named Trump its “Person of the Year.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

Dunnes Stores boss Margaret Heffernan, has been removed as a defendant and replaced with a company name in High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims building work has interfered with his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. He has claimed Ms Heffernan and others interfered with his property rights including by the building of a car park for Dunnes. The alleged interference began, he says, when scaffolding was allegedly unlawfully erected around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th-July 21st, 2022. [ Dunnes Stores chief executive seeks strike-out of man’s claims of property interferenceOpens in new window ] He also claims a scaffolding firm unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of gardaí and that work on demolishing his former home was carried out without appropriate permission from the council. On Tuesday Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed Ms Heffernan’s name could be removed as a defendant in the case and substituted with Dunnes Stores Better Value Unlimited Company. He also agreed five named gardaí from Blackrock and Dundrum stations could be replaced as defendants by the Garda Commissioner. He claims the gardaí wrongfully assisted in evicting him from what was his home. Last month, Mr O’Shaughnessy was granted interim High Court orders preventing Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding; Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; the five gardaí; and Ms Heffernan from interfering with his property. All defendants deny his claims. He had applied to Mr Justice Brian Cregan for the orders on an ex-parte basis, which meant only he was in court on that day. Mr O’Shaughnessy, who is representing himself before the court, returned before Mr Justice Cregan on Tuesday when he said he was “trying to get at the truth” in bringing proceedings. He said his home had been “bulldozed to a shell” and that Mr Corcoran, who is a scaffolder, was claiming ownership without any proof. Lawyers for Mr Curran, the gardaí and Ms Heffernan said Mr O’Shaughnessy had brought proceedings against the incorrect defendants and they were seeking that they be amended. Ms Heffernan’s counsel, Martin Hayden SC, said his client also wanted the entire case struck out against his client as the pleadings showed no cause of action. He also said his client had “no involvement, good, bad or indifferent with the property”. As well as agreeing to the change of name for Ms Heffernan and the gardaí, Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed that Mr Curran’s name as a defendant could be replaced with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Co Council. The judge gave directions for exchange of affidavits between the defendants and Mr O’Shaughnessy and said the case could come back in March.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices Has High Growth Ahead With A Great Valuation

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary AMD (AMD, Financial) is one of the most exciting chip companies in the world at the moment. Due to its strategic focus on AI, including a diversified approach centered on inference as well as training demand, the stock has a robust medium-term future ahead of it. Moreover, my valuation model posits a 35% margin of safety for investment assessed from a full financial breakdown of its earnings capacity and share count over the next three years. Additionally, my December 2027 price target of $290 is the conclusive reason I am highly bullish on AMD stock at its present valuation. Operational & financial analysis In my opinion, there are two semiconductor companies that are both the best-positioned in terms of valuation, financials, and operations to warrant heavy buying of their stock at the moment. However, there is a core difference between the two companies that makes AMD a more stable medium-term investment. I’ve mentioned extensively in previous analyses on Nvidia that it is likely to face a revenue decline in the medium term related to lower spend on AI infrastructure graphics processing units for model training. However, AMD is focusing on inference workloads, a potentially larger and more protracted market. At the moment, AMD's data center segment accounts for about half of its total revenue and grew by 122% year-over-year in Q3 2024. However, Nvidia remains dominant with around a 90% share of the AI graphics processing unit market. Unlike training workloads that require high-end graphics processing units, inference can leverage central processing units, graphics processing units, and even specialized accelerators, providing AMD with multiple avenues to compete as it transitions its focus toward inference to differentiate itself from Nvidia. In addition, while Nvidia has a comprehensive software ecosystem named CUDA, this is more focused on training utilizing high-performance graphics processing units like the H100. Inference workloads will be less reliant on CUDA, so AMD has an opportunity to compete with its open-source ROCm stack and cost-efficient solutions. In the next two to three years, AMD is quite likely to achieve an earnings without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of over 35% due to profit harvesting amid the upcycle of its AI ramp up and other diversified revenue streams. Moreover, this will likely coincide with around a 20% compound annual growth rate in its revenues over the time period. Such growth forecasts are based on my research and analysis of its current growth trends and market position and validated against consensus estimates from Wall Street. To be precise, I forecast $44.5 billion in annual revenue for Fiscal 2027 (ending December 2027), and earnings without non-recurring items of $8.37 for Fiscal 2027. Valuation analysis For my valuation model, I provide a full breakdown of the company's profit potential and share issuance. The model is capped at three years, in-line with my estimates above due to this likely being the highest-growth period to hold AMD stock in the foreseeable future. The company's basic average shares outstanding have been increasing at an 8.23% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. If this trend slows due to profit harvesting meaning the company is less reliant on equity financing to fund its operations, a compound annual growth rate of 5% in its share count seems plausible over the next three years. The company's current trailing 12-month shares outstanding equals 1.62 billion, so I forecast it will have 1.88 billion trailing 12-month shares outstanding in December 2027. AMD Shares Outstanding Chart As I forecast that the company will have about a 35% trailing 12-month net margin without non-recurring items by December 2027, the company's net income without non-recurring items would be $15.75 billion. Given my forecast that it will have 1.88 billion shares outstanding, this equates to an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.37. AMD stock is currently trading at a much cheaper price-to-earning ratio without non-recurring items compared to its 10-year median of just over 50. The current multiple is almost 40. Moreover, this indication of good value is not just due to cyclical profitability dynamics as the company's price-to-sales ratio of nearly 8 is only moderately higher than its 10-year median of 5.45, despite a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.9% compared to 2.5% as a 10-year median. I therefore consider AMD very reasonably valued right now. Indeed, a terminal multiple of 35 appears both consistent with historical valuations, industry norms (i.e. compared to Nvidia), and conservative given its robust growth horizon with no indication of a medium-term revenue decline for now. AMD and Nvidia PS Ratio Chart The result of my model is a fair December 2027 price target for AMD stock of $290, indicating approximately a three-year compound annual growth rate of over 35%. AMD's weighted average cost of capital is 16.83%, composed of 98.6% equity (costing 17.02%) and 1.4% debt (costing 3.75% pre-tax, 3.75% post-tax due to a 0% effective tax rate). When discounting my December 2027 price target back to the present day over three years using the company's weighted average cost of capital as my discount rate, the implied intrinsic value is $180. As the stock is currently trading at $115, the implied margin of safety in my model is 35%. Risk analysis AMD is not the only company competing in the inference market and attempting to disrupt Nvidia's moat in AI infrastructure. Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial) are aggressively entering the AI accelerator market, with Broadcom showing particular promise with potentially $90 billion in AI-related revenue over the next three years. Moreover, there are niche players like Cerebras and Groq which are poised to dominate portions of use-case specific inference through targeting lower latency and higher throughput with tailored chips. It is also worth considering that though we have Trump in the White House this year for a four year term, likely providing more geopolitical resilience through stronger leadership, tensions between the East and West are still high, especially surrounding Taiwan. If further hot wars break out or trade tensions escalate, supply chains and revenue streams could be disrupted. In a worst-case scenario of a market crash, I believe it prudent for investors to have a robust cash position at this time to mitigate risk and allow themselves to capitalize shrewdly on any major undervaluations that occur. This is the strategy being adopted by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and it appears a shrewd model to emulate. The greatest risk operationally and financially is that AMD has recently heavily concentrated its resources on AI. I do not consider this a bad thing, given that the AI industry is the highest-growth economic boom most people know of. However, it comes with risks for AMD shareholders if the company falls short of expectations. This could manifest if there is lumpiness in AI spending as enterprises optimize their budgets after initial build-outs, or if customers encounter any errors with its central processing units, graphics processing units, or AI accelerators, as two key examples. Conclusion I currently have a significant portion of my value trading portfolio in Nvidia shares, and I'm considering adding AMD shares at a higher or equal weight. I expect I will hold my AMD shares for longer than my Nvidia shares, because Nvidia is showing signs of significantly slower growth on the horizon and then, very likely, at least a minor revenue contraction. Therefore, I am only planning on holding Nvidia stock for about a year, but will likely hold my AMD position for two years or more. As my valuation model indicates, holding AMD stock for three years could result in a 35% compound annual growth rate, making it a top investment to consider at this time. One Community. Many Voices.

In the next two to three years, AMD is quite likely to achieve an earnings without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of over 35% due to profit harvesting amid the upcycle of its AI ramp up and other diversified revenue streams. Moreover, this will likely coincide with around a 20% compound annual growth rate in its revenues over the time period. Such growth forecasts are based on my research and analysis of its current growth trends and market position and validated against consensus estimates from Wall Street. To be precise, I forecast $44.5 billion in annual revenue for Fiscal 2027 (ending December 2027), and earnings without non-recurring items of $8.37 for Fiscal 2027. Valuation analysis For my valuation model, I provide a full breakdown of the company's profit potential and share issuance. The model is capped at three years, in-line with my estimates above due to this likely being the highest-growth period to hold AMD stock in the foreseeable future. The company's basic average shares outstanding have been increasing at an 8.23% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. If this trend slows due to profit harvesting meaning the company is less reliant on equity financing to fund its operations, a compound annual growth rate of 5% in its share count seems plausible over the next three years. The company's current trailing 12-month shares outstanding equals 1.62 billion, so I forecast it will have 1.88 billion trailing 12-month shares outstanding in December 2027. AMD Shares Outstanding Chart As I forecast that the company will have about a 35% trailing 12-month net margin without non-recurring items by December 2027, the company's net income without non-recurring items would be $15.75 billion. Given my forecast that it will have 1.88 billion shares outstanding, this equates to an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.37. AMD stock is currently trading at a much cheaper price-to-earning ratio without non-recurring items compared to its 10-year median of just over 50. The current multiple is almost 40. Moreover, this indication of good value is not just due to cyclical profitability dynamics as the company's price-to-sales ratio of nearly 8 is only moderately higher than its 10-year median of 5.45, despite a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.9% compared to 2.5% as a 10-year median. I therefore consider AMD very reasonably valued right now. Indeed, a terminal multiple of 35 appears both consistent with historical valuations, industry norms (i.e. compared to Nvidia), and conservative given its robust growth horizon with no indication of a medium-term revenue decline for now. AMD and Nvidia PS Ratio Chart The result of my model is a fair December 2027 price target for AMD stock of $290, indicating approximately a three-year compound annual growth rate of over 35%. AMD's weighted average cost of capital is 16.83%, composed of 98.6% equity (costing 17.02%) and 1.4% debt (costing 3.75% pre-tax, 3.75% post-tax due to a 0% effective tax rate). When discounting my December 2027 price target back to the present day over three years using the company's weighted average cost of capital as my discount rate, the implied intrinsic value is $180. As the stock is currently trading at $115, the implied margin of safety in my model is 35%. Risk analysis AMD is not the only company competing in the inference market and attempting to disrupt Nvidia's moat in AI infrastructure. Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial) are aggressively entering the AI accelerator market, with Broadcom showing particular promise with potentially $90 billion in AI-related revenue over the next three years. Moreover, there are niche players like Cerebras and Groq which are poised to dominate portions of use-case specific inference through targeting lower latency and higher throughput with tailored chips. It is also worth considering that though we have Trump in the White House this year for a four year term, likely providing more geopolitical resilience through stronger leadership, tensions between the East and West are still high, especially surrounding Taiwan. If further hot wars break out or trade tensions escalate, supply chains and revenue streams could be disrupted. In a worst-case scenario of a market crash, I believe it prudent for investors to have a robust cash position at this time to mitigate risk and allow themselves to capitalize shrewdly on any major undervaluations that occur. This is the strategy being adopted by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and it appears a shrewd model to emulate. The greatest risk operationally and financially is that AMD has recently heavily concentrated its resources on AI. I do not consider this a bad thing, given that the AI industry is the highest-growth economic boom most people know of. However, it comes with risks for AMD shareholders if the company falls short of expectations. This could manifest if there is lumpiness in AI spending as enterprises optimize their budgets after initial build-outs, or if customers encounter any errors with its central processing units, graphics processing units, or AI accelerators, as two key examples. Conclusion I currently have a significant portion of my value trading portfolio in Nvidia shares, and I'm considering adding AMD shares at a higher or equal weight. I expect I will hold my AMD shares for longer than my Nvidia shares, because Nvidia is showing signs of significantly slower growth on the horizon and then, very likely, at least a minor revenue contraction. Therefore, I am only planning on holding Nvidia stock for about a year, but will likely hold my AMD position for two years or more. As my valuation model indicates, holding AMD stock for three years could result in a 35% compound annual growth rate, making it a top investment to consider at this time. One Community. Many Voices.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: How Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) Drive Up the Cost of Health Care

Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:42:01Z

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) evolved from simple claims processors into powerful health care intermediaries that control drug pricing and access through their relationships with insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs engage in “spread pricing” — charging insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies and pocketing the difference — while also steering patients toward higher-cost medications through “rebate pumping” arrangements with drug manufacturers The current health care system, influenced by PBMs, underemphasizes preventive care while promoting long-term drug dependency, as ongoing prescription management generates more reliable revenue than prevention or cures Independent pharmacies and rural hospitals struggle financially under PBM practices, facing delayed reimbursements, strict audit requirements, and complex negotiation terms that often force them to either close or sell to larger chains Three major investment firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”) — have significant financial stakes across PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance companies, creating a web of interconnected financial interests Solutions include eliminating safe harbor rebate rules, expanding cash-pay health care models, separating PBM services from insurance companies, and implementing stricter regulations to improve pricing transparency * In the featured video, independent journalist Tucker Carlson interviews Brigham Buhler — founder and CEO of Ways2Well, a preventative care and health optimization platform — about how the health insurance industry works to keep us in poor health. Buhler’s career in health care spans over 25 years, during which he gained significant insights into the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The rising cost of health care in the United States has become a heavy burden for many families who struggle to pay for essential services. Patients often end up navigating a maze of insurance requirements, denials, and opaque billing practices without understanding why their treatments cost so much. Pharmaceutical prices add another layer of difficulty, with insurers and other entities setting guidelines that determine access. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, occupy a powerful place in this ecosystem. Initially created to simplify payments and negotiate prices, they have grown into influential brokers controlling which drugs are covered and how they are priced. Critics argue that these corporations operate behind the scenes, orchestrating deals that maximize their profits while pushing more expenses onto patients. In other words, PBMs engage in hidden collaborations and pricing manipulations that fuel a system that is more concerned with corporate gain than with patient well-being. By shedding light on the complex financial incentives at play, Buhler helps us understand why each step of seeking medical care — from preventive screenings to essential prescriptions — feels increasingly draining on both wallets and morale. He reveals an elaborate structure where individuals are funneled into long-term drug usage while basic preventative care is overlooked. Instead of ensuring affordability, PBMs exploit hidden markups and secret rebates to inflate insurance bills and keep people locked in chronic illness. For decades, researchers have warned that chronic disease often begins with lifestyle factors. A diet loaded with chemicals, refined sugars, and addictive formulas paves the way for obesity, metabolic issues, and diabetes. The logical solution would be preventive care, yet the system consistently underfunds or blocks such efforts. Instead, the patient, already in poor health, is nudged into a cycle of drugs. In short, insurance companies profit from setting premiums and reimbursements that don’t address the root causes. PBMs connect drug manufacturers with insurance plans and pharmacies. By deciding which medications get favorable placement on insurance formularies, they have substantial power to shape treatment pathways. They operate as the “middlemen,” determining reimbursement rates and adding costs that might not be obvious to consumers. Critics argue that each link in this chain — from the chemistry of our fast-food culture to the mechanics of corporate insurance contracts — feeds long-term drug dependency. People hope doctors will rescue them with thoughtful interventions, yet many find themselves steered into prescriptions rather than genuine solutions. The net effect is a growing population locked into care that does little to uproot their actual problems. Pharmacy Benefit Managers began as logistical helpers for insurance claims, intended to ease administrative burdens and secure group discounts on medications. In those early days, patients often benefited from lower prices and streamlined services, confident that PBMs were working on their behalf to rein in drug spending. Over time, PBMs took a more pivotal role by merging with major insurers, pharmacies, and even drug companies. This expansion gave them the power to decide which medications appear on covered lists and how high co-pays would be set. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, often called the “Big Three,” poured investments into many PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance firms, linking them financially. Regulatory agencies did little to keep up. Safe harbor laws, originally designed to allow certain discount arrangements, opened a door to hidden deals that few outsiders could track. Even government officials sometimes admit that they lack the tools or data to parse how PBMs arrive at final medication costs or distributions. This vacuum fosters multiple avenues for manipulative pricing. While PBMs publicly champion themselves as experts in cost reduction, many inside observers contend that the real focus is leveraging secret rebates and inflated prices. The result is an enigma for consumers and health providers, who see rising expenses but cannot pinpoint exactly where the money goes. Without greater transparency, the underlying profit mechanisms of PBMs remain locked away behind bureaucratic layers. A key accusation involves “spread” pricing, where PBMs charge insurers a higher rate than they reimburse pharmacies, quietly pocketing the difference. Though advertised as normal operations, this method can inflate costs at every transaction. One high-profile investigation in Ohio’s Medicaid system revealed how drastically these discrepancies boosted PBM revenues, convincing state officials that alternative approaches were more cost-effective. A second alleged tactic is “rebate pumping.” PBMs decide which drugs get priority coverage, sometimes favoring those with generous rebates from manufacturers. While patients believe they are following insurance rules, they might be guided toward medications that offer bigger profits for the PBM, even if more affordable or clinically superior options exist. This hidden arrangement undermines genuine market competition. Formulary manipulation can steer entire populations toward high-cost drugs. When PBMs place lower-cost medications in less accessible tiers or require complicated approvals, patients rarely realize they’ve been nudged into pricier choices. Over time, these directed behaviors funnel billions into the PBM’s revenue stream. Smaller drug makers, unable to provide large rebates, struggle to compete. There is also the “deny, delay, depose” approach: denying coverage, delaying approvals, and deposing providers to wear down patients who challenge any claim refusal. The bureaucracy can be exhausting, compelling many people to simply accept PBM-dictated medications or give up on certain procedures. On top of this, forced mail-order mandates reduce local pharmacy competition. Large PBMs often own chain pharmacies or mail services, ensuring yet another revenue channel. By dictating that some prescriptions must be filled through a mail-order affiliate, they tighten their hold on supply routes. Collectively, all of these maneuvers burden the sick while generating steady corporate windfalls. Small, independent pharmacies are the first to feel the weight of these arrangements. They operate on narrow margins, often waiting extended periods for reimbursement. Regular audits can penalize them if co-pays or deductibles aren’t strictly collected. Many find the financial strain overwhelming and convert to cash-only practices or sell to bigger chains aligned with PBMs. Hospitals, especially those in rural or underserved areas, also struggle. Heavy dependence on insurer contracts means they must accept the terms PBMs set, even if that means late or partial payments. The complexity of negotiations can leave hospitals uncertain of actual reimbursement amounts for surgeries and treatments. Over time, these uncertainties hamper hiring efforts, infrastructure updates, and overall quality of care. Patients shoulder the brunt of it. Co-pays and deductibles, often determined by PBMs in tandem with insurance companies, can skyrocket. A single major procedure might leave someone battling endless paperwork, fighting denials, or searching for a distant “in-network” specialist. Over time, chronic disease management grows more expensive, sometimes to the point where even standard treatments become a risky financial gamble. Though high costs might be justified as byproducts of progress, critics point out that patients who need life-extending therapies can be denied based on invisible profit motivations. These denials or lengthy pre-authorization demands can dangerously delay critical interventions. Overall, the system keeps many people in a perpetual state of fear, worried about the next surprise bill or approval hurdle. The troubling notion is that PBMs profit when people remain in long-term treatment. Managing diabetes, heart disease, or recurring infections, for example, yields continual revenue from drug sales, hospital stays, and follow-up visits. If earlier screenings or lifestyle guidance could prevent these conditions, insurers and PBMs would lose a recurring income stream. Thus, the system subtly discourages prevention. Preventive care often gets labeled as “non-essential.” Insurance companies may only cover minimal checkups or simplified blood panels rather than the deep investigative screenings that might detect cancer cells or metabolic shifts. Doctors who push for thorough evaluations can face audits or claim denials. This approach effectively steers clinicians away from digging into root causes and keeps them dispensing short-term fixes instead. Chemotherapy, obesity medications, and specialized therapies offer further insight. PBMs choose which oncology drugs or weight-loss injections land on the top tier of coverage, frequently guided by favorable rebate structures. For instance, prescribing an expensive cancer drug is more attractive to PBMs than promoting cost-effective solutions or advanced screenings. By focusing on maximum reimbursement rather than clinical optimization, PBMs foster a system that prizes medication adherence over true health. Even potential cures or preventative interventions fade in importance compared to the reliable flow of payments from chronic prescriptions. One of the biggest shields for PBMs lies in corporate media’s dependence on pharmaceutical advertising. Huge budgets flow from big pharma and PBMs into television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms. Investigative reporters who try to expose PBM tactics might find their stories curtailed. Advertisers dislike unfavorable coverage and influence editorial choices that help them maintain their revenue streams. Lobbying piles on another layer of insulation. PBMs, insurers, and drug manufacturers invest massively in shaping legislation. They aim to preserve safe harbor laws and defend the complexity of rebate arrangements. Officials, short on time and expertise, often accept industry talking points that claim PBMs deliver broad discounts. Meanwhile, advanced data remain hidden under confidentiality clauses, preventing thorough oversight. Alternative or cost-effective providers become immediate targets for negative coverage or red tape. Compounding pharmacies, which customize medications more cheaply, face extra scrutiny and high-profile condemnation if any recall occurs. At the same time, preventive clinics that promote advanced blood tests and deeper lifestyle assessments are dismissed as “non-traditional,” leading many patients to doubt their credibility. Without a major shift in how media and lobbying are handled, PBMs will likely continue operating in the shadows, benefiting from the current structure. Even well-intentioned legislators who propose reforms may confront a lobbying wall that distorts or dilutes their efforts. As long as the press echoes PBM-friendly narratives, the public remains unaware of the mechanics that inflate drug costs and stifle real medical innovation. Some argue that the fastest route to PBM accountability is legislative reform. Eliminating safe harbor rebate rules could force full disclosure of every cent collected from manufacturers. If the public saw how big the discrepancy was between list prices and actual reimbursements, the outcry might pressure policymakers to demand fairer pricing structures. Others propose expanding the cash-pay model so that pharmacies and clinics can sidestep PBM-dictated reimbursements. Direct primary care clinics, which ask for a monthly membership rather than rely on insurance, show promise. Patients pay transparent fees, sidestepping the labyrinth of co-pays, claim denials, and lengthy authorization steps. Critics say it may limit coverage for catastrophic events, but supporters argue it fosters clearer, more compassionate medical relationships. Another idea is to separate PBM services from insurance altogether. Insurers could be barred from owning or partnering with PBMs, avoiding the vertical integration that squeezes out independent competitors. If drug costs were set in an open marketplace, free from hidden rebates, local pharmacies might compete on actual prices, improving affordability for the average consumer. Finally, bold political will is essential. Some leaders talk about dismantling PBMs, a move that could reorder the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. Opponents decry it as radical, but the current system is unsustainable. If enough people demand an end to covert backroom deals, PBMs could be dethroned from their gatekeeping position, placing health care decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. The PBM conversation intersects with a larger reality: a culture of processed foods and tobacco-inspired marketing that has ravaged public health. By engineering addictive flavors and packaging, corporations profit from driving individuals toward chronic ailments like diabetes. PBMs then profit further from long-term prescription management. This chain of enticements traps many in endless cycles of medication. Preventive medicine would disrupt this pattern, but PBMs have little reason to champion comprehensive screenings. If fewer people develop metabolic disease, the volume of prescription-based revenue drops, undermining the financial base of PBM operations. In short, more robust screenings, especially for heart disease and early-stage cancer, would save lives but erode corporate balance sheets. The good news is that many patients are now starting to rebel and opt for things like direct-pay blood tests, customized diets, and health care providers who embrace functional principles — all of which weaken the PBM chokehold. By proactively caring for your body, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a chronic customer for expensive prescriptions. The goal, in essence, is to break the cycle that pairs hidden market incentives with manufactured disease. PBMs exert a profound influence on who gets what medication and at what cost, yet much of their work is veiled from public view. As explained by Buhler, this system, anchored in concealed rebates, inflated average wholesale prices, and manipulative formulary structures, is responsible for skyrocketing health care costs. Patients feel the sting through insurance premiums, high deductibles, and arbitrary claim denials. By peeling back the layers, we see a troubling alliance between PBMs, major insurers, and media outlets — a web that thrives on keeping Americans in long-term prescription cycles. Though reforms have been proposed, progress is stalled by extensive lobbying and carefully crafted narratives that depict PBMs as cost-saving heroes. Still, a rising movement demands real transparency and policy changes that might reset the playing field. Shifting the balance of power involves both political and individual actions. For example, we need to urge lawmakers to abolish secret rebate loopholes and consider stricter regulation of PBMs. On a personal level, you can also explore direct-pay health care models, improve your knowledge about preventive medicine, and support local pharmacies that sidestep the PBM structure. As noted in the featured interview, a failure to confront these issues leaves us with ever-increasing premiums, minimal improvements in chronic disease outcomes — and minimal trust in the institutions supposed to protect public health. But if genuine policy efforts and grassroots initiatives merge, we can begin to reclaim control. The prospects for cheaper drugs, renewed primary care, and a greater focus on prevention could then become more than just a distant hope. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Price On The Brink: Failure To Hold This Level May Trigger Crash To $74,000

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing renewed selling pressure as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China lead to fresh tariffs on both sides. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $91,000 on Monday, while major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also faced losses. The most recent installment of tariffs comes after the US enacted a 10% tax on all items from China, leading China to respond with its own tariffs on certain US imports, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. In another development, China has launched an inquiry into Google LLC over supposed antitrust infringements, intensifying the tension between the two economic giants. This market turbulence has wiped out the benefits from a short relief rally on Monday, which occurred after the Trump administration decided to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month. The weekend’s initial declaration of US tariffs had already triggered a steep drop in cryptocurrency prices. Investor trust in riskier assets has been notably affected, as US investors pulled a net $235 million from a set of 12 Bitcoin-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Inc.’s derivatives market decreased by 4%, reflecting a more cautious attitude among institutional investors. President Donald Trump, recognized for his pro-crypto position, has unintentionally brought more uncertainty to digital asset markets. Although cryptocurrencies experienced a rise following Trump’s election, the market now faces a difficult landscape marked by geopolitical strife and regulatory obstacles. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,970, about 13% shy of its all-time high. Meanwhile, US ETFs investing in Ethereum witnessed record trading volumes on Monday, with significant liquidation of leveraged positions rattled by ongoing trade uncertainties. The iShares Ethereum Trust, led by BlackRock, accounted for nearly half of the $1.5 billion in trading volume among a group of nine ETFs. ETH plummeted by as much as 27% on Monday, leading to over $600 million in liquidations within perpetual futures markets, according to Bloomberg data. Analyzing current price trends, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,180 as a critical support level for Bitcoin, based on MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) pricing bands.

Title: Across Disciplines: Frameworks For Investment Thinking
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendesmyter/2025/02/04/across-disciplines-frameworks-for-investment-thinking/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:07:02Z
Full Content:
Behavioural Economics... There was an interesting back and forth on X the other day in which U.S. academics debated the “seriousness” of economics as a discipline. It got me thinking about an idea that I’d been turning over for some time: the different faces of investment theory, the sense of the markets as a sphere that requires both art and science to comprehend it, where “merely” immersing yourself in the academic literature isn’t enough. I recognize how much of the way I think about investment is predicated on mental models and frameworks drawn from other disciplines. Occam’s Razor, for instance, or the Overton Window, or feedback loops. Back to the academic mini-controversy on X. Ben Golub, of Northwestern, pointed out that economics is a subject almost unique among the social sciences in the way it doesn’t demand that its practitioners are versed in the subject’s academic history. History vs Economics Another way of phrasing this is that, unlike other disciplines — history, for instance — economics as it is studied today has evolved dramatically, even unrecognizably over the past years and decades. It isn’t all that useful – one might argue – for today’s economists to spend their time reading Adam Smith, rooted as he was in the economic realities of the 18th century, a place of manual labour and nascent industrialization, just as you would not judge a geneticist for not knowing Mendel inside out. But you would, of course, raise an eyebrow if a literature student hadn’t read Shakespeare. For more on this subject, do read the always-brilliant Noah Smith on Noahpinion. Economics looks forward, rather than backward. As a discipline it is trapped between science and humanities, neither rigorously empirical enough for the former, nor interpretive or judgmental enough for the latter. A similar narrative might be forged around the art/science of investing. To some — my chartist friends — it is a science, reducible to a series of measurable and predictable patterns: inflection points, moving averages and momentum indicators. Chartists To behavioral economists, markets are closer to the humanities, a reflection of unnumbered human dramas playing out across the world: fear and greed, panic and exuberance. Behavioural Thinking To me, the markets are not about one thing, but about everything. To understand the movement of financial assets, you have to be an expert in geopolitics and history, sociology and mathematics, literature and anthropology. The markets to my mind are two seemingly paradoxical things at once: both machines governed by hard rules and also a narrative space where subjective forces express themselves. This is why for our MAIS Conference at University of Oxford each year, we seek to bring the best minds from across a wide range of different disciplines: not just markets, but the world. I've written before about the benefits of adjacent thinking here: The Age Of Adjacency And Moneyball Finance. Markets are stories we tell ourselves about the future. They are where numbers meet narrative, where abstraction collides with reality. But the tools we use to understand them — DCF models, CAPE ratios, technical indicators — are often blunt instruments for something so intricate. These tools assume that markets are systems of data, when they are in fact just as much systems of meaning. To see markets clearly, then, we must think like outsiders. We must raid the treasuries of other disciplines — philosophy, physics, literature, biology — for frameworks that they use to address the world. What can we learn from fields that have long grappled with complexity, ambiguity and the unpredictability of human behavior? Let’s start with science. In physics, a phase transition occurs when a system undergoes a dramatic transformation after crossing a critical threshold — water boiling, for instance, or ice melting. The system behaves predictably until it doesn’t, shifting suddenly into a new state. Markets, too, operate in phases: periods of calm punctuated by moments of chaos. But here’s the crucial insight: Phase transitions don’t happen randomly. They are driven by the accumulation of stress, the hidden build-up of fragility. The 2008 financial crisis wasn’t a black swan event; it was the boiling point of a system under strain, where leverage and opacity had quietly created the conditions for collapse. The physics of phase transitions tells us to look not at the event itself, but at the system’s thresholds. What are the hidden forces — illiquidity, concentrated leverage, shadow banking - that might suddenly tip the markets into a new state? In biology, ecosystems are governed by cycles: predator and prey, bloom and collapse. These cycles are not symmetrical or perfectly timed; they are messy, adaptive, and shaped by feedback loops. Markets, too, are evolutionary systems, where cycles of greed and fear drive growth and collapse. The biological model reminds us to look for meta-cycles - the evolution of cycles themselves. What happens, for instance, when AI begins to dominate trading strategies? Will it create new feedback loops that amplify volatility or reduce it? By thinking biologically, we stop looking at markets as static systems and start seeing them as adaptive environments, constantly reshaped by innovation and behavior. What about the study of literature? I tend always to have both a novel and a nonfiction book on the go at once: I feel like I learn as much from the former as the latter. Literary theorists often talk about the “intentional fallacy,” the idea that an author’s intent doesn’t fully determine the meaning of a text. Markets, similarly, resist simple interpretation. A stock price is a sentence in a larger story — a fragment of collective sentiment that means different things to different participants. Think of the rise of Tesla. To a traditional analyst, it might have seemed wildly overvalued for years, defying every fundamental metric. But Tesla wasn’t just a car company; it was a story about innovation, the climate crisis, and Elon Musk’s cult of personality. Its price was the fiction that investors told themselves about the future - a narrative so compelling it bent reality to its will, drawing capital that made the vision possible. What can literature teach us here? One lesson is that stories don’t have to be “true” to be powerful. Another is that markets, like novels, follow narrative arcs: euphoria, climax, disillusionment. Investors who can read markets as fiction - understanding not just the numbers but the underlying sentiment driving them - gain an edge in anticipating how the story might evolve. What emerges when we steal tools from physics, literature, biology, and elsewhere isn’t just a better way of thinking about markets — it’s a redefinition of investing itself. Markets aren’t machines to be mastered; they’re (super)human systems to be understood. They are, like ecosystems or novels, complex and adaptive, driven as much by psychology and sentiment as by fundamentals. The best investors already operate at this level. They understand that valuation models are necessary but insufficient, that no amount of data can fully explain the alchemy of collective behavior. They know that their edge comes not from predicting the future, but from interpreting the present, seeing patterns, thresholds, and narratives that others overlook. This isn’t an easy way to think. It requires humility, curiosity and the willingness to be wrong. But for those willing to think beyond the traditional tools of finance, the rewards of this cross disciplinary approach to investment are profound: a clearer understanding of the markets and the human impulses that drive them.

Title: Income Investors Will End Up Loving DeepSeek

HONG KONG, CHINA - JANUARY 28: In this photo illustration, the DeepSeek logo is seen on a phone in ... [+] front of a flag of China (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) Here’s my take on the DeepSeek selloff we saw last week: It’s a buying opportunity, especially for income investors. (I wrote a bit about this in last Thursday’s article. Since the market has rebounded a bit since, we’re going to talk about it more today. A preview? It’s not too late to buy the dip.) Why do income investors hold an edge here? Because they have a chance to buy Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI stocks, including some private-equity firms few people have access to, through closed-end funds. Tapping the selloff this way gives us two key benefits: The two funds in question—the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ) are the two funds we’re focusing on here. They work well when bought as a pair because they have different mandates: BST focuses more on the big caps of the tech world, holding stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. BSTZ holds some of those, as well, but also has smaller companies and private-equity firms focused on growth. That lends itself to more upside, but also more volatility—something BST, with its larger cap focus, helps us address. To really get at the opportunity we’re looking to tap into here, let’s talk a bit more about DeepSeek and what it means for AI and the tech sector more generally. Essentially, DeepSeek, which originated in China, was allegedly developed and trained for only $6 million. It’s now being offered as an open-source model essentially for free. With a cost of $0 for this AI tech, the reasoning goes, there’s no reason to spend billions on AI from companies like OpenAI or others whose stocks soared on the tech last year. Those include Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, all of which tanked on Monday, with NVIDIA, maker of the chips that underpin AI, falling 17%. Then, on Tuesday, the market erased much of its losses. Nvidia has more room to recover, though there could be short-term choppiness as investors debate what all this means. So, what should we make of this whole situation? Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that AI is critical to the stock market, and even a whiff of things going amiss could cause a reflexive selloff. The word “reflexive” here is key, because the selloff really didn’t make much sense. Free AI tools lower capital expenditure from businesses paying AI providers like OpenAI. That’s obviously bad for OpenAI and possibly Microsoft, which has invested almost $14 billion into OpenAI. Of course, that $14 billion is less than one-half of one percent of Microsoft’s market cap, so it’s really not that big of a blow. Maybe it’s bad for Alphabet? That doesn’t make much sense, either, as Alphabet has been giving away many of its AI tools to ensure people keep using Google services, like search. So it isn’t really a direct competitor to DeepSeek. And Nvidia? That stock’s selloff was the most egregious, and not because it was the biggest. Thing is, free AI tools mean people will use more AI. And since lower prices increase demand for a product, the more AI demand there is, the more demand there will be for Nvidia chips in the long run. DeepSeek’s new chatbot should’ve caused Nvidia shares to rise, not fall. Still, these stocks fell because this was a new story, and new stories create fear, which causes panic selling. Which is why we saw investors buy Nvidia shortly after. It’s not too late to join them—and as mentioned, BST and BSTZ are great avenues to take here. Especially when, in the case of Nvidia, we were in this same situation just six months ago. Back in July 2024, fears that both then-President Joe Biden and Donald Trump would impose controls on Nvidia selling chips to China caused the stock to fall 12% that month, with almost all of the drop coming in a little more than a week (shown below). July Tech Dip Other big tech names—like Alphabet (in orange) and Microsoft (in blue), as well as the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF (VGT), a reasonable proxy (in purple)—were dragged down alongside NVIDIA. Anyone who bought that dip did well, as all of these stocks have recovered since, and helped drive tech (again measured by VGT, in purple) to outperform the S&P 500, even after last week’s selloff. Tech Rallies That’s likely why some investors pounced on the DeepSeek–driven selloff. Which brings us back to BST and BSTZ, and the opportunity they give us to “lock in” a selloff that hasn’t yet fully recovered. Post-selloff, both BST and BSTZ now trade at unusually large discounts to net asset value (5.4% for BST and 10.2% for BSTZ). And those discounts are near their widest since the last tech selloff six months ago. So not only are we getting NVIDIA (the largest holding in both of these funds) at a discount thanks to the selloff, but we’re buying these funds when their own discounts are particularly wide. We can see by comparing the tech sector’s performance to BSTZ’s since its discount widened to 12% in August 2024 to now, even after the recent selloff. BSTZ Outperforms BST? Similarly, buying BST when its discount widened to its largest point in mid-August last year and holding to the time I’m writing this also resulted in outperformance, although a tad less than BSTZ’s, since BST focuses more on large caps. And the kicker: Buying these funds and holding while waiting for similar outperformance gets us an 8% yield with BST and 12.7% from BSTZ, for that 10.4% average payout. It goes to show that buying oversold CEFs, collecting their dividends as they recover, then selling when the market fully rebounds is a proven way to build your net worth while maximizing your income and diversifying, too.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin Reserve May Be Coming, But States Are Winning the Race

Almost half of the state governments in the U.S. are either on a path toward putting some of their money into crypto or already have, and much of a suddenly booming interest in tying their financial futures to the digital-assets markets has come after U.S. President Donald Trump showed support for a national stockpile of digit assets. In the surge of crypto legislative or financial efforts at the state level, 21 states are investing or looking into investing — generally in the industry's leading token, bitcoin (BTC), and sometimes also in less volatile stablecoins that are designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar, according to a CoinDesk analysis. With states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah and Texas already digging into legislation to open public funds to buy cryptocurrencies, such initiatives may outpace the effort in Congress targeting a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Sixteen state legislatures are looking at bills to either establish digital assets stockpiles or to allow their state retirement funds to be partially invested in crypto, most of them introduced in recent weeks. Officials in another three states are engaged in serious discussions about joining in, and the money managers for two states — Michigan and Wisconsin — have already dipped parts of their public employees' retirement portfolios into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If the states begin pouring portions of their public funds into bitcoin and other digital assets, it would potentially lock down billions of dollars of the tokens for extended periods, boosting the value of the assets still openly circulating. Another effect: The states are potentially setting up millions of people to have personal stakes in the health of the crypto sector — whether they want to or not. In several of the proposals, governments are looking to follow in the footsteps of Michigan and Wisconsin in pushing parts of their retirement funds and state pension investments into digital assets. Retired school teachers, law enforcement officers and other public employees will watch some of their financial security become dependent on the fluctuations of the crypto markets. Other pieces of legislation would instruct state treasurers to spend as much as 10% of their public funds on a strategic reserve, with some specifying that qualifying digital assets must have at least a $500 billion market cap, leaving only bitcoin currently meeting the mark. Arizona and Utah are building a lead after getting their efforts passed by legislative committees, but other states weighing some version of a crypto bill also include Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. Others, such as Alabama, Florida and Kentucky are considering proposals from state officials or on the verge of pursuing legislation. The states interested in digital assets reserves are predominantly Republican-majority in their politics, and the reasons the lawmakers say they're backing the bills include investment diversity and embracing technological innovation. The amount put away by the states could eventually be overshadowed by the U.S. government's own reserve, if that effort comes to pass. President Trump, in his wider executive order on U.S. crypto policy, called for his administration to "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile." The order suggested it may be built from government seizures of crypto in criminal cases. The idea had initially been pitched by Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who devotes much of her political bandwidth to supporting crypto and was named as the first chair of the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee. Her bill to set up a U.S. reserve calls for the country to obtain about $20 billion worth of the tokens in the first year and to get another 200,000 in each of the next four years, until the U.S. is eventually holding a million bitcoin. While Lummis' pitch has called it a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," it's not — like the petroleum reserve — designed for deployment when economic conditions warrant it. It's structured more as a long-term investment, requiring the U.S. to hold the assets for at least 20 years. That would be almost 5% of the eventual, finite supply of global bitcoin going untouched for at least two decades. Combined with whatever the states seek to stockpile, U.S. governments would secure a significant percentage of the asset, in addition to the towering reserves held by the U.S. ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Grayscale and corporate investors led by MicroStrategy. The states' interest in bitcoin potentially lands Satoshi Nakamoto's ultimate exercise of financial outsiders firmly in the realm of the insiders, adding the asset to the core functions of government. The Bitcoin white paper meant to establish a system of transactions outside of the need of financial-firm intermediaries or government oversight. States setting up bitcoin funds managed in part by new laws could become some of the most stable of the industry's institutional investors. And naming bitcoin as a "strategic reserve" puts the digital tokens on par with gold and oil as economic mainstays, despite the very different nature of cryptocurrencies and their practical weaknesses as an inflation hedge. From the perspective of their citizens or public employees, states that grab crypto stakes will come away with two potential outcomes: Millions of people will enjoy more comfortable and well-funded retirements or public services; or millions of people will watch a crypto crash eat into the safety net they're counting on. It could be "disastrous for tens of millions of retirees if government officials gambled with state pension funds to buy bitcoin or crypto," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that's critical of the dangers of digital assets. He called the idea of a government bitcoin stockpile "a brazen attempt by a handful of crypto billionaires and their political allies to take money out of Main Street taxpayers’ pockets to create artificial demand for a highly volatile product that suffers from boom-bust cycles, is full of fraudulent trading and pricing in unregulated markets, and has no socially legitimate use, but is loved by criminals." Wagers on the prediction site Polymarket have put the odds of one of the states beginning to set aside bitcoin reserves before the end of this month at 11%, and the chances of the U.S. setting up such a reserve this year at the national level are at 45%. It may already be a trend that governments around the world can't ignore. "We anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin," Fidelity Digital Assets researchers predicted in a look-ahead report for 2025. "Facing challenges such as debilitating inflation, currency debasement, and increasingly crushing fiscal deficits, not making any bitcoin allocation could become more of a risk to nations than making one."

Title: Vanguard dilutes diversity guidelines for US board proxy voting

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The updated policies exclude a recommendation that boards “at a minimum, represent diversity of personal characteristics, inclusive of at least diversity in gender, race, and ethnicity.” Vanguard’s updated U.S. proxy voting policy places an emphasis on complying with “relevant market-specific governance frameworks” and market-specific norms. The exclusion of recommendations comes as President Donald Trump has looked to reverse his predecessor’s legacy on diversity, equity and inclusion at the federal level and ordered agencies to put pressure on private sector DEI efforts. Vanguard still retains language in both its 2025 global proxy voting policy and U.S. regional policy that states its funds look for company boards “to be fit for purpose by reflecting sufficient breadth of skills, experience, perspective, and personal characteristics (such as age, gender, and/or race/ethnicity) resulting in cognitive diversity,” to enable effective and independent oversight. “The updates to the 2025 proxy voting policies do not represent significant year-over-year changes — they are a standard part of Vanguard’s annual review process, and reflect the evolving regulatory landscape across local markets,” Spero said. Vanguard’s 2025 global and U.S. proxy voting guidelines on board composition say that to assess how well-suited companies’ board composition is, its managed funds “seek fulsome disclosure of a board’s process for building, assessing, and maintaining an effective board well-suited to supporting the company’s strategy, long-term performance, and shareholder returns.” Those disclosures should include each board member’s “range of skills, background and experience” and their alignment with company strategy, the policies say. The changes were first reported by Reuters on Friday. Vanguard’s 2024 U.S. proxy voting policy is no longer available on its site, following the update, but has been preserved by web archive, the Wayback Machine. The updated voting policy is in effect as of Feb. 1. The policy changes come amid a broader retreat from public ESG and DEI commitments and falling support for environmental and social shareholder proposals. Vanguard supported zero environmental and social proposals in the 2024 proxy season, as BlackRock and State Street also supported fewer environmental and social proposals and overall support for related proposals fell to 16.2%, according to Diligent Market Intelligence. Vanguard also defended its decision to back ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods for re-election in 2024, after state finance officials publicly opposed him and his director slate for the energy giant’s lawsuit against a pair of activist investors. This proxy season will be the first under CEO Salim Ramji, after Tim Buckley retired in 2024. Once Ramji officially took the reins, over 8,000 individual Vanguard clients wrote to the investment firm’s top executive, urging him to put climate risk “at the forefront” of Vanguard’s investment management strategies.

Title: Trump signs order creating first-ever US sovereign wealth fund —and TikTok could be its first purchase

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/04/2025 5:07:08 AM PST by V_TWIN WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign US wealth fund — saying that TikTok may become one of its first acquisitions. A sovereign wealth fund is an investment fund owned and operated by a government. The world’s largest and wealthiest such funds are owned by China and resource-rich countries like Norway and Middle Eastern emirates. It was not immediately specified how the US endowment — the creation of which was first reported last month by The Post’s Charles Gasparino — would be capitalized, but Trump previously floated using tariff proceeds. It’s unclear if adding a stake in TikTok would require up-front investment, or if Beijing would offload it without charge to avoid a looming 10% levy that Trump announced Friday. “It’s a very exciting event. We’re going to have a sovereign wealth fund, which we’ve never had,” Trump said in the Oval Office — as News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison sat nearby.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Six new asset management companies (AMCs) are set to enter the fast-growing mutual fund (MF) industry this year and the asset under management (AUM) of MFs growing 32 per cent to ₹66.93 lakh crore in December 2024 against ₹52.74 lakh crore in December 2023. The market regulator has already given ‘in-principle’ approval to Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings, and final approval to Angel One and Unifi Capital. The market regulator initially grants in-principal approval after reviewing the application and assessing the applicants’ basic eligibility. After this, the applicant is allowed to start MF business by setting up the infrastructure and hire the core team. The regulator inspects the progress of the companies after six months and issues the final licence if the applicant meets all the criteria. Unifi, in fact, has filed a draft paper with SEBI for its maiden fund - Unifi Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund . In the past few months, SEBI has issued several partial and final approvals for the new MF players (applicants) to widen the MF reach and attract investors from smaller towns.AlphaGrep Securities, Ask Investment Managers and Monarch Networth Capital have also filed applications that are under consideration with SEBI. In 2023, five new AMCs entered the MF industry, but three of them entered through acquisitions. Vivek Sharma, Head of Investment, Estee Advisors, said while the MF industry has seen a tremendous growth, much of it was from equity schemes. The number of debt schemes has grown to 317 last year from 314 at the end of 2023. In contrast, equity schemes saw a significant net addition of 70 new funds. AMFI had proposed a Debt-Linked Savings Schemes to the Finance Ministry, but there was no mention of it in the Finance Minister’s speech, he said. Currently, the total expense ratio (TER) for debt funds ranges from 0.8 per cent for AUM above ₹50,000 crore and a maximum of 2 per cent for the first ₹500 crore. Providing incentives will definitely improve adoption of debt products, but higher TER means a lower return for investors, he added. Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager, Whitespace Alpha, said while more fund houses create an illusion of expanded choices, most of them will be equity-focused, particularly targeting small-cap, mid-cap and thematic segments. With too many equity funds chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks, liquidity constraints and valuation risks will increase, he added.

Title: What the EV Industry’s Challenges Reveal About Innovation and Regulation
URL: https://hbr.org/podcast/2025/02/what-the-ev-industrys-challenges-reveal-about-innovation-and-regulation
Time Published: 2025-02-04T13:00:44Z
Full Content:
A conversation with WSJ journalist Mike Colias on disruption and competition. Many consumers are buying electric vehicles, thanks to sportscar-like performance, government incentives, and personal motivations to minimize climate change. But the EV industry overall has revved and sputtered in unpredictable ways and offers a case study in managing innovation, regulation, and competition. Mike Colias, deputy bureau chief at The Wall Street Journal, explains the complex landscape that incumbents such as GM and Ford and start-ups like Tesla find themselves in. Through stories of iconic industry executives and bold competitive moves, he shares insights that leaders in every industry can learn from. Colias wrote the new book Inevitable: Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch. Innovation often happens slowly and then all at once. That’s the felt reality of disruptive innovation. Basically, if a big company doesn’t watch out, a startup can come in with a new inferior offering. Ignored long enough that upstart can improve its product and eventually, seemingly suddenly put the incumbent out of business. That phenomenon is well understood now. What’s hard is getting the timing right. You move too quickly to the new tech and customers aren’t there yet, you’re out of luck. Wait too long, someone else eats your lunch. Even when established companies recognize disruptive innovations and deliberately bring them on, it’s a complex balancing act to transition the business for the future. Case in point, actually cases in point, electric vehicles. The car industry is bursting with disruptive innovation case studies in the making. You’ll find many of them to learn from in the new book, Inevitable, Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. The author is Mike Colias, Deputy Bureau Chief at the Wall Street Journal, and he joins us now. Hi, Mike. MIKE COLIAS: Hi, Curt. Thanks for having me on. CURT NICKISCH: It’s such a fascinating industry, of legacy companies, amazing brands, this consumer technology that we all totally get and are totally familiar with. A lot of emotion and economics involved. Then you’ve got electric vehicle technology, you’ve got driverless automation technology. It’s just a really amazing business. I think maybe we should set the scene here. Why do customers buy electric vehicles? What do companies know that they’re looking for? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, we’ve seen this evolution playing out now for about 15 years. It was 2010 is when GM came out with this Chevrolet Volt. It was actually a plugin hybrid. Nissan had the Leaf. That was a full EV and they came out about the same time and it was a big deal. It was a breakthrough. What you saw, I think, from 2010 to early this decade was a lot of people bought it for certainly environmental reasons. You had a lot of people who were interested in the technology, who wanted to just have the latest thing, who wanted to have the first EV in the neighborhood, those early adopters. As we’ve gotten to recent years and you’ve seen more and more models coming out – we can talk about why the industry has tried to pivot so hard toward EVs – more and more people are interested in them. I mean, surveys show that of the average car buyer, roughly half of them are at least open to the idea of electrics, but it’s less of the early adopter who’s going to, “Hey, I’ll pay 20 grand above sticker for this new electric truck,” and it’s more of a discerning buyer who’s maybe on the fence about it and has to be convinced. So I think that’s where you’re starting to see some headwinds in the industry. All the car companies went really big for a number of reasons. Now sales are still going up in the U.S., but the companies are having a harder time getting people to make that jump to electric because they’re more your everyday buyer. They’re trying to figure out how it fits into their life rather than just so enamored by the technology or what it can do for the environment. CURT NICKISCH: Why do people get enamored by the technology? I think what advantages do electric vehicles have? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think for a long time they were thought of as these glorified golf carts. I don’t think people really thought that they could have the capability and reliability, fun to drive, all the reasons why a lot of people choose their vehicle. I think Tesla really showed that EVs can be sporty and fun to drive, and so you get into one today and now many, many brands, I mean, the choice has really exploded in the last couple years. You can expect it to be super quiet, very zippy. You feel like you’re driving the future a bit. I’ll credit this to a colleague of mine, Dan Neil who writes a column for the Wall Street Journal on cars. He said, “If you drive an electric, going back to a gas engine car is like going back to whale oil lamps.” You know, not everybody. There are examples of people who just realize after six months, “Hey, maybe this isn’t for me,” but by and large people don’t go back. CURT NICKISCH: Is there any doubt in your mind that the industry is going to shift to electric vehicles? I mean, some people might say it’s a fad or it’s just not going to last. Inevitable, the title of your book came from Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, who said it’s an inevitable transition. What’s your opinion from your experience? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s funny, we actually titled the book before he said that, and so it was nice that we’re getting some backup from the industry. No, I think it is interesting because from the time I started the book, let’s say 2021 ish, it was all systems go. All of the companies were saying, “We’re pouring all of our capital into this. We’re going to have dozens of electric vehicles by X date.” GM made a lot of news when they said they were going to be fully electric by 2035. Then the slowdown, which we’ve already talked about, where consumers are like, well, not quite so fast. I think they did to a certain extent leave the consumer out of the picture when they were making these decisions. So now it is messy. You’ve got companies who are starting to slow walk some of their factory investments or cancel models. President Trump and Republicans have been pretty harsh on electric vehicles. They’ve made it known that… It’s become very politicized in the last couple of years, and we can talk a little bit more about why that is. So right now it looks like a tough time for EVs and it is in the U.S. That gets to why I think this goes from where it is now to inevitable is, in China… So everyone talks about the EV transition. There’s multiple transitions unfolding around the globe. China is the leader in EVs. Nearly half of all car sales in China are now either electric or plug in hybrid. This is really gets back to why it’s so difficult to be the leader of a car company today. If you’re Mary Barra sitting in Detroit. She took over in early 2014. One of her lines I remember at the time was we’re going to see more change in the next five years than we have in the last 50. Mary was one of the first big car company CEOs to declare this is what we’re doing, this is the path. For the company that puts out big Cadillac escalades and Corvettes that roar around the track, 8 cylinder, that’s a jarring thing to hear. Mary gets a lot of the credit for that. It’s a bit of an unfinished story because the execution of thoses EVs that she put the plans in place for the last decade have kind of stumbled, at least in the last several years. And now they’re starting to get really good cars out and they’re hitting this sort of demand headwind where consumers maybe aren’t showing up in ways that they expected. And only 5% of your sales are electric and you’re losing billions of dollars on that, and you’re making, I think they’re going to make something like 12 to 14 billion, that’s what they’ll have made in 2024. That all comes from big pickup trucks and SUVs. How do you play that? Europe’s somewhere in the middle, 20 to 25% of their sales are EVs. So you’ve got to decide, okay, am I going to lean into this thing that right now my investors don’t like and I’m losing a ton of money on because I know that in the future I’ll probably have to compete. She’s on record as saying the future is electric, so they have to put their money where their mouth is, but it hurts right now to do that. CURT NICKISCH: She’s one of the really interesting case studies in the book. Somebody who’s trying to manage that transition. You painted a picture where GM is making a lot of money by selling its quote, unquote, legacy vehicles, but also not seeing its stock price go up. Meanwhile, there’s this other company, Tesla, that’s putting out all electric vehicles, only electric vehicles. It’s not making money at that time early on, but its stock price was going up because investors thought that that’s where the future was going to be. And it was just interesting to see somebody who was making money as a CEO, but envious of the growth of a competitor stock price. What does that say about the business challenge that she was facing? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think if you look at Tesla, their investor base doesn’t look like the investors who go into the stocks of the traditional automakers. The autos is not a growth, it’s not been a growth industry for a very long time. So their stocks are assigned values that reflect that. It’s slow, steady, but investors don’t go into a stock like GM looking for a big moonshot bet on self-driving cars and electric cars. That’s a big source of frustration to the CEOs of these companies. For years, auto executives rolled their eyes or dismissed Tesla, didn’t think they’d ever get to be able to mass market cars. They wouldn’t be able to get their factories. Making cars is hard, and it was hard for Tesla. Once they punched through, I think that’s when they came out with a Model 3 around the 2018 timeframe. That was the proof point that I think the industry needed to say, “Okay, these guys are for real, and oh, by the way, their stock value just passed ours.” Then by the time you get to 2020, 2021, Tesla is worth more than the top 10 automakers in the world combined, market cap. So there’s two big reasons why the industry piled into EVs as seemingly suddenly as they did. One was boring. It was regulations around the world, climate change, regulators, politicians were trying to get a handle on that problem. CURT NICKISCH: Just to underline that there, they’re offering tax incentives and things like that for customers who buy EVs. So trying to tilt the economic playing field a little bit in the favor of electric vehicle adoption. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. The regulatory part of the story is more, it’s like carrot and stick. Yes. Incentives to get companies to make EVs and batteries and for consumers to buy them. Also, tougher regulations, right around tailpipe emissions, how much carbon you could emit and other pollutants. So over the years, the companies could meet those regulations through improvements to their gas powered vehicles and diesel vehicles. There were, I think the miles per gallon today is something like double what it was in the late ’70s. So there was tons of improvement in the internal combustion engine, but it got to a point where these regulations have become so tight, especially in Europe and China, that the companies needed to start to electrify. The regulations certainly pushed them in this direction, but the effect of Tesla and other startups, and now the Chinese really I think is what got the attention of the global auto CEO to say, “We’re getting left behind. Investors aren’t paying attention to us. We need to go in this direction.” CURT NICKISCH: You have a really great image, a good leadership lesson here in the book of Ford CEO, Jim Farley, meeting with his engineers and doing a teardown of a Tesla and a Ford electric vehicle side by side. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, Jim Farley, this is early 2022 when they did this exercise, and he’d only been CEO for a little over a year. He had been talking to some of his engineering leaders a few weeks beforehand, and he was pondering this question. He was one of the few auto executives who really was paranoid about Tesla back in the early days. So he’s always been looking over his shoulder at Tesla, and when he got to be CEO, he knew that that was going to be really his biggest nemesis or one of them. So he wanted to get a better handle on how Tesla had become so successful, starting to turn a profit at that point where really none of the traditional automakers were profitable. CURT NICKISCH: In EVs, yeah. MIKE COLIAS: In EVs. Right. So he questioned his engineering leadership. He said, “I don’t know that we’re designing these EVs in the most efficient way. What’s the difference between the way we do it and the way Tesla does it?” According to Jim, he was told that there really isn’t much of a difference. So he ordered up this dissection side by side of a Tesla Model Y and a Ford Mach-E, which had been… It’s an SUV. It’s really cool looking. It had done really well in the market. These teardowns engineers in the auto industry do them all the time; somewhat rare to have a CEO roll up his sleeves and want to get involved. So this empty warehouse in Dearborn near the headquarters, they had these two cars. They picked them apart. And the results were, there was a pile of guts laying on the floor next to the Ford that was a lot bigger than the pile of stuff laying next to the Tesla. There were brackets that didn’t need to be there, and there was something like hundreds of feet of wiring more in the Ford than there was in the Tesla. So it’s just all cost in weight, when weight is a killer when you’re trying to squeeze more miles out of an electric car. So he was upset about this, and the next week he paraded the board through this warehouse to show them this is what we’re up against. If we don’t figure out how to do this and get the cost out and compete with a company that has only been making cars really for five years, and we’ve been doing it for a century, we’re going to lose this. He’s really talked in terms of how this is an existential threat and battle that Ford is under right now. CURT NICKISCH: “Only the paranoid survive,” that was Andy Grove at Intel’s disruptive innovation lesson. What I liked about that story was just how it showed how a company that’s using a technology that leapfrogs you, that was it. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s the innovator’s dilemma, right? Which I’m sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with. This idea that institutionally you almost have this subconscious aversion toward jumping to the thing that is going to be the next big growth area because it requires abandoning what you’ve done and what has worked so well for you for a century. And in this case, some of that inertia of how you design a car. It’s always been with a big engine block up front and a transmission running through the middle to the rear of the car. One of the executives I talk to a lot calls it scar tissue. They haven’t been able to figure out a real great, clean sheet design for electric vehicles, at least not until recently. Now we’re starting to see some of those come out. There’s a lot of great cars out there, but companies like Tesla and the Chinese are just, it’s sort of like you get the feeling they’re on versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, when many of the traditionals are one and 2.0. CURT NICKISCH: One really emblematic episode in your book is just when Tesla lowers its prices. So for a long time you’ve got these established car companies in the U.S., they realize that electrics are where they need to go. They start putting lots and lots of money into it. It’s all about cost. You have to drive those costs down and make it profitable at scale. They’re matching Tesla as a benchmark. And right when they feel like they’re about to put models into the market, Tesla lowers its prices. Can you describe just how meaningful that was and what that meant for these big car makers? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think as you described, it was really this gut punch because this is early, right at the beginning of 2023. Until then, the EV story was really, EVs were taking off and you had people willing to pay above sticker price and on wait lists to get these new models. We were finally getting new cars, new EVs onto the market that weren’t Tesla’s. The other brands had finally gotten into the game and they were still not making money on these EVs. They didn’t have the scale yet. They’re only making a few thousand to start, and it’s still a money losing endeavor, but it was looking bright because the demand seemed to be there. When Musk took the step to weaponize his profit margin is what one executive described it to me, because by that time, Tesla’s profit margins, the company, the auto industry thought would never be able to be profitable, had been way bigger than the rest of the industry. So he had some headroom. He was more profitable than these other companies just on a company-wide basis, let alone the fact that these companies were actually losing money on their EVs and making money on gas power cars. So what he decided to do, and this might not… We don’t know exactly his reasoning. CURT NICKISCH: He said his reasoning was to democratize access to these vehicles. MIKE COLIAS: Right. And that’s a message that he’s had for a long time. He said many times that he started Tesla for environmental reasons and he wanted as many people as they could to drive electric cars. Competition probably played into it too. The other thing that’s super scary, I think for if you’re a CEO of a car company, what Elon Musk now believes is that it doesn’t really matter how much money I make on the initial sale of a car. I’m adding so much software, specifically self-driving software, to the point where if you own a Tesla, you’re going to be able to flip a switch and have it be a robot car and you could rent it out and have it serve as a driverless Uber. That’s going to be five times more valuable than this car company I’ve created. So he’s working on that, and it’s to be determined how soon or if and when that ever happens. The point is for the rest of the industry, if that’s what he believes, and he doesn’t care that much about what he prices his cars at, or if he prices them at a loss, that’s a big problem for the companies who are just scraping to try to turn up any kind of profit on their electric cars. It just completely pulled the rug out from under the rest of the industry. CURT NICKISCH: Meanwhile, I mean, we’re talking about a lot of US-based companies here, but you have Chinese electric vehicle companies driving a lot of innovation. I mean, I heard from somebody recently who said they would prefer some Chinese EV models to Mercedes, that they’re really that good. A lot of those are selling in Europe now, but there are tariffs in the US. You also have this, even for Tesla, you have the possibility of Chinese car makers disrupting Tesla or U.S. ones. MIKE COLIAS: Yes. Elon Musk has been quoted as saying that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive in the world now. It’s a fascinating story. I mean, this was one of the things that I found most surprising, and I had to research the Chinese market more. So a lot of the stuff in my day-to-day job, I just uncovered by covering the industry. I’d been to China a few times, but I didn’t really know the origin story and how they came to be such a juggernaut. I mean, they just made the decision to leap ahead. They knew they weren’t very competitive in internal combustion cars. The big global companies have been doing it for a century. The Chinese industry was young, and it was a conscious decision to invest in electric. Plenty of government money went into incentives for companies to build them and consumers to buy them. They invested heavily in the charger. I think there’s like 20 times more fast chargers in China than there is in the U.S. CURT NICKISCH: When you say they, a lot of this is government funded or government supported infrastructure investment. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. Many, if not most of the Chinese automakers have some level of government ownership. People point out that federal government in the U.S. also provides subsidies and assists EVs. I think in China it’s at a much bigger scale. There’s also other advantages I think that those Chinese companies have been able to bring to bear. The supply chain is more developed, the raw materials for the batteries, cheaper labor. There’s all sorts of factors that have gone into the Chinese being able to make this stuff roughly a 30% less cost and expense that goes into their EVs. At the same time, as you alluded to, they’re really good. Many of them. They’re still cheap and cheerful brands over there. There’s brands that to your point, if you walked into a showroom and put it next to a BMW or a Tesla, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference and you might gravitate toward the Chinese one. I mean, the product is really good. So I don’t know of any auto executive who feels comfortable about with the fact that the governments are going to protect them with tariffs from the Chinese threat of EV makers who are making a lot of cars in China, too many. So now they’re exporting them around the world. So if you’re a CEO sitting in Germany or Detroit or Tokyo, I don’t think you’re going to be comfortable just assuming that those cars are never going to reach your shores. If you make a really good car that’s affordable, consumers eventually are going to demand them. Politicians are going to bend to that will. So I think Mary Barra, Jim Farley, a lot of these CEOs know that, and they know that they’re going to have to compete, even though China has arguably a decade headstart on this transition. CURT NICKISCH: One conclusion that you have in your book, and that’s at the moment that we are now, is that at least in the U.S. market, hybrid vehicles are the entry level electric vehicles for a lot of families still, a lot of drivers, that jumping directly to electric might not happen as quickly as people forecast. MIKE COLIAS: I think for the consumer and for the broader transition, I think that’s probably a good thing to have this bridge technology where people can get a feel for what electrons can do for your driving and your fuel consumption. So there are so many brands now that offer hybrid options across their lineups where you don’t have to plug anything in. It’s a motor and a small battery that sits in the background that actually many of them, it gives you a little more power. They’re more fun to drive, and oh, by the way, you’re getting 30 or 40% better fuel economy. So I think that’s an important part of this transition that a lot of the companies wanted to skip over because you’d rather just go to the end solution and pick one technology and go with that. Certainly GM, that was their strategy was we don’t really think hybrids are necessary. And they probably missed that one. They’ve said they’re going to now go back and offer some hybrids. 20 years ago, if you drove a Prius, it was like a stigma attached to that. Now people don’t think about it. There’s a bigger leap to make from a hybrid to a full electric in a car you need to plug in and monitor your charge and all that. There are bigger habits to change, but I see it playing out the same way where the more you see electric cars, know neighbors who have one get into them, people start to warm up to that idea of plugging in the car. You’re right. I think hybrids are going to be here for a long time. I think it’s another reason why we’re not going to hit, at least in the U.S. a tipping point real soon on the full electric story. CURT NICKISCH: Mike, this has been really interesting. So much at play in this industry, and it was great to hear about it. Thanks for coming on the show. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, thanks so much, Curt.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, our returning champion, Torsten Slack, chief economist at Apollo. You know, most of the economists that you’re probably familiar with haven’t really had a good handle on the state of the economy over the past couple of years. They have been expecting recessions, they’ve expected contractions. They kind of missed the surge in inflation, they missed the collapse in inflation. There aren’t a lot of economists who got it more right than Torsten Slack. Not only has he been appropriately bullish about what’s going on in the economy, why we weren’t really in danger of a recession anytime over the past couple of years. I, I disagree with his forecast for this year, which is 0% chance of recession. Hey, I never put a 0% chance on anything. But still he’s communicating how wrong everybody else is and how right he’s been and why you should be pretty constructive about the state of both employment and credit and the stock market he has. He has absolutely been dead on. And I have to point out what a force of nature he is. He, he’s got a really fascinating background, IMF, OECD, Deutsche Bank, and now on the private buy side with a big emphasis on private sector companies. I don’t know what else to say. I thought this conversation was absolutely fascinating. He was just on such a roll. All I had to do is just kind of give him a little nudge and get outta the way. Really an absolutely tour to force explanation as to why the US and global economy is where it is, where it’s like to continue going and why there are such tailwinds for growth in the US and to a lesser degree Japan. But why the US is so much better situated than Europe or China and most of Asia. I found this to be absolutely fascinating and I think you also, with no further ado, my discussion with Apollo Global managements to in Slack. Torsten Slok: Thanks so much, Barry, and it’s great to be here instead of sitting in a boat fishing in Maine as you and I have done together before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. That’s a mouthful of places where you’ve worked. Before we get into your career, I wanna start with University of Copenhagen and Princeton University. WA was the career plan, always economics and finance. Torsten Slok: Well, I grew up in a small town called Rush Kilder, which is 30 kilometers to the west of Copenhagen. You could see I’m so European still that I speak in kilometers rather than miles. Right. And I studied economics in university. And then when I started doing my PhD, you have to go a year abroad. And I spent a year in Princeton in the economics department in 95, 96 when Ben Panke was the chairman of the economics department. And then when I finished my degree, I applied for a job at the IMF in Washington dc And economics has basically been the bread and butter of my life, at least my adult life for the last 25, 30 years. Barry Ritholtz: I’ve been to Denmark, beautiful country. Beautiful. Copenhagen is absolutely beautiful. I’m curious how different studying economics is in Denmark versus United States. Torsten Slok: Well, obviously all the super universities are here. So from a publishing an academic perspective, it’s really good, but it’s just a, a little bit different in the sense that it is not, of course having the same environment, the same seminars and for that matter, the same people of course that are in the us. But that being said, Europe still has some really incredible universities, including University of Copenhagen. You learn a lot. And as you know, European style, your degree is not an undergraduate degree in four years, it’s a master’s degree where you start out on day one studying economics, theology, humanities. And you do that for five years in a row. So you end up doing five years relatively specialized in this case, in economics for me. And I found it just that the environment, everything that I experienced that went through there and still have many good friends at the university and of course in Copenhagen that I still talk to, to this day about economics and what’s going on in financial markets Barry Ritholtz: And make me a little jealous. Do you pay for college and graduate school or does the state cover that? Torsten Slok: So it happens to be the case in Denmark that tuition is completely free. In fact, you get a stipend, which is three, $4,000 a month. Wow. On top of that, you also get, so this is as a PhD student, you also get, of course I need to say this, free healthcare. And of course all this is subsidized and ultimately paid for by the Danish taxpayers. Right? That’s why marginal tax rates in Denmark are 55%. Right. And not 37% as it is in the us right? Barry Ritholtz: It is better to be middle class or lower class in Denmark. It’s better to be wealthy in the United States. Everyone, at least in terms of net dollars in your pocket, Torsten Slok: Everyone has access to healthcare, everyone has access to free education, and then you just have to do your homework, which is the hard part, and then of course complete your education. But it is absolutely a major difference, of course, to what we had to do. Barry Ritholtz: But you left before you had to pay those 55% tax rates. Well, Torsten Slok: So I just got my free education and then left. So, but I am still both a Danish citizen. I’m also a US citizen, so I’m trying to get the best and make the most of both Worlds. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about your career. You start out as an economist at the IMF, right? OUTTA school. I, I know at a certain point at the IMF, you were the guy writing the world’s economic outlook and you were covering China and Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. Do you start out right outta school doing the global outlook for the IMF or you have to work your way up to that? No, Torsten Slok: You absolutely have to work your way up. But the IMF has this great philosophy that the young people who start in the organization throw them on deep water. And in this case, that means in IMF language that you need to go on a program country. And a program country is a country that normally has some IMF loan or is drawing on some IMF facility. And in my case, I was pulled into working on Mongolia. Wow. So I went to Ulan Baton in January where it was about as cold as it is here in New York City today. Right. And it is quite an experience to come to an emerging market when you are just around 30 years old and you certainly sit there with the Central Bank governor, you sit down with the Minister of Finance and of course there’s a whole team. I was the most junior person. And you try to think about what are the macroeconomic problems for this country? How can we get this country back on track? Under what conditions should they borrow? All those things are a very critical part of the education you get at the IMF. Namely, learning to analyze and understand an economy from a macroeconomic perspective, Barry Ritholtz: That that sounds like it was an amazing experience. Torsten Slok: It was incredible. I had never obviously looked at a thought about Mongolia too much before. So the fact that you suddenly I involved and also the whole process at the IMF, which is very important, you basically have a country that have some macroeconomic problems. Then there is a process of them going to the board of the IMF and the executive board of the IMF then has to discuss under what conditions do we want to give a loan to this country? And that process of giving a loan, in some cases the IMF says, yes, you can have a loan. In other cases the IMF says, no, you cannot have a loan because you’re not willing or able to meet the conditionality that comes with borrowing money from the IMF. And often countries come to the IMF when they’re not able to not able to borrow in public markets. And that’s why the IMF plays this special role of having conditionality having conditions associated with borrowing. That means that you can borrow, but only if you do these things that the global community thinks is a good idea. And in some cases might be politically challenging, but we do this. So try to get you out of this problem that you’re in at the moment. So, Barry Ritholtz: So now let’s compare and contrast. You go from there, the OECD in Paris. What’s it like being an economist in Paris? Yeah, Torsten Slok: So the IMF has money and gives a loan to countries, whereas the OECD is really just a think tank. It used to be really mainly more wealthy countries, meaning developed markets meaning the G seven plus a few others. But now it has broadened out a bit more to also have Brazil, Chile, other countries that you would normally categorize as emerging markets. But the OECD basically is an organization in Paris that lays out best practice across countries. So as a government, you think constantly about what is best practice for healthcare policies, for pension policies, for all kinds of other policies when it comes to climate change, when it comes to really all areas of policy making. And the idea is to get together in Paris for the OECD countries to come and say, what experiences have you made when you put together a pension system? What experiences have we made? And the IMF then writes a report and says, these are the ways that people have done it, that work. And other, sometimes they say, other examples are, this is where it has not worked very well to try for you and me and the US and Denmark and all other countries in the world to have an example of how should we design our pension system? How do we make sure that there are enough retirement savings for our population? How has it been done in other countries? So it’s really an organization that really is a think tank, but it really is a best practice think tank where you get experiences and you get practices from other countries that then can be used again in in the countries that are participating. Huh, Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. So the biggest chunk of your career was at Deutsche Bank. Did you start in in Germany or did you start here in New York? So Torsten Slok: I started here in New York because some of my former colleagues from the IMF had moved to Deutsche Bank, David before Golan and Pinky Charter. And they called and asked if I wanted to come to the US and work here with them. And this was in 2005. It was not our plan. My wonderful wife Julie and I had our first son and his name is Fleming. And it was a 2003 and we lived in Paris. We all enjoyed it. We were actually trying to get a bit closer to Copenhagen, but then out of the blue pinky called and said, Hey, would you like to come to New York and work with us? And my experience from the IMF and the OECD and then this opportunity to be in Deutsche Bank with some friends and colleagues that I had known for many years and who are still my really good friends today, of course meant that I said, well, why don’t we try this? And Julie was up for it. So we moved our family over here from Paris in 2005. Barry Ritholtz: So brief digression, I don’t know who Binky is personally, I’ve never met him. I cannot begin to tell you how many people have referenced him as a mentor, as an influence as this is a person who just had such a big impact in the world of finance. We’ll get to the mentor questions later. I’m just curious how outsized a personality is is binky. Yeah. Torsten Slok: So a very important part of your question also here is that it is absolutely critical to remember that inside organizations such as the IMF and the OECD, you establish long-term relationships with people that really almost in, in a lot of cases, basically last for almost your whole career or your whole life. So that means you built strong connections with people, you work with them in stress situations, in less stress situations, in good and bad times. And I had worked with Binky, not directly under him and also David Lan, but they were both of course, very important employees at the IMF. And when they decided to move to Deutche Bank, I decided to say, well, I know these people really well. And binky indeed, even today, as you know, he’s still the chief equity strategist at the Deutsche Bank. He has some incredible frameworks and I have learned a lot from him. We’ll talk more about this later in terms of you need to have a framework when you talk about things. And he was the first one and still is to this day is telling me you need to have a framework. What is the framework why you are thinking the stock market will go up or the dollar will go down or the fed will high rates. All these things came from a discussion from Pinky and David and several others. And who by the way, also have a PhD in economics because they were the ones who got me into de bank starting in 2005. Barry Ritholtz: So you spent 15 years at Deutsche Bank. That’s the biggest part of your career on the sell side. I’m curious, how do you curate a firm view? How do you develop, Hey, this is the perspective of Deutsche Bank, you, US which is a giant entity? Well, Torsten Slok: As you and I have been talking about for many years, different banks have different strategies. So some banks have a house view, other banks have a house of views. So that means that in this case, Deutsche Bank was run in a way. And I think that does make sense where there was no strong house view every day on everything because we have to let individuals free in the sense that the different people have different types of expertise in different areas. So at DB we would sit down around the table, think about the Federal Reserve or the ECP or the Bank of Japan, and we would then say, okay, whoever was the main person responsible for that central bank, what is your view? Let’s discuss, do we all agree with this? What are the arguments why this is right? What are the arguments why this is wrong? This gives a healthy debate, this gives a healthy way of saying, we have now turned every stone and we end up where we publish the view that, let’s say that the Fed, for example, today, we’ll talk about this later, will be keeping interest rates on hold. But that discussion, of course, is a very important part of the debate. Instead of just having, well, I am having someone in the organization who says, oh, the Fed will not do anything, but everyone else can then sit around and say, oh, I disagree with that view. I think the view should be different. So there is no easy solution to this problem, but it is the case that at Deutsche, it used to be the situation where we would sit around the table and fight it out and end up with a view on what do we think is the outlook for, in this case, the Fed DCB or the Bank of Japan or any other central bank or any other market we were looking at. Huh, Barry Ritholtz: Really, really interesting. So you’re at a government entity, then you’re at a think tank, then you’re at a sell side brokerage firm, then you end up at Apollo, which not only is buy side, but it’s more focused on the private markets than the public markets. I’m curious, what led you to Apollo and what was that transition like? Yeah, Torsten Slok: So at Deutsche Bank I spent essentially all my time on going to clients with sales. So we would go to pimco, BlackRock, Brevin, Howard, all the hedge funds, all the real money managers. And we would sit down and talk about what is the outlook for rates, equities, commodities, everything in the macro world that they wanted to discuss. At Apollo, my job is quite different and it has some different elements that I didn’t have in my job with Deutsche Bank. So what was the attraction was that after 15 years of traveling around the world and talking about the macro in client meetings, really anywhere you could go where anyone was interested in the US economic outlook at Apollo, I spent roughly half of my time still doing that on the fundraising side. But the other half of my time I spend internally talking to deal teams. A deal team is looking at buying a company, a deal team is looking at giving a loan to a company. This could be in the us, it could be in Europe, it could be in anywhere in the world, Brazil. It could be really any type of financing that we would be studying carefully. And in some of these cases, macroeconomics is less important. In other cases, macroeconomics is really important. Meaning we begin to discuss what is the outlook for rates? Meaning what are the financing costs, what’s the outlook for spreads, what’s the outlook for even wages, what’s the outlook for low income wages, middle income wages, high income wages, what is the outlook for the dollar? And we also have discussions of what is the outlook for politics. So those things are not things that we can control, but they nevertheless turn out to be really important if you want to understand the risks associated with the investment that you’re doing. What attracted me to come to Apollo was I still am doing to a last degree. Many of the things, again, half of my job is traveling around the world talking to people about the macroeconomic outlook. But the internal part of talking to deal teams and for that matter also talking to management about what’s going on, what are we seeing, what are we hearing? And we have 50, a little less than 50 portfolio companies talking to the CEOs of these portfolio companies. It all gives a very corporate finance addition to my macroeconomic thinking. And that was and continues to be the main significant attraction that I find so exciting about my job naming that is combining the macro world with the corporate finance and the deal team world in private credit and private equity. And then trying to come up with a view, what do we think will happen going forward. Barry Ritholtz: Now at Deutsche Bank, you were a fairly traditional economic publisher. When you moved to Apollo, you developed several new platforms, new content platforms. I think everybody who’s listening is probably familiar with the Daily Spark, which is sort of your chart of the day, which is always fascinating and niche and chockfull of information. But you also put out full research decks and full the traditional economic data series. But then on top of that is the Apollo Academy. Tell us a little bit about that. Torsten Slok: Yeah, so the idea with the Apollo Academy is there are really several different purposes. So first of all, Apollo Academy is really the prime place to go if you want to understand alternatives because it is often of course the case that people in financial markets, everyone spends so much time on s and p 500, right? Because s and p 500 is what we all discuss all day long. But if you look at businesses with employment in the US, there are 6 million firms in the US that have employment. So the fact that we spend time on 500 companies out of 6 million businesses, it just doesn’t make too much sense. So that’s why private markets and what’s going on in private markets, both in private equity and also in of course in private credit is a very important part of the US and the global economy. So that’s what we try to do in Apollo Academy, namely have various educational materials. White paper was about private credit, white paper was about private equity. White paper was about asset backed finance. White paper was about all kinds of aspects of what our private markets today. And what we also do on the apollo academy.com homepage is of course that we also produce, as you just mentioned, a daily spark email, which is a chart that we produce every day, which is some interesting topic that we are thinking about. And we also try to have, by the way, we also have podcast and we also have videos, but we try to generally have material so that people and the public out there can be informed about what’s going on in alternatives and in private markets at the moment. Barry Ritholtz: I just want to talk briefly about the daily spark, ’cause I’m fascinated both on the subjects that you focus on and the process you use in creating it. Something recently that showed up New York Hotel costs, now that seems so specific. What do New York Hotel costs tell us about the broader economy? Torsten Slok: We, this is a really good question and you’re not the only one to probably think about that. Among the listeners. Many for those who do subscribe to the Daily Spark are probably scratching their heads sometimes and saying, why are we even talking about this? We also have data sometimes that will look at for how many people are visiting the Statue of Liberty, right? We also look at how many people go to Broadway shows. Barry Ritholtz: I remember seeing that… Torsten Slok: You and I laugh at it sometimes and you should also laugh at it sometimes and say, why? Why are we looking at this? But in fact, it is still the case that if you think about it, well hotel costs are important for a number of different reasons. Not only from a commercial estate investing perspective, but it’s also important to get some understanding of how expensive is it. Now, the average price for staying at a hotel at the moment in New York City is more than $400. That is really expensive. Think about also how much that has gone up, how much of that has gone up after Covid. That has implications for how you think about what is occupancy rates for hotels, not only in New York, but nationwide. That has implications for how well is the consumer doing that has implications for tourism. It has just so many ramifications. A lot of these things, even how many people go to Broadway shows also tells you something about is there a willingness among consumers to spend on discretionary spending something that’s a little bit expensive. The average Broadway show ticket cost around around $150. And Barry Ritholtz: That’s a bargain right there at Buck 50. Torsten Slok: It could be a lot more expensive than that, right? And all that to your question is you say, well, why are we looking at this? So without writing a long, long, 30 page paper with 30 footnotes, just a simple chart saying, Hey, check this out. This is something we are thinking about. You can say, oh, I don’t really care about this. Why should I worry about how many people, again, go to Broadway shows or how many people go to the Statue of Liberty? Or what is the cost of staying overnight at a hotel? But it still is something that at least is one dimension to thinking about a lot of the different things that are going on. And that is the benefit. And that’s what I’m enjoying so much of producing one every day because then I, I write about something today and tomorrow I can write about something else. And, Barry Ritholtz: The fact that you do something completely different every day, someone may say, who cares how many people go to the Statue of Liberty? But when you see 90 different charts over the course of three or four months, it starts to paint a broader picture as to what’s going on. All these little niche data points they add up. And it gives you a perspective on the economy that you may not get looking at GDP or unemployment Torsten Slok: As as when you and I always talk about what is the economic outlook, and then you can start in some corner, but I still need to paint you a picture, a mosaic that ultimately has some different pieces. And these charts are exactly meant to be different pieces in what is going on in the economy and more broadly, what is it in financial markets that we should be talking about And that’s relevant. And sometimes some of these pieces in the mosaic may look insignificant and not very critical. But in other times, a chart could simply also be, what’s the trend in inflation? Should we expect inflation to go up now that Trump has been talking about tariffs, now that we may have restrictions on immigration now that we may lower corporate tax rates on domestic manufacturers to 15%, could that be a reason why there might be some lift in some of the more important indicators other than of course some of the more funny indicators that we’ve been talking about up to this point we Barry Ritholtz: Were talking earlier at, at the mosaic of different data points that create an economic outlook. Let’s talk first about the US and then the rest of the world. You’ve described the US economy as quote firing on all cylinders discuss. Torsten Slok: So the backdrop for where we sit today is of course that GDP growth for the last two and a half years since the Fed began to raise interest rates has been remarkably strong. And this has raised a number of important questions in financial markets. Namely when the Fed raised interest rates, I would have expected and the textbook would have expected that home prices should have been going down. That’s not what has happened. You would’ve expected that when interest rates go up, car sales should go down. That is not what has happened. And you would also have expected that when interest rates go up, that CapEx spending and business spending by businesses should also be slowing down. And that is not what has happened. And why is it that the economy has continued to be so strong? In other words, what happened to long and variable lags that the Federal Reserve FOMC members have talked about for so long? Why didn’t the economy slow down when interest rates went up? And there are three very important reasons why that didn’t happen. First of all, we have had a much less interest rate sensitive economy this time around than we’ve had before. Most importantly, 95% of mortgages outstanding in the US are 30 year fixed rate. And that means that when interest rates started going up, that meant that mortgage payments did not go up for consumers because consumers had locked in low interest rates during the pandemic. And this was also the case for corporate debt. Net interest payments as a share of operating surplus in the US has been going down despite that the Fed has been raising interest rates. So there was also less interest rates sensitivity for corporates. So taken together the first argument, why is the economy still so strong? Because Fed hikes simply did not have a particularly negative impact on consumers and on firms as the textbook would have predicted. Secondly, in the US we also have a data center. Boom, we have an AI and data center boom. Unlike what we see in any other countries, there’s 6,000 data centers in the US more than all other country countries combined in the world. So data center boom has probably been adding around 0.2% to GDP DP growth wow, for the last several years. And third, and finally, we also have fiscal policy even before we talk about Trump chips act, the inflation act, the infrastructure act have also been important tailwinds. So in summary, and sorry for giving a very long answer, but why is it no good answer. The economy has been so strong. It has to do with less interest rate sensitivity, a data center and AI boom, and finally also fiscal policy. And that’s the reason why even where we sit today, the Atlanta Fed GDP now estimate for Q4 is still at 3% well above the CBOs 2% estimate for long run GDP growth. And that is the reason why the s and p five hundreds have done so well the last few years. That’s the reason why credit spreads on IG higher than loans are so tight because we never got that slowdown that everyone worried so much about. And now we can then start talking about if we add Trump policies on top of this starting point, then you can begin to worry about that maybe there’s a rate acceleration both in inflation and in GDP in 2025 as a result of the starting point being just so strong at the moment. Barry Ritholtz: So there’s a couple of things you didn’t mention in contributing to the strength of of the US economy as well as some price support. And I wanna throw those at you. So you didn’t mention the massive fiscal spend during the Pandemic of CARES Act one and two under President Trump and CARES Act three under President Biden. Those were enormous. Is that pig through the Python? Are we still feeling the effect of that? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so those were also very important reasons why specifically the savings rate went up a lot in the household sector. So excess savings, you and I have been emailing these charts back and forth. Excess savings were really high exactly because of those fiscal policies giving a lot of money to households. And as households were running down those excess savings, this was also a very important tailwind to the outlook. So I do agree that those things have also played a very critical role in why the economic data has continued to be so strong. Even the last non-farm payrolls number we got was of course also very strong. And also, again, telling you that there are some tailwinds and that pick through the Python has played a critical role in keeping the economy strong for a much longer period than what your economics textbook would have predicted. Torsten Slok: So there’s, there’s so many different questions I wanna throw at you from that. You mentioned cars, you mentioned labor and you mentioned houses. All three of those sectors have a shortfall of supply. We stopped making cars for a couple years during the pandemic. So now we’ve ramped up enough new car production still means we have a shortfall of of pre-owned cars, housing, we underbuilt for a decade. There just doesn’t. And the the number of homes for sale close to record lows. And it feels like the labor pool is as tight as it’s ever been in our lifetimes. How significant are these supply issues to both growth and and pricing? Torsten Slok: They are very important. And there is this, as you and I also have talked about before, this academic debate about was inflation high because of supply or was it high because of demand? But exactly as you are outlining, it’s a much more complicated situation where you both have supply constraints for housing, for labor across the board in autos in many other sectors. Because during the pandemic we were simply not able to produce enough of what was needed for the economy to go at full capacity. So therefore we did have a decline in supply and at the same time we had a significant increase in demand, including from the fiscal policies that you just mentioned. And those things together were a very important reason why inflation went up. So now you are asking, looking into 2025, are these things still here? I would say they are still here to a very significant degree. And even before we’ve talked about Trump policies and tariffs and restrictions on immigration and lower corporate taxes. All these things are still pointing in my view to a situation where we are not out of the woods on inflation. The risk is that inflation could begin to see some lift simply because the Fed is now cutting and we still have tailwinds from fiscal policy, ai data center spending. We also have tailwinds from energy transition. And by the way, what we haven’t talked about either, we also have tailwinds from defense spending and we also of course have tailwinds from fiscal policy, the CHIPS act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure act, and taken together all these things. Do point to your question, name me that there is still a chance that we might see inflation go up and therefore we might see the Fed potentially raise interest rates in 2025. So Barry Ritholtz: You’ve been very constructive on the economy for the past two years. A lot of economists were expecting a recession in 22, 23, 24. They haven’t gotten the recession they’ve been expecting. Why do you think the consensus was so wrong? Is it just that’s what the textbook said Torsten Slok: Exactly. I think we’ve been waiting for Gau for a long time and Gau basically has not arrived. And I don’t think he will arrive, at least not in 2025 because I think everyone took that textbook out exactly as you just said, Barry, and said, wow, when the Fed raises interest rates, then the probability of recession goes up. You actually see that on your Bloomberg screen. If you type ECFC, go and look in the upper right hand corner, you can see that the probability of recession immediately. When the Fed began to raise interest rates in March of 2022, the consensus began to lift higher significantly the probability of recession. And it was telling you that all the economists on the street who were looking at what is the implication if the Fed raises interest rates, they were saying it will absolutely be a recession. And what in my view was at least is clear today. And what’s the reason why we didn’t get it was because we all underestimated fiscal policy. We underestimated the excess savings, meaning the money that you just mentioned came into people’s bank accounts. And we also underestimated the interest rate insensitivity of the data center boom and also the interest rate insensitivity of energy transition and also the interest rate insensitivity of the fiscal policy from the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Auction Act. And those tailwinds have just kept the economy a lot stronger. So people underestimated that it was not just about interest rates going up, there were tailwinds that kept the economy afloat and a lot stronger than what really almost everyone expected. So Barry Ritholtz: In 2024, the Fed finally talking about waiting for Godot finally began cutting interest rates. You are one of the few economists who came out and said, Hey, the US economy is strong enough, we really don’t need rate cuts. Explain your thinking. Torsten Slok: Yeah. So we said, and we were wrong in the beginning of last year that the Fed would not cut rates in 2024, they did cut rates now a hundred basis points, it is still being debated. I know this sounds very academic, whether that was actually a good idea or not, but it is clear that the Fed did end up cutting interest rates with the main argument that inflation in June of 2022 was 9% and it had come down to around 3%. So the Fed concluded three years closer to our target of two. So this allows us to begin to cut interest rates. The problem is where we sit right now here, of course at the beginning of 2025, that well in the last few months, inflation has proven more sticky. The median CPI measure from the Cleveland Fed, the trim mean the various measures of acyclical, infl, inflation, and of course also various measures from the inflation from the the New York Fed that also looks at trends in underlying the UIP measure are saying that inflation is beginning to move more sideways and some indicators X beginning to move up. So again, even before we have spoken about Trump policies potentially giving a lift to even as if it’s modest lift to inflation, the problem is that inflation today is three and three is not two. And if I start at three and I begin to add a risk of a strong economy and I add a risk of both tariffs and restrictions on immigration, the risk is not that inflation goes down to two, but the risk is that three begins to become higher. So that’s why we still are in the camp of thinking that well, maybe we are still a little bit early in declaring victory over this issue on hey, inflation is no longer a problem because maybe inflation could come back in 2025 and we just don’t quite yet have it completely under control. And that’s what FMC members have been saying and speeches namely that, well, maybe we need to go a little bit more slowly and maybe we should even just take a pause and take a break and see, well, how long time will it take before inflation begins to show more signs of it actually continuously moving lower? Barry Ritholtz: Well, in the last presser, it’s pretty clear Jerome Powell wants to take a break, but it raises the question if all this is true about the strength of the US economy, and I completely agree with you, I I’ve been trying to figure out what is their thinking, why would they cut? And I kind of came up with two theories and I wanna bounce ’em off you. One is the bottom half of the economy really is feeling the effects of higher credit, whether it’s credit cards, automobile loans say nothing of new mortgage rates, and then second related to mortgage rates. So many people have locked in low rates, it’s almost a, a set of golden handcuffs and they’re stuck to that house that they can’t move out of because the financing costs of a newer house, a larger house or wherever they wanna move is just so much greater than where they are. All the supply is frozen in place remotely close or what do you think? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so the argument that the Fed or the FMC laid out for why they were cutting interest rates was simply that inflation had come down and their goal at the Federal Reserve is the dual mandate given by Congress. Namely they need to have inflation at 2% and they need to have full employment. And given inflation was closer to 2%, 3% is closer to two than nine is to two. They were saying we can begin to cut interest rates. But it’s absolutely clear what you’re saying that it was definitely the case and continues to be the case that who is it that is impacted when interest rates are high? It is people and balance sheets with a lot of debt. That is both the case in credit, meaning for firms, but that is also the case for households. Households that have a lot of debt are more vulnerable when interest rates are high. And who are the households, as you were just saying, who have more debt? That is by definition young households because when you’re young, you have more debt on your credit card, on your order loan, on your student loan on your mortgage. So if interest rates are higher for longer, it by definition has a more negative impact on lower income and younger households because when you’re young, you’re generally also lower income. So it is the reality, it’s not very comfortable for the Fed to talk about it this way, but it is with reality that fed policy has distributional consequences. It hurts those who have debt and it helps those who have assets. And that’s exactly the distribution across the income distribution across age, across FICO scores. Name me that if you are a low income low FCO and younger household, you have been hit harder by interest rates being higher. So that’s why when interest rates started to go down, that would likely not that this was the goal, but that would likely then be helping these households that have been harder hit and more negatively impacted by high interest rates. Barry Ritholtz: So we look at the inflation rate in the United States hanging around two and a half percent, little under three, whether it depends on whether you’re looking at CPI or CORE or PCE or whatever. Yep. But you look around the rest of the world X US, it’s like four point a half percent. Why does the rest of the world have so much higher of an inflation rate than we do here in the United States? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so one important answer to that is that Europe is unfortunately not in a particularly good situation relative to the us Europe is having the challenge that China is slowing down. Remember, China is slowing down for three reasons, slowing down because of demographic problems. Remember the workforce in China is about a billion people. And the United Nations is forecasting that over the next 10 years that will shrink from a billion to 900 million. That means that we are removing a hundred million people. Wow. In the Chinese workforce over the next decade, meaning a hundred million people, fewer working in the service sector, in the manufacturing sector, a hundred million people, fewer paying taxes, a hundred million people, fewer demanding housing and at different housing needs. All those things are a Japanese style headwind to Chinese growth overall, China is also having a deflating housing bubble. Existing home prices are falling 9% new home prices are falling 6%. And finally China is also engaged in a trade war not only with us but also with Europe. So because of the headwinds to China, we also have some headwinds, therefore to Germany in particular, but Europe, because Europe produces a lot of the assembly line in China. And if we don’t have that demand from China for assembly lines and for manufacturing goods and for capital intensive goods, that means that Europe is also in trouble. So the problem which you asked about is Germany, and therefore the European economy is not in a good place either. And the challenge now is that the service sector inflation in Europe is driven a lot by wage inflation because a lot of wages are basically directly spilling over and the service sector and therefore that’s how it’s measured when you measure inflation in services. And the conclusion is because of trade unions and while wage negotiations and bargainings being delayed, we still to this day have wage negotiations that are a function of what were in what inflation numbers for the last several years. And looking back, inflation was high. So that’s why with the delay, wage inflation is also high and therefore with the delay service sector inflation is also high. So it’s just because of some institutional reasons. Europe just has a different wage and price dynamic because of this delay in wage negotiations. And that is keeping inflation rates more elevated, especially in services inflation in Europe relative to what we are having in the US Now, Barry Ritholtz: I know the 30 year fixed mortgage is is you know, beloved here in the us most of Europe it’s, it’s a variable inflation, it’s a variable rate. How does that variable rate impact inflation in in Europe and how significant is that to their overall equivalent of CPI? Torsten Slok: And this is really, really important. I mean, as we spoke about earlier, I started my lovely career at the IMF and OECD and at the IMF and OED. Your job is actually quite simple. If the US is good, Europe is good, if the US is bad, Europe is bad. But this is not the case today. And exactly what you’re saying is a very important reason, namely that the interest rate sensitivity of the US economy is a lot lower simply because people have locked in interest rates. Whereas think about literally, as you mentioned, all other OECD countries in the uk, in France or Australia, Canada take the Bank of England, when interest rates go up, mortgage payments for households go up immediately. So that means that monetary policy has a much more immediate negative impact on the European and in this case, the UK economy than it does in the US simply because exactly the mortgage market is much more a function of short, short-term interest rates, the long-term interest rates. And why is that the case? That’s the case because in the US and you wrote a book about this many years ago, we have decided that for Fannie and Freddie, for you to get a conventional mortgage, you must show up at their doorstep with a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. You cannot show up with any other mortgage, then the government will not guarantee it. If you show up with that, they will guarantee it. So that means that the mortgage market is 95% of mortgages outstanding, a third year fixed. And that is simply not the case basically in any other OECD country. And that means the US has this unique feature that central bank or fed policy simply has less of an impact. It’s simply less potent relative to what you see, especially in Europe, but also again uk, Australia, Canada, and the rest of the OSD countries. Barry Ritholtz: You also dropped a data point that I have to follow up the billion to 900 million shift in in workers over the next decade. Essentially you’re saying China is losing a million workers a month for the next decade. Imagine, imagine if nine non-farm payroll came out each month and it was negative 850,000 people. That’s just an astonishing data point. Torsten Slok: And that Is exactly because of the one child policy that of course is beginning to catch up with the Chinese economy. So if you think about the consequences of the one child policy is of course that if you have a smaller population, the population will begin to shrink. And the consequence of course is that, that you will get really what I would describe as Japanese style headwinds from a demographic perspective, similar to what we have seen in Japan now for many decades. Barry Ritholtz: So we have a soft China, although Japan seems to be getting out of its own way and and doing pretty well. Yes, Europe is kind of struggling. The rest of the emerging market world seems to be doing okay outside of hotspots where there, where there are problems, how do you get to a 2.3% GDP in the US given all that challenging data points around the rest of the world. World? Yeah. Torsten Slok: So there are some very important aspects of this naming. The US is actually, and I know this sounds a little bit academic, but the US is actually the only economy in the world that’s a closed economy. And what I mean by that is that that’s an economy that does not depend too much on the rest of the world. You always talk about in the literature, in economics about the small open economy. So Denmark is a small open economy. Australia is a small open economy. Canada is actually also a small open economy because they depend on others. But the US really doesn’t depend to the same degree on others the way, the way that others depend on the us. And why is that important here? That’s very important because if we take the three reasons we talk about earlier, why the US is doing so well, less interest rate sensitivity, we have an AI and data center, boom, we have strong fiscal policies. 00:42:16 These are all things that we simply don’t have in other countries. Instead we have some significant headwinds to growth in other countries. So that means that at the aggregate level, the US continues to do well for some very idiosyncratic tailwinds and Europe and the rest of the world is not doing well from actually some different idiosyncratic headwinds. And now finally for markets, why is this important? Because if you think about it for the s and p 500, suddenly this becomes relevant what’s going on in the rest of the world because the s and p 500 is not the US GDP 40% of revenue and s and p 500 comes from abroad. So if apple sells fewer iPhones in Canada, in Europe, in Australia, that will have implications for apple’s earnings. Likewise, s and p 500 companies that sell things abroad. If the rest of the world is bad, that could be one way that this could begin to have negative consequences for the s and p 500. That’s not my baseline forecast, but I am getting more and more worried about this divergence with the US doing good and everyone else doing poorly. The consequence of that could be that that could ultimately show up in earnings because the s and p 500 is to a very significant degree against 40% of of of revenue in the s and p 500 comes from abroad. And if the abroad is not doing well, then the revenues from abroad will also begin to have a negative impact on earnings for s and p. 00:43:32 [Speaker Changed] Last international question before we jump to the new Trump administration. It’s kind of fascinating. Japan couldn’t get out of its own way for decades. Their market had peaked in 1989, took almost 30 years to to set new highs more more than 30 years. Why did Japan suddenly start performing not just the stock market but their economy Suddenly it looks like Japan is number two to the US and everybody else’s a distant third? Yeah, 00:44:05 [Speaker Changed] There are three reasons why Japan is doing so well at the moment. Number one is that the exchange rate has depreciated a lot and Japan is an exporting economy. It is again, a small open economy that is definitely experiencing a tailwind to economic growth from exports moving higher simply because of the depreciation in the exchange rate. The second reason is also that in Japan there’s actually been some quite fundamental changes in governance. There have been been some quite fundamental changes in the policy setup in terms of how at least the government talks about corporates and how they talk about finance. There is an increased willingness in Japan to give more support to basically people coming and buying companies, lending to companies. So that’s why private equity, private credit has been busy in Japan simply because it’s been getting a lot of policy support from politicians that want to change the governance in Japanese companies. 00:45:01 And third and finally, Japan is actually also, and this might sound a little bit peculiar, but they’re actually benefiting from some of the problems in China now that suddenly Japan is becoming, of course still a big manufacturing nation, but also now a place where more investment is taking place now that there have been these renewed worries about the outlook for China. So the short answer to your question is the exchange rate is supporting the Japanese economic outlook, changes in governance and changes in corporate finance. And the political support for activist investors has also been supportive for the Japanese outlook and for Japanese financial markets. And finally, Japan has also been benefiting for geopolitical reasons for the tailwinds coming because of some of the challenges that we are seeing in China at the moment. Huh, 00:45:44 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. So we were talking about the state of the global economy, now we have a brand new president. Let’s start out just discussing how lucky this guy is to inherit for the second time an economy that to use your words, is firing on all cylinders. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, the economy is actually in great shape today. We have an unemployment rate of 4.1%. GDP growth has for the last several quarters been around 3%. And that’s also what the Atlanta Fed GDP estimate now is for the fourth quarter. So the starting point is a fairly strong economy. The only little macroeconomic thing you can worry about is what we have talked about, namely inflation is still a little bit too high around 3% on CPI when it comes to both core and headline. And that’s of course the challenge here, namely an already strong economy and a little bit too elevated inflation. That’s the starting point for where we sit today. 00:46:41 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna talk about taxes and regulation and tariffs, but before we get there, I know President Trump focuses on the stock market to a lesser degree of the bond market. How do you think about valuations for both equities and fixed income here in the beginning of 2025? Well, 00:47:01 [Speaker Changed] If you, there are various ways of looking at that, but one simple way of looking at that is to go back and look at the sheer cyclically adjusted PE ratio. And this sheer cyclically adjusted PE ratio is basically, as you know too well, a complicated way of saying let’s try to take the business cycle out of earnings by taking a 10 year average of earnings for the last 10 years and ask the question, where is the stock market? Where is this in P 500 relative to a 10 year moving average of earnings? And the answer to that is that the Sheila cyclically adjusted PE ratio, which is an attempt to try to correct the stock market valuations for the business cycle, is currently at a very elevated 37. That means, remember in the long run the PE ratio for the s and p 500 is 16 over the last 50 years. So Sheila Cyclically adjusted so-called cape ratio at 37 is and 38 and approaching 40 is indeed a very, very elevated level of valuation. 00:47:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let me ask you two questions about that. First, we’re we’re not that far apart in age for most of our careers. Cape has been elevated almost the entire time. If you were not in equities because of an elevated cape, well you missed a hell of a move. 00:48:15 [Speaker Changed] It just happens to be the case that with the Trump presidency, this is the highest level of Cape at the start of any presidency going back in the last 50 years, huh? So that means that we are starting at an extremely elevated level of valuations, at least on this Sheila cyclically adjusted level. So let’s now turn to other things that are going on in the stock market. As you know, much better than me, 40% of this and P 500 is the top 10 stocks. You also know that most of the returns have been coming from really the Nvidia having great performance. And we also know very well that of course if you have such a high concentration of the magnificent seven and the top 10 biggest stocks in your index, this goes completely against page one. In my finance textbook, page one in my finance textbook says, you must diversify and if you take a hundred fresh dollars and put into this and P 500 today, you are not diversified. 00:49:03 You are basically betting on Nvidia, still having good earnings. And I love sitting there on a Wednesday afternoon looking at whether Nvidia earnings were good or were bad. And I love the adrenaline rush that comes with investing in Nvidia and a lot of other magnificent seven stocks. But the conclusion still is the same that, well, if I’m saving money for the the long run and I’m trying to do capital preservations, do I wanna expose myself to the risk that I will basically be putting all my money on red, namely on Nvidia and for that matter Tesla and the other names that are in the Magnificent seven still doing well, that could be that they will do well. There are also some arguments why they will not do well, but they’re certainly very expensive. And that’s an argument in my view for definitely being more diversified rather than just having exposure in s and p 500, mainly to those major names that have gotten so much attention. 00:49:50 [Speaker Changed] So could we make that same argument for, for a long time it was Intel and then it was Cisco and it seems like every decade you have this concentration at the top, but since the s and p 500 is market cap weighted, when and, and at one point in time, 25 years ago Cisco was the biggest stock in the s and p 500 and the NASDAQ 100, doesn’t it sort of automatically adjust as, as the company shrinks, you own less of it in, in the index and it, I, I don’t know if self-correcting is the right word, but it seems that you buy the whole basket, you’ll have the Nvidia along with a whole lot of other dogs. 00:50:28 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. I, I do think that’s absolutely correct, but that’s why where we’re sitting today, if we agree, and listeners don’t have to agree with this, but let’s say that at least some people think that the magnificent seven are very, very expensive. The trailing PE ratio for Tesla is 180. The trailing PE ratio for NVIDIA is like 60. The trailing PE ratio for Amazon is like 45. Remember again, the PE ratio has historically on average in the last 50 years, been 16. So if it is the case that these companies are expensive, I think that a more intelligent approach in my opinion would be to say we’re probably going to see some of these companies actually begin to fade and other companies begin to come in. It’s a hard issue to pick which ones it is, but maybe at least in this situation, let’s agree that maybe it may be a better strategy at least to buy the s and p 493 because at least I’m not exposed to those seven stocks that are so expensive. But 00:51:18 [Speaker Changed] By the equal weight and by the equal weight. That way you’re not 00:51:22 [Speaker Changed] Alternative. Yeah. So in that sense, I of course here, and I understand what you’re saying and I do know that the returns in the last two years have been coming to a very last degree from those specific stocks. But all I’m saying is that if we all agree that this is the case, why not take the consequence and then alternative you can, if you have to be in public equities, you could buy this and P 400, which is a way to have exposure not to the small cap companies. Remember in the Russell 2040% of companies have no earnings, right? So if interest rates are higher for longer and you have no earnings, that means that your coverage ratios are low. That means of course, that therefore you’re going to struggle more if interest rates aren’t indeed higher for longer. So I don’t like large cap because I think they’re so expensive. I don’t like small cap because I think they have no earnings. That’s why I think value stocks of companies in the middle, both in public and private space, but in this case, if you have to be in public, s and p 400 will be probably doing, at least in my reading, a better job relative to the other parts of the spectrum. So, 00:52:15 [Speaker Changed] So we hear during inauguration week, let’s talk a little bit about the new administration. Probably the we, we can’t go anywhere without starting with tariffs. How do you feel our trading partners are gonna respond to Trump’s tariffs? Is this, is he serious about this? Is this a negotiating tactic? How do you put this into your intellectual framework? 00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] So the tax foundation has quantified that if Trump does do 60% on China, 25% on Canada, 25% on Mexico, and 10% on Europe, we will get an overall level of tariffs that will go up to 18%, which is the same level that we had in the 1930s when we had trade wars and the economy was not doing very well. So if you do have a complete all in on all fronts when it comes to tariffs, then of course we should begin to worry about that. If everything we buy, you and me in stores goes up, quote unquote by 60% because now there’s 60% tariffs on China, then a good guess is that that means that sales by stores in the US is going to go down. And if sales start to go down, that means that GDP will also be at risk of going down. 00:53:23 So that’s why tariffs of course comes by definition with a stagflationary risk that you raise prices and you lower sales. So with that in mind, that doesn’t mean that we will not get tariffs. It doesn’t mean that we’ll get all in tariffs. No one really knows exactly how much we will get. But we do know that a very important aspect of this is that we also don’t know how the retaliation will be exactly as you’re highlighting from other countries. So that’s why tariffs overall and remains. We didn’t get any executive orders on tariffs other than saying that we will investigate it here, but we didn’t get any executive orders on tariffs on day one. So we’ll see how far we go and what will happen. But at this point, it’s very clear that if tariffs are imposed, it is something that the textbook would tell you that it would involve higher inflation and at the same time, downward pressure on GDP. 00:54:09 [Speaker Changed] And just to clarify that plus 60%, that’s not your forecast as to what’s gonna happen that’s hey, if what we’re discussing gets put into place. Exactly. This is the worst case scenario. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] Exactly, because the thing is, these are the, I mean, Trump on the campaign trail talked about this in many different ways, but if this were to be implemented at 60% towards China, think about it. Everything you buy, your iPhone, your T-shirt, your clothing toys for your kids, everything would go up in theory by 60%. And that’s of course something that would have implications both for prices of those things, but also for the sales of those things. 00:54:43 [Speaker Changed] What about the restrictions on immigration, both legal and illegal? 00:54:48 [Speaker Changed] So pure estimates that there are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the US and roughly half of them probably have a job. So that’s around 6 million. Total employment in the US is about 160 million. So if there’s 160 million people in the US in total that have a job and 6 million of these are illegal immigrants, that means if you remove millions of people with through deportations, you will remove like two, three, 4% of the workforce. And Pew and others, American Immigration Council, they find that where do illegal immigrants work? They work in three sectors, agriculture, construction, and restaurants or services. So the consequence of this, it’s up to 14% of workers in agriculture and construction who are illegal immigrants. And if this is the case, then of course means that you will likely see wage inflation in construction, wage inflation in agriculture and wage inflation in restaurants. So that also means that if we do get deportations, even if we get restrictions on immigration, that’s very meaningful. 00:55:43 In particular because the starting point is a very strong economy. The consequence is that I will begin to worry again about not only overheating in inflation, but maybe also overheating in the labor market if you remove workers and suddenly there are fewer workers left to compete for their available jobs. And that could exactly be why you’re beginning to see in the jolts that job openings are actually beginning to move higher because it could be that there’s already some issues around what is the labor market going to look like if we are going down a road where we may see deportations or some very significant restrictions on immigration. 00:56:15 [Speaker Changed] Alright, so those first two are the negative policies. Let’s talk about potentially positive policies like corporate tax cuts and deregulation. How do you see that impacting the economy in the markets? 00:56:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so if we rewind just for a second and think back to 2017 where the corporate tax rates were lower from 35 to 21%, I remember household taxes were lower from 39.6 to 37%. In 2017, we saw both household taxes came down and corporate taxes came down. And now Trump has talked about lowering corporate taxes on domestic manufacturers in addition to from 21, but all the way down to 15%. That means that manufacturers will now see if this happens, of course, a tailwind to production. Just as a footnote, as you and I of course also talk about often manufacturing is actually only about 10% of GDP and 10% of employment. So it’s a little bit special that a sector that’s only 10% of the economy continues to get so much attention. But nevertheless, the definition of Make America great again is probably that manufacturing should come back. 00:57:14 And if that’s the case, even though it only makes up 10% of GDP lowering corporate taxes for domestic manufacturers would indeed also be something that’s positive. So that policy alone would be a lift to inflation and also a lift to GDP. And on deregulation, of course, we don’t know quite exactly what deregulation is going to look like if it’s for financial services, if it’s for energy, if it’s for transportation, we remains to be seen what area it will be in. But broadly speaking, of course, deregulation would also be releasing animal spirits. It would also be boosting GDP growth and it would actually, ultimately, deregulation normally would be putting downward pressure on inflation, at least in the longer run. So those policies, exactly as you’re saying, Barry would certainly be tailwinds in particular GDP growth. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] So you’ve discussed policy uncertainty as a potential concern because we have no idea what the tariffs are gonna look like, what the deregulation will look like, at least there’s some specificity with manufacturing corporate tax rates and exactly where, where the president wants those to go. How do you deal with the variability of, Hey, we have no idea what this looks like. How do you build a model with so many unknowns built into it? Yeah, 00:58:31 [Speaker Changed] This is indeed very complicated from a forecasting perspective. There is no room in my Excel spreadsheet for the US economic outlook to stuff in uncertainty. I can have, and I do have various small Mickey Mouse models where VIX and the move index and volatility measures are included, but they are not a central part of the overall outlook, simply because as you’re saying, we just don’t know exactly how to quantify that risk. But that being said, it is still the case that if there is uncertainty, that does obviously have implications for business planning, for household planning. If you don’t know what’s coming, if you don’t know exactly what the nature of policies is going to look like, then of course it does bring some elevated levels of risk that people may be holding back with doing things they otherwise would have done simply because of the uncertainty of everything from immigration policies, tax policies, tariffs, and all the other things that we have talked about. So that’s why policy uncertainty is something that is holding back investment and spending decisions by households and by firms. 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] So we talked earlier about CapEx. How significant are administration policies to corporate America spending and investing and and building out what is likely to be the next generation of of economic drivers? 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think that there are two dimensions to that issue. Namely, first of all, we already have in place a number of important tailwinds to CapEx and business spending, namely AI and data center. Boom, it doesn’t matter what the fit funds rate is doing, we will have an AI and data center boom no matter what interest rates are doing because everyone wants to invest and should be investing in ai. Secondly, we probably also have energy transition because energy is needed to power the data centers. I also think strongly this is getting financing, including from us at Apollo, long-term investments in energy transition, long-term investments in data centers because these long-term investments are simply needed and this is something that needs to be done. We will also have a structural tailwind also from property defense. Defense spending has been going up. The rest of the world is also spending more on defense. 01:00:30 Again, that is also something that is humming in the background supporting growth overall. Now specifically to different policies, obviously with deregulation, obviously with tax cuts, obviously broadly speaking, with policies that are America first and make America great again, we’ll probably from a cyclical perspective also be giving a boost to CapEx spending domestically. One way of saying the cyclical part of the outlook is really that the animal spirits that have been released after Trump was elected, now that companies have, at least the view seems to be that there’s a more business friendly environment. And for that reason, more business spending will be taking place is from a cyclical perspective adding to the other structural things that I just listed. So that’s a reason to be actually quite bullish overall on the CapEx and business spending outlook. 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned defense, you mentioned energy. What about technology and what about crypto seems to have found a, a whole new tailwinds with the the most recent election? 01:01:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so that’s of course a lot more complicated and and more recently we got a coin both from the president and of course also from Melania. And this is raising of course, some different questions about the the crypto world more generally. But I will say that the technology and blockchain and investment in AI and investment, generally speaking and getting more productive and doing things more productively and efficiently is certainly something that is here to stay. And I think that that broadly speaking is also a tailwind to the overall outlook. 01:02:01 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really fascinating. I only have you for a couple of more minutes, let’s jump to our favorite questions that I get to ask all of my guests. It’s great having that baseline of what everybody else has said, but let’s just start really simply, what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? So 01:02:21 [Speaker Changed] One of my favorite podcasts of course is Masters in Business. 01:02:24 [Speaker Changed] Stop Enough. Okay. 01:02:25 [Speaker Changed] But that’s true. I know you to more than 500 episodes. I can’t believe it. It’s 10 years ago since I sat with you here last time. 01:02:31 [Speaker Changed] I know when I first began, I had dark hair. Now it’s great. 01:02:34 [Speaker Changed] I think, well, I actually had hair, so I think that I was perhaps one of your first customers here in the studio, but I do That’s correct. Also, listen to, we have actually our own view from Apollo podcast, but I also watch, one series that I’ve been watching is the Jaal on Peacock, which is basically very, very James Pon like series about a guy who’s going around Europe and doing all kinds of things and And what’s the name of that jackal? The Jacque 01:03:03 [Speaker Changed] Jackal 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] Oral? Yeah, the Jaal. How are you pronounce it? Here comes my 01:03:07 [Speaker Changed] Dan Dan accent. Like the spy novel. The jackal, exactly. 01:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Oh 01:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Really? I’m trying to remember who wrote that. Oh, 01:03:12 [Speaker Changed] So, but there was, this was originally a movie in France in the 1970s, but this is something that’s playing now on Peacock. And I have been watching, this is like, I think it’s eight episodes and he’s traveling around Europe. It’s really fascinating. It’s actually, it’s really well done. 01:03:26 [Speaker Changed] We mentioned Binky earlier. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:03:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, my first mentor was my professor in economics in Copenhagen. His name is Neil Terson. He just turned 90, and I celebrated his birthday here in December. But he was the one that really put me on track to thinking about economics. I did my PhD with him and he sent me that year to Princeton. And he was the one who got me going first. And then when I joined the IMF, pinky was there. There were also several others. David Lan also played a very important role. And there was also another, actually happened to be Danish guy. His name is Fleming Lazen. He’s now retired, who was also a very important mentor for me. And then when I came to the OECD, I worked very closely together with a gentleman called Vincent Cohen, who’s actually still there also. And also another colleague, Alanis is who’s also still there. 01:04:14 So they have all been teaching me various ways of how do you think about things, the importance of a framework, the importance of what are the arguments that we put up on the scale for something happening. There are some arguments why the stock market may be going up. There’s some arguments why the stock market may be going down. Let’s try to have a systematic approach to how it is that we talk about things. So that’s been very influential. And finally, on, on, on Wall Street or in Deutsche Bank, and of course also here, Apollo, everyone around me and living in the private sector and the commercial world. And of course, very importantly also here, thinking about investing in private assets, not least my current CEO Mark Rowan. And the inspiration in terms of how he is really, in my view, a genius. Changing the financial system and moving things in the, in the direction that’s the future of finance is playing a very important impact and playing a very important role and having an important impact on my thinking also today. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really fascinating. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:13 [Speaker Changed] So I have been reading, and I just finished the Two Parent Privileged by Melissa Kearney. And that has to do with this, of course, unique discussion around what does it mean to have two parents? What does it mean to have one parent? What are the differences from a sociological perspective for different types of organizing yourself as a family? This has been, it was very interesting and and quite eye-opening when you think about a lot of different things going on in society today. Hmm. 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Give us one other, what’s one of your all time favorites? 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, well, of course there’s your book after the bailout. Okay. So now we have, just to make sure for that, to make sure we have that on the record. But I think that broadly speaking, I spend a lot of my time just getting back to Square the circle here in terms of what we spoke about earlier. I do spend a lot of my time reading the economists, reading newspapers, try to come up with ideas for daily sparks. I try to think about questions I get from clients, questions I get internally. Can we get data with this? I ask my team, which several of them are sitting in India, Hey, can you overnight come up with a chart on this, on that? Can we find data for how many people go to Broadway shows? Can we find data for all kinds of things that I would normally try to say, well, we can’t really find any data for this, but let’s try to dig a little bit deeper and see if there is any data that can help us. So I do also spend my a lot of my time on Twitter, social media, reading newspapers, watching Bloomberg shows and figuring out what are we talking about? What data do we have? Is this conversation correct or are there actually ways where we should take this conversation in a different direction because there are other dimensions that are more important. Huh. Really, 01:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Really fascinating. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either economics or finance? 01:07:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think this is of course a very important question, but I would say read the Economist, watch Bloomberg Surveillance. Listen to podcasts like Masters in business, try to do the homework that is really, really hard. And we have all been through this process. You will feel that it’s quote unquote not rewarded, but you will learn more and more. You will get to know and understand more and more, and in particular, given how the world is moving with private markets becoming more and more important, try to understand and get a good understanding on what is private equity, what is private credit? How, what is the evolution in private markets? How is that relative to public markets? Try to get a broader view on what does finance mean and where is finance going? And that can really only be done by reading your textbooks, trying to stay up to date on recent developments. The textbooks in some cases are a little bit behind, but really trying to listen and try to think hard about and lean back in your chair, go for a long walk in a green park and think about, okay, what is it that I have just learned? What is it that I’ve just been told? And how does that fit in with my view of what is overall the outlook for financial markets? And how should I think about how the financial system hangs together? Huh, 01:08:13 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 30 years ago or so when you were first getting started? 01:08:23 [Speaker Changed] Well, this is something that’s very important and close to my heart because what I had not appreciated until recently is the very important part that private markets play. So there are 6 million businesses in the US with employment. So that’s a complicated way of saying there are 6 million businesses that have workers working inside those businesses. And why is that important? Because we spend so much time on the s and p 500 and we study these companies incredibly in incredible detail. And you then turn around and say, okay, those 500 companies are really interesting. But what about the remaining 5.9 million companies that are not in s and p 500? How do they get financing? Who owns them? How do they get financing for expanding? If they want to build a new factory, how do they get financing? If they wanna hire more workers, how do they get financing if they want to expand in another country and private markets? 01:09:15 And the role of private markets? I wish that I, earlier on in my macroeconomic career, had spent some more time thinking much more deeper around what is it that’s going on in everything else than in the s and p 500? Because remember, of total employment in the us, total employment in the s and p 500 companies in very round numbers is about 25 million people. And total employment in the US is 160 million people. So it is only in round numbers around 20% of employment in the US economy that is in the s and p 500. And that’s a very high estimate because s and P also employs people outside the us. So that means that 80% of employment in the US is outside the s and p 500. What do these people do? How do we measure them? And what businesses do they work in? And do they have the financing? Can they get the financing? How do they get growth so that the economy can growth also outside the s and p 500? 01:10:05 [Speaker Changed] Thorsten. This has been absolutely fascinating. I really appreciate how generous you’ve been with your time. We have been speaking with Torsten Slack. He is the chief economist and partner at Apollo Global Management. If you enjoy this conversation, well be sure and check out any of the previous 530 we’ve done over the past 10 and a half years.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/04/2025 4:58:32 AM PST by marcusmaximus The Kremlin on Tuesday called US President Donald Trump's plans to exchange Ukrainian rare earth minerals for further military aid a “commercial proposal.” -snip- “Well, probably, if we call a spade a spade, this is an offer to buy aid, that is, not to continue to provide it on a gratuitous or other basis, but to provide it on a commercial basis,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. “It is better, of course, not to provide assistance at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,” Peskov further said. He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise. He went on to say the new US administration has not yet made any decisions on the possibility of returning Russian diplomatic property seized by Washington, stressing that Moscow will take reciprocal measures should Poland try to seize such property.

Buying “outright “ still gives money to Zand Ukraine. However if you mean trade minerals for money or weapons, then I agree. In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive. Still think there is a good chance that China will annex much of eastern Russian “federation”.

"In a time of desperate need and vulnerability, the Ukrainian authorities, coerced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and financed by the World Bank, took advantage of COVID-19 measures to drive forward their own liberal agenda and lift the long-standing ban to allow the sale of farmland in the country.

It is all already spoken for by contract.

He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise.

War’s ending and Putin’s oligarchs are already asking when they get their confiscated yachts back. ‘commercial proposal’ And why not? Selling us minerals will give Ukraine the money it needs, and we will no longer be a chump. “ Sounds commercial. I’d rather the US buy it outright than give that thief extension of the D party more money to pocket. Z being the thief” Confused by your comment. Buying “outright “ still gives money to Zand Ukraine. However if you mean trade minerals for money or weapons, then I agree. In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive. Still think there is a good chance that China will annex much of eastern Russian “federation”. Why buy the mill when you can own the cow. Speaking of “commercial”. The Ukraine already sold the rights to BlackRock. USA Today: please put up collateral for a lending program and if you don’t have the cash to pay back, well some of that fancy rock will help pay off your debt. We just can’t give you the money free, that would be crazy. /s The hidden message in this ‘proposal’ isn’t resounding loud enough to reach your ears deep in the sand. *shocker* /s It's been going on a long, long time -- considering the 2022 "invasion" but framing one's time frame to match the Biden pardon of his son from 2014....

"In a time of desperate need and vulnerability, the Ukrainian authorities, coerced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and financed by the World Bank, took advantage of COVID-19 measures to drive forward their own liberal agenda and lift the long-standing ban to allow the sale of farmland in the country.

It is all already spoken for by contract. And historically even in times of war commercial contracts are still binding. Actually, at the root, it is just old fashioned barter We are seeing worldwide press -- this one Turkish and another posted this morning from Azerbaijan -- to "report" all the while the conversations being had in the press are not official, and no official public negotiations are underway which either our US or the Russians have announced. Lots of speculation, lots of "sources say" and all, but it comes down to "influencers" "influencing." And not very well, either.

If you remember, Iraqi oil was to be used to pay back the US in our failed Iraqi war. It never was. As Ukraine is so hopelessly corrupt, we will see very little of the rare earth metals mined from there, history says so. “Iraqi oil was to be used to pay back the US in our failed Iraqi war. It never was.” Trump wasn’t our president at that time. There’s a BIG difference now. But we do not need Ukraine as a colonial dependency.

Title: 30 questions you should ask about DeepSeek
URL: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/30-questions-you-should-ask-about-deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T12:25:54Z
Full Content:
Ex-AI product lead, now AI journalist. Cutting through noise with critical analysis of ethics, business, and society. No hype. Just truth. In this post, AI expert Jing Hu provides the lowdown on DeepSeek and the state of AI. Check out the article and some more of her great deep dives on her Substack here. Let’s start with a question that might sting a little. When did we all become so bad at thinking and focus solely on being panicked? AI industry in panic after China’s DeepSeek overtakes ChatGPT and Meta— The Independent or DeepSeek tech wipeout erases more than $1 trillion in market cap as AI panic grips Wall Street— Business Insider People sell/act first, think later (or never). Algorithms amplify fear, headlines scream about China’s AI leap, and everyone’s left scrambling to separate reality from runaway hype. Here’s how one shockwave enhances the next: It is much easier to hit “sell” or repost how DeepSeek makes Sam Altman panic than to ask, Wait—what exactly are we panicked about? This isn’t about dismissing concerns. I simply refuse to drown in the noise. This article won’t spoon-feed you with my conclusion. Instead, I will walk you through my thought process while interrogating you with guided questions in clear categorization. You get to pick what is most critical to you. Very simple, three parts: Finally, a Survival Toolkit that sums up the red flags to spot via a mindmap template for you to download and expand your own thoughts at your own pace. It began in a Shanghai high-rise in 2021. Liang Wenfeng, was a hedge fund manager who made a billion-dollar bet that would alter AI history. As his team at High-Flyer Capital developed trading algorithms, Liang quietly ordered staff to acquire every available Nvidia A100 GPU in Asia. It is estimated he hoarded 10,000 chips through shell companies for faster stock predictions. At least, that was the plan in 2021. Then, in 2022, the Biden administration restricted the export of advanced computing chips. The Pivot 2023, Chinese regulators cracking down on quant funds. Liang stunned investors by redirecting 90% of their assets into an AI startup. Skeptics walked out; true believers stayed to build DeepSeek. Trial by Fire Rumor says the early prototypes leaked in 2024 through a junior engineer's GitHub account. But of course, this is a rumor. What we do know is that DeepSeek has polished open-source models that undercut rivals. Here’s their Github. Breakthrough The rise of DeepSeek has been nothing short of a disruptive underdog story. Think of it as “Temu of AI.” In May 2024, DeepSeek shook up the industry by releasing DeepSeek V2 as an open-source model, sparking a full-scale price war… at least in China. On December 26, 2024, they did it again. With DeepSeek V3, the prices are even lower, redefining industry expectations: $0.14 per million tokens. Shock and Awe On January 20, 2025, R1 was released. The news on everyone’s feed is that R1 architecture delivers OpenAI o1 level reasoning at 1/10th the compute cost. By Monday, January 27, 2025, triggers a $1T tech stock selloff (17% drop in Nvidia + 5.6% sector-wide decline) as investors question Nvidia's AI infrastructure dominance. A basic understanding of why DeepSeek R1 is so special is the foundation for you and me to ask critical questions. Three most important technical breakthroughs from DeepSeek’s R1 model. With no-brainer analogies, don’t worry, even if you aren’t a techie. Here’s the R1 Paper (only if you are interested, of course). The "Teamwork" AI Design (Mixture of Experts— MoE) Instead of a "jack-of-all-trades" AI like OpenAI o1, think of R1 as a team of specialized experts collaborating like a kitchen crew. There’s a master chef (the teacher model) who then trains line cooks (small models) through knowledge distillation. So a powerful AI can run on your laptop while staying smart, like getting Michelin-star meals from your home kitchen at a low cost. MoE focuses on modularity and specialization for efficient task handling; OpenAI o1 emphasizes deep reasoning within a single model framework optimized for complex problem-solving. Self-Taught Reasoning (using only Reinforcement Learning)DeepSeek’s AI learned to reason on its own by trial and error, without extra guidance. It was given problems (math, coding) and rewarded for correct answers and logical steps. Think of teaching a kid to ride a bike or play puzzle by letting them figure it out and rewarding the kid if they’ve done well. In contrast, OpenAI o1 is more like providing a structured problem-solving method and refining and improving within that framework. Predicting Multiple Steps Ahead (Multi-Token Prediction)The old way is like a chess player who only thinks one move ahead. On the other hand, DeepSeek R1 is like a chess player thinking several moves ahead. DeepSeek R1 predicts several words or steps at once. In comparison, OpenAI's o1 prioritizes deeper reasoning with step-by-step problem-solving. Knowledge Condensing (Distillation)Imagine you’re preparing for an exam. You have the option to go with a 1,000-page textbook or a 100-page study guide that captures the key points, summaries, and essential concepts. While the study guide doesn’t include every detail from the textbook, it’s compact and efficient enough to help you perform well on the exam. In AI terms, the textbook is the large, complex AI model (the "teacher"). The smaller, distilled model (the "student") is the study guide. The process of creating the study guide is knowledge distillation. Key questions you should ask to separate DeepSeek reality from hype: DeepSeek's claim of ultra-low training costs for their AI model has raised eyebrows in the tech community. It is also evident in their report that the training cost has excluded costs associated with prior research, ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. Still, the million as the unit of training cost starkly contrasts with the billions spent by US tech giants. If true (the H800 and the hours), it will disrupt the established business models. The precise methodologies underlying DeepSeek's breakthrough remain undisclosed. There’s also a back-of-envelope calculation from an analyst that supports the low-cost claim. Training cost comparison between DeepSeek V3 and Llama 3.1. DeepSeek, in theory, has no access (if not smuggled) to H100 GPU Those who question the claim: Some data scientists questioned whether DeepSeek had been developed with only 2,000 chips. They noted that the company might have operations with tens of thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used in development. Don't worry if you don't get any of these. The main takeaway is that, aside from the report by DeepSeek, no one yet can confirm their claim about training costs. It can be true… but we don't know until someone can replicate a similar model with an equally low cost. Key questions for you to ask: What’s the catch of this low cost? Could there be a tradeoffs, e.g., What can’t this AI do well, and why? Now, you’ve learned the foundation. Shockwave #1: Major Tech Players. DeepSeek R1 and more threaten the core premise of existing AI giants: dominance requires scale (more data, more compute, more $$). If a lean Chinese startup can match OpenAI o1’s reasoning at 1/10th the cost, what does that mean for the "spend billions to win" playbook? Shockwave #2: Chip Industry and Infracture. Many news and influencers argue that Jevons Paradox will kick in. Simply put: Cheaper models → More startups (more AI usage) → More GPU buyers. But what factors must exist for the Jevon paradox to be true? To say the least, it requires elastic AI demand, market needs, and other complementary resources to be available (e.g., engineers know how to build an efficient model as R1 does). So questions you should ask: Shockwave #3: Copyright Infringement and Data Privacy. DeepSeek’s success raises tricky legal and ethical questions about who truly “owns” AI, the data, or the model used to train the next generation. At the center of the debate is distillation (where a large model “teaches” a smaller model) and the copyrighted content used to train the earlier LLMs. Since the massive dataset is the fuel, where do privacy and intellectual property rights fit? Questions to ask Good read: OpenAI’s privacy policy. The first sentence in the policy: When you visit, use, or interact with the Services, we receive the following information about your visit, use, or interactions… DeepSeek’s policy, collects certain information when users set up an account). It’s really about who you want to give your data to…The Chinese government or American commercial companies. Shockwave #4: Startups and Smaller AI Firms Yes, lower-cost training and inference could open doors for resource-strapped ventures. But does that also mean smaller players suddenly face a more crowded space, competing with DeepSeek itself and a throng of new entrants? Shockwave #5: Enterprises and End Users DeepSeek isn’t pushing AI to do anything dramatically “new” regarding raw capabilities. It’s distilling knowledge from existing large models at a fraction of the usual cost. Would This efficiency revolution trickle down to enterprises and end users? Instead of a technical leap forward in intelligence by DeepSeek it is rather a cost revolution. However, that economic shift alone can significantly change how enterprises plan, deploy, and pay for AI. And how quickly people see tangible benefits every day. Shockwave #6: Geopolitical and Regulatory DeepSeek’s apparent success amid export controls spotlights a broader power struggle. Can bans on high-end chips (like Nvidia’s H100) actually curb AI development? Western nations face a choice: double down on regulations or adapt to a new competitive reality. While others are still panicking about DeepSeek's efficiency breakthrough, the smart ones ask more profound questions about where this leads us. What about the near-term future? The Real AGI Question R1-Zero's self-training capabilities raise fascinating possibilities. But instead of asking, "Is this AGI?" ask: What happens when AI can self-learn and self-improve at a fraction of today's cost? The real opportunity in DeepSeek's breakthrough isn't just about cheaper AI. It's about who can ask the right questions and act accordingly. Here’s the mindmap for you: Survival Toolkit.

Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the first quarter, PayPal expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.17, which is higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.13. Earnings for the year will come in at $4.95 to $5.10 a share, topping the $4.90 average estimate, according to LSEG. PayPal also announced a new $15 billion share buyback program, and expects to make around $6 billion in repurchases in 2025. Revenue increased about 4% in the quarter from $8.03 billion a year ago. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, was just short of estimates, coming in at $437.8 billion for the fourth quarter, versus the $438.2 billion analysts projected. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.91% from 1.96% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 47% from 45.8%. In 2024, transaction margin dollars grew 7% to $14.7 billion, bolstered by Braintree, a service Meta uses for credit-card processing. The company said it anticipates growth of 4% to 5% in transaction margin dollars in 2025 to $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion PayPal's stock is up 43% in the past year, as of Monday's close. CEO Alex Chriss, who joined the company in September 2023, is trying to revive growth at PayPal, which had been been mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree and payments app Venmo. Venmo's total payment volume rose 10% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss has said the two primary monetization levers are Venmo's debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. Monthly active accounts for the debit card grew more than 30% in 2024, and Pay with Venmo monthly actives increased more than 20%. The company added 8.8 million active accounts last year. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In 2024, branded checkout volume rose more than 6%, thanks in part to strength across large enterprise platforms. The other big product launch in 2024 was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. "The improvements we made to branded checkout, peer-to-peer, and Venmo, plus the progress we made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results," Chriss said in the earnings statement.

Title: Bitcoin Set For $150 Billion Inflow As Trump Pushes Sovereign Fund: Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-150-billion-inflow-trump-sovereign-fund/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T12:00:46Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin could see unprecedented capital inflows ranging from $150 billion to $500 billion as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday mandating the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund. The initiative—which did not explicitly reference BTC during its announcement—will be helmed jointly by US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The US sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is expected to be created within the next 12 months. Although official details remain sparse, market observers note that both Lutnick and Bessent have been vocal supporters of Bitcoin, prompting speculation that the nascent fund could include digital assets. Well-known BTC advocate Florian Bruce-Boye offered a sweeping outlook via X, suggesting the upcoming US sovereign wealth fund is destined to become “the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term.” He stated: “The USA will create a sovereign wealth fund. It is set to become the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term. That would be $2 trillion dollars. That is as big as BTC itself. With H. Lutnick and S. Bessent at the helm, it is highly likely that Bitcoin will be included in this sovereign wealth fund.” Bruce-Boye pointed to the personal investment profiles of both Lutnick and Bessent, emphasizing their favorable views on Bitcoin. According to his statements, Lutnick “has hundreds of millions in BTC and, according to his own statements, buys every dip,” while Bessent “sees Bitcoin as a freedom technology.” Drawing further parallels, Bruce-Boye highlighted how Norway’s $1.8 trillion fund and Saudi Arabia’s $1 trillion fund could add “another 1.5 times the market capitalization of Bitcoin” if they follow suit. He referenced a recent comment from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who mentioned a sovereign wealth fund seeking guidance on whether to invest “2% or 5%” in BTC. Bruce-Boye concluded by quantifying the possible capital flow: “3% of $4.8 trillion dollars is $150 billion. At current prices, that’s around 1.5 million BTC… And that’s only if the three largest build up a small position. Anyone who has not yet ‘studied’ Bitcoin should do so as soon as possible.” Echoing a similar optimism, Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer posted: “The US Sovereign Wealth Fund should reach $5T AUM pretty quickly. For context, Norway’s fund holds $2T, and they have a population of 6M people. 10% allocation to Bitcoin makes sense, so that’s about $500B buying over the next couple of years. Bullish.” Fahrer’s estimate pushes the potential inflow even higher, implying that if the US fund does indeed adopt a strategic BTC allocation, it could trigger a multi-year wave of institutional demand. Jeff Walton, digital capitalist and founder of True North, underscored the significance of Howard Lutnick’s leadership in a separate X post. Lutnick, who serves as both the US Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is known for his substantial personal position in BTC. Walton wrote: A couple of fun details about Howard and Cantor Fitzgerald: 1. Howard owns “hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin, and it’s going to be Billions” 2. Cantor Fitzgerald owns a 5% stake in Tether, and manages Tether’s treasury assets 3. Cantor is launching a $2 Billion Bitcoin financing lending business, that would use Bitcoin as collateral for USD loans. 4. “We will build the best platform for financing Bitcoin” 5. “We are Cantor Fitzgerald, and we will support Bitcoin” For now, the global BTC market watches and waits, aware that even a modest allocation from the incoming US sovereign wealth fund could reshape the landscape —and possibly herald a new wave of institutional participation worldwide. At press time, BTC traded at $99,450. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Volvo on Tuesday announced it was teaming up with Waabi, the self-driving truck startup backed by players like Nvidia (NVDA+2.77%) and Uber (UBER+7.38%), to jointly develop and deploy autonomous vehicles. The companies said they would integrate Waabi’s generative artificial intelligence-based technology into the trucks being developed by Volvo Autonomous Solutions, a unit of the Swedish luxury automaker. The trucks, Volvo’s VNL Autonomous, will be made at Volvo’s assembly plant in Virginia’s New River Valley. Testing is expected to begin later this year. “We are excited to integrate Waabi’s cutting-edge technology into our autonomous truck platform,” Volvo Autonomous Solutions’ chief product officer, Shahrukh Kazmi, said in a statement. Waabi CEO Raquel Urtasun said that “vertically integrating next-generation AI technology directly into an OEM’s vehicle production is the path forward” to making safe autonomous vehicles at scale. Last May, Waabi signed a multi-year lease on a trucking terminal in Dallas County, Texas, which will be the base for its operations in the state. The company first entered Texas in 2023, making trips between Dallas and Houston through its partnership with Uber Freight. It plans to expand testing in the state this year. In 2024, the company drew $200 million for its Series B funding round from investors such as Nvidia, Khosla Ventures, and Uber. Volvo has also invested in Waabi, participating in both the Series A and Series B rounds. Autonomous trucks have become an increasingly popular concept, potentially reducing the time it takes to transport goods and allowing companies to bypass the limitations of human workers. The industry is also mired in a debate over whether it has a shortage of human drivers or just difficulty retaining workers, largely thanks to long hours and poor wages. According to the consultancy McKinsey & Co., use cases for autonomous trucks could translate into a $616 billion global market in 2035. By that time, the U.S.’s autonomous heavy-duty trucking market could reach a roughly $178 billion valuation, with such vehicles accounting for 13% of all trucks on the road. Volvo has been working on autonomy for years, having developed an autonomous truck concept as early as 2017. A concept electric truck named Vera was unveiled in 2019 and put to work in a Swedish pilot program that year. Volvo has also partnered with Aurora Innovation (AUR-2.49%), a self-driving vehicle company based in Pittsburgh that works with several other companies, including Uber Freight and Continental. In May 2024, the companies debuted the VNL Autonomous at the ACT Expo in Las Vegas, describing the truck as a “purpose-designed and purpose-built” vehicle using Aurora’s hardware and software. In December, Volvo began hauling freight on autonomous trucks on two lanes, Dallas to Houston and Fort Worth to El Paso, as part of a partnership with DHL Supply Chain. Since the technology is still being tested, a safety driver is behind the wheel of those vehicles. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Salesforce is set to eliminate more than 1,000 positions as it enters its new fiscal year. According to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the job reductions coincide with ongoing hiring efforts to expand the company’s sales team for AI products. A source familiar with the matter told the news agency that affected employees would have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific departments impacted by the layoffs were not disclosed. Salesforce previously reported a total workforce of approximately 72,682 employees as of 31 January 2024. The firm has carried out multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year. In January 2024, Salesforce let go 700 of its employees, followed by an additional 300 in July. Despite the reductions, the cloud-based software firm continues to hire for AI-related roles. In particular, Salesforce has expanded its sales team to support Agentforce, an AI-powered virtual representative platform. CEO Marc Benioff announced in December 2024 that Salesforce had secured over 1,000 paid deals for the product, which automates tasks such as responding to customer inquiries and assessing potential sales opportunities. Salesforce’s enterprise cloud portfolio remains a key driver of revenue growth. The company’s data cloud and AI-driven tools, including Agentforce, have seen strong adoption among enterprise clients seeking to streamline workflows and manage large volumes of data. On its most recent earnings call, executives emphasised the role of Agentforce in the company’s strategy. Salesforce has been investing heavily in the platform’s expansion, with plans to hire 1,400 new employees in the fourth quarter to meet growing demand. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, released in December 2024. It reported $9.44bn in revenue for the quarter ending 31 October 2024, an 8% increase from the previous year. Salesforce raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $37.8bn to $38bn, slightly above its prior forecast. Earnings per share (EPS) projections were also revised upward to a range of $6.15 to $6.2. in addition, subscription and support revenue, which represents the bulk of the company’s income, increased by 9% YoY to $8.88bn. Operating cash flow surged 29% YoY to $1.98bn, while free cash flow rose 30% to $1.78bn. Salesforce is set to report fourth-quarter earnings later this month, which may provide further insight into its workforce strategy and AI expansion plans. The restructuring at Salesforce reflects the broader trend throughout the technology sector of companies restructuring their workforces in response to AI-driven changes and shifting business priorities. Over the past year, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all announced job cuts as they focus on emerging technologies and operational efficiencies.

Title: Integrations: From Simple Data Transfer To Modern Composable Architectures

Edoardo is a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, combining hands-on development expertise with a talent for technical communication. Through YouTube, Twitch, and … More about Edoardo ↬ Weekly tips on front-end & UX.Trusted by 200,000+ folks. This article has been kindly supported by our dear friends at Storyblok, a friendly headless CMS with a visual editor, nested components and customizable content blocks for websites and apps. Thank you! When computers first started talking to each other, the methods were remarkably simple. In the early days of the Internet, systems exchanged files via FTP or communicated via raw TCP/IP sockets. This direct approach worked well for simple use cases but quickly showed its limitations as applications grew more complex. The real breakthrough in enabling complex communication between computers on a network came with the introduction of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in the 1980s. RPC allowed developers to call procedures on remote systems as if they were local functions, abstracting away the complexity of network communication. This pattern laid the foundation for many of the modern integration approaches we use today. Here’s a simplified example using Python’s XML-RPC. RPC can operate in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous modes. Modern implementations such as gRPC support streaming and bi-directional communication. In the example below, we define a gRPC service called Calculator with two RPC methods, Calculate, which takes a Numbers message and returns a Result message, and CalculateStream, which sends a stream of Result messages in response. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) became the standard for enterprise integration, introducing a more structured approach to system communication. While SOAP provided robust enterprise features, its complexity, and verbosity led to the development of simpler alternatives, especially the REST APIs that dominate Web services communication today. But REST is not alone. Let’s have a look at some modern integration patterns. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the de facto standard for Web APIs, providing a simple, stateless approach to manipulating resources. Its simplicity and HTTP-based nature make it ideal for web applications. First defined by Roy Fielding in 2000 as an architectural style on top of the Web’s standard protocols, its constraints align perfectly with the goals of the modern Web, such as performance, scalability, reliability, and visibility: client and server separated by an interface and loosely coupled, stateless communication, cacheable responses. In modern applications, the most common implementations of the REST protocol are based on the JSON format, which is used to encode messages for requests and responses. GraphQL emerged from Facebook’s internal development needs in 2012 before being open-sourced in 2015. Born out of the challenges of building complex mobile applications, it addressed limitations in traditional REST APIs, particularly the issues of over-fetching and under-fetching data. At its core, GraphQL is a query language and runtime that provides a type system and declarative data fetching, allowing the client to specify exactly what it wants to fetch from the server. Often used to build complex UIs with nested data structures, mobile applications, or microservices architectures, it has proven effective at handling complex data requirements at scale and offers a growing ecosystem of tools. Modern applications often require real-time updates. For example, e-commerce apps need to update inventory levels when a purchase is made, or content management apps need to refresh cached content when a document is edited. Traditional request-response models can struggle to meet these demands because they rely on clients’ polling servers for updates, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. Webhooks and event-driven architectures address these needs more effectively. Webhooks let servers send real-time notifications to clients or other systems when specific events happen. This reduces the need for continuous polling. Event-driven architectures go further by decoupling application components. Services can publish and subscribe to events asynchronously, and this makes the system more scalable, responsive, and simpler. This is a simple Node.js function that uses Fastify to set up a web server. It responds to the endpoint /webhook, checks the type field of the JSON request, and refreshes a cache if the event is of type content.published. With all this background information and technical knowledge, it’s easier to picture the current state of web application development, where a single, monolithic app is no longer the answer to business needs, but a new paradigm has emerged: Composable Architecture. This evolution has led us to the concept of composable architecture, where applications are built by combining specialized services. This is where headless CMS solutions have a clear advantage, serving as the perfect example of how modern integration patterns come together. Headless CMS platforms separate content management from content presentation, allowing you to build specialized frontends relying on a fully-featured content backend. This decoupling facilitates content reuse, independent scaling, and the flexibility to use a dedicated technology or service for each part of the system. Take Storyblok as an example. Storyblok is a headless CMS designed to help developers build flexible, scalable, and composable applications. Content is exposed via API, REST, or GraphQL; it offers a long list of events that can trigger a webhook. Editors are happy with a great Visual Editor, where they can see changes in real time, and many integrations are available out-of-the-box via a marketplace. Imagine this ContentDeliveryService in your app, where you can interact with Storyblok’s REST API using the open source JS Client: The last piece of the puzzle is a real example of integration. Again, many are already available in the Storyblok marketplace, and you can easily control them from the dashboard. However, to fully leverage the Composable Architecture, we can use the most powerful tool in the developer’s hand: code. Let’s imagine a modern e-commerce platform that uses Storyblok as its content hub, Shopify for inventory and orders, Algolia for product search, and Stripe for payments. Once each account is set up and we have our access tokens, we could quickly build a front-end page for our store. This isn’t production-ready code, but just to get a quick idea, let’s use React to build the page for a single product that integrates our services. First, we should initialize our clients: Given that we created a blok in Storyblok that holds product information such as the product_id, we could write a component that takes the productSlug, fetches the product content from Storyblok, the inventory data from Shopify, and some related products from the Algolia index: We could then set a simple component state: And return a template with all our data: We could then use an event-driven approach and create a server that listens to our shop events and processes the checkout with Stripe (credits to Manuel Spigolon for this tutorial): And with this approach, each service is independent of the others, which helps us achieve our business goals (performance, scalability, flexibility) with a good developer experience and a smaller and simpler application that’s easier to maintain. The integration between headless CMSs and modern web services represents the current and future state of high-performance web applications. By using specialized, decoupled services, developers can focus on business logic and user experience. A composable ecosystem is not only modular but also resilient to the evolving needs of the modern enterprise. These integrations highlight the importance of mastering API-driven architectures and understanding how different tools can harmoniously fit into a larger tech stack. In today’s digital landscape, success lies in choosing tools that offer flexibility and efficiency, adapt to evolving demands, and create applications that are future-proof against the challenges of tomorrow.

Title: Are Trump and his supporters ready for a fight to the death?

(Article byÂ Paul Craig Roberts republished from PaulCraigRoberts.org) In an article in the current issue of theÂ City Journal, âCounterrevolution Blueprint,â Christopher F. Rufo, describes the extent to which the US government is in the hands of the enemy.Â Â In the 2020 presidential electionÂ employees of the Justice (sic) Department, gave 86 percent of their political contributions to Democrats. Labor Department employees gave 88 percent to Democrats. Health and Human Services 92 percent, and Education Department employees gave 97 percent.Â Â Rufo reports that these one-sided political donations are mirrored by tech companies and universities, bastions of left-wing ideologies and activism.Â To give you an idea of just how bad the situation is, the Treasury Department, the task of which is economic policy, financing the debt and raising revenue, during the Obama regime added a new bureaucracy, âThe office for Minority and Women Inclusion,â that is totally outside the Treasuryâs responsibilities.Â Â This office continued under Trumpâs first term, Rufo reports, and proselytized âcritical race theory as an operating ideology, hiring consultants to conduct training programs teaching Treasury employees that America is a nation of systemic racism with a 400-year history of racial terrorismâ that continues today.Â During the Biden regime another activist left-wing bureaucracy was created in the Treasury, an Equity Hub with a Counselor for Racial Equity. Janet Yellen, the Jewish Secretary of the Treasury, and Kamala Harris, the black Vice President, quickly announced a $8.7 billion fund for lending only to minority-owned businesses, a blatantly discriminatory policy in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.Â Â You can imagine how many âminority-ownedâ firms were quickly created Â so that âdeservingâ people could be made millionaires by the US taxpayers.Â Â And you can rest assured that neither Yellen nor Harris were held accountable for violating law and the Constitution. Not even this was enough. The Treasury forced federal contractors to implement DEI and monitored tax returns to make sure that tax-exempt donations to charities were racially balanced. Rufo describes the efforts of Nixon, Reagan, and Trump 1 to get the bureaucracy in compliance with the Presidentâs policy.Â Â All failed.Â Â Nevertheless, Rufo has hope for Trump 2, and he sets out the necessary elements for taking back the Presidentâs and the peopleâs power from a hostile civil service that is united against American values and are substituting the values of cultural marxism in their place. Rufo makes it clear that if Trump 2 fails, âthe American experiment will come to an end: bureaucratic rule will devour the constitutional order.â I certainly agree, having made many of these points myself.Â Â The question is:Â Â How realistic is it that Trump and a few appointees can subdue millions of people whose far-left ideology is guiding the US government and who not only despise Trumpâs view of America but also hate Trump personally.Â Â It is impossible for Trump to achieve unity with ideologues supported by the Democrat Party who are totally opposed to his view of America. The competence and objectivity of the civil service, long under liberal attack, was finished off when the Clinton regime pushed the white male senior civil service into early retirement in order to âmake roomâ for blacks and females. It was part of âaffirmative action.â The DEI legions have been growing for decades.Â Â They are firm in their belief that white heterosexuals are racist, and they intend to finish the process started with discriminatory âaffirmative actionâ to make normal white Americans second class citizens in law and position. Insouciant whites have enabled their own suppression by turning over positions of power to their enemies.Â Â It remains to be seen whether this was a fatal mistake that has doomed a merit-based color-blind society. Where among critical race theorists and denouncers of Western â which means white â Civilization is there good will to which Trump can appeal? Democrat judges and a number of insouciant Republican ones will act to block Trumpâs efforts. Trump has to be prepared to ride roughshod over them, their rulings be damned, just as they have ridden roughshod over the American people for decades.Â Â Trump cannot accept the rulings as anything but weaponized judicial statements no different than the weaponized law used against him, the January 6 protesters, and the right-to-life protesters. Karl Marx said that good will was not an operative principle because each class acted only in its own interest.Â Â So what mediates between classes?Â Â Marx said that violence was the only effective force in history.Â Â Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot relied on violence. Formerly I disputed this view of the efficacy of violence, but just as we did not deal with Hitler based on good will, we cannot rely on goodwill when dealing with internal enemies who intend to destroy America with open borders and legal privileges based on race, gender, and sexual preference. As I am convinced that good will has played a role in effecting reforms, today perhaps I would modify Marxâs claim. I would substitute âeffectiveâ in place of âonly.â Â Violence is an effective force in history. It seems that real change is impossible without it as the American Revolution exemplifies.Â Today the clash is no longer between economic classes based on material interest.Â Â The clash is ideological. The America-is-evil forces are intent on replacing a color-blind merit-based society with a society based on race, gender, and sexual preferenceÂ privilege. It is an ideological struggle like the one Lenin and Mao launched on Russian and Chinese societies.Â Â It is truly a fight to the death. If Trump loses, America loses as Rufo said.

Read more at:Â PaulCraigRoberts.org In an article in the current issue of theÂ City Journal, âCounterrevolution Blueprint,â Christopher F. Rufo, describes the extent to which the US government is in the hands of the enemy.Â Â In the 2020 presidential electionÂ employees of the Justice (sic) Department, gave 86 percent of their political contributions to Democrats. Labor Department employees gave 88 percent to Democrats. Health and Human Services 92 percent, and Education Department employees gave 97 percent.Â Â Rufo reports that these one-sided political donations are mirrored by tech companies and universities, bastions of left-wing ideologies and activism.Â To give you an idea of just how bad the situation is, the Treasury Department, the task of which is economic policy, financing the debt and raising revenue, during the Obama regime added a new bureaucracy, âThe office for Minority and Women Inclusion,â that is totally outside the Treasuryâs responsibilities.Â Â This office continued under Trumpâs first term, Rufo reports, and proselytized âcritical race theory as an operating ideology, hiring consultants to conduct training programs teaching Treasury employees that America is a nation of systemic racism with a 400-year history of racial terrorismâ that continues today.Â During the Biden regime another activist left-wing bureaucracy was created in the Treasury, an Equity Hub with a Counselor for Racial Equity. Janet Yellen, the Jewish Secretary of the Treasury, and Kamala Harris, the black Vice President, quickly announced a $8.7 billion fund for lending only to minority-owned businesses, a blatantly discriminatory policy in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.Â Â You can imagine how many âminority-ownedâ firms were quickly created Â so that âdeservingâ people could be made millionaires by the US taxpayers.Â Â And you can rest assured that neither Yellen nor Harris were held accountable for violating law and the Constitution. Not even this was enough. The Treasury forced federal contractors to implement DEI and monitored tax returns to make sure that tax-exempt donations to charities were racially balanced. Rufo describes the efforts of Nixon, Reagan, and Trump 1 to get the bureaucracy in compliance with the Presidentâs policy.Â Â All failed.Â Â Nevertheless, Rufo has hope for Trump 2, and he sets out the necessary elements for taking back the Presidentâs and the peopleâs power from a hostile civil service that is united against American values and are substituting the values of cultural marxism in their place. Rufo makes it clear that if Trump 2 fails, âthe American experiment will come to an end: bureaucratic rule will devour the constitutional order.â I certainly agree, having made many of these points myself.Â Â The question is:Â Â How realistic is it that Trump and a few appointees can subdue millions of people whose far-left ideology is guiding the US government and who not only despise Trumpâs view of America but also hate Trump personally.Â Â It is impossible for Trump to achieve unity with ideologues supported by the Democrat Party who are totally opposed to his view of America. The competence and objectivity of the civil service, long under liberal attack, was finished off when the Clinton regime pushed the white male senior civil service into early retirement in order to âmake roomâ for blacks and females. It was part of âaffirmative action.â The DEI legions have been growing for decades.Â Â They are firm in their belief that white heterosexuals are racist, and they intend to finish the process started with discriminatory âaffirmative actionâ to make normal white Americans second class citizens in law and position. Insouciant whites have enabled their own suppression by turning over positions of power to their enemies.Â Â It remains to be seen whether this was a fatal mistake that has doomed a merit-based color-blind society.

Title: Analysis-Europe's AI bulls pin hopes on 'Jevons Paradox' after DeepSeek rout

Tech stocks worldwide plunged on Jan. 27 after the launch of DeepSeek - apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less sophisticated chips - raised questions over the West's huge investments in chipmakers and data centres. At the heart of the selloff was U.S. advanced chipmaker and AI poster-child Nvidia, which lost 17% of its value, or close to $600 billion, in the largest one-day drop in market capitalisation for any company on record. Since then, tech stocks have rebounded, with European markets hitting new highs, and a 19th century economic theory is suddenly on everyone's lips: the Jevons Paradox. Named after English economist William Stanley Jevons, it posits that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand can increase - rather than decrease - as the price to use the resource drops. "I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere," said Helen Jewell, Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, EMEA. "This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment," said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand. "One of the big question marks from (last) Monday’s news is how much energy is going to be needed for the AI revolution?" The selloff hit direct and indirect AI plays alike. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, and sector peers ASMI and BE Semi all fell 7%-12% on Jan. 27, before recouping losses later in the week, as did Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure. "Jevons Paradox strikes again!" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of." THE NEW BUZZWORD On Friday, Tomasz Godziek, portfolio manager of the Tech Disruptors fund at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said lower AI costs could exemplify the Jevons Paradox. "Ultimately, this could fuel a new wave of AI investment, creating fresh opportunities, particularly in software and inference technologies," Godziek said. Portfolio managers at Thematics Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis IM, cited Jevons Paradox as one reason they believe demand for AI chips may remain healthy. Mark Hawtin, head of the Liontrust global equities team, also said his investment thesis on AI was reinforced by the news on Jan. 27, flagging the paradox. "Everyone has become an expert on Jevons Paradox," said Aviva Investors portfolio manager Kunal Kothari, who manages a UK equity income fund with around 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in assets. "The falling cost of improved productivity through GenAI will likely benefit companies in the UK market generally, as they will predominantly be consumers of these technologies," he added, pointing to data and software names like RELX, LSEG, Experian and Sage as likely beneficiaries. DATA CENTRE NEEDS IN FOCUS The need for data centres and the vast amounts of power required to run them has driven a lot of AI investing in Europe already, given that there aren't any homegrown rivals to the likes of Nvidia, whose shares have rocketed by about 200% in under two years. "There is an implicit assumption that the adoption and usage of AI would require increasingly more chips, and more data centre capacity and power consumption," said Kasper Elmgreen, CIO of fixed income and equities at Nordea Asset Management. "What DeepSeek has done is to question what is required from that route and what can be delivered by making much better software." Not everyone is convinced of the new rationale, including Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA. "Whilst many Nvidia optimists pointed to Jevons Paradox to help them sleep better at night ... it was less convincing in the short term after what has been a meteoric rise in Nvidia shares," he wrote in a note.

Title: Should you withdraw your money from poorly performing property funds, or wait it out?

Their investments may be dropping in value but many investors in Irish property funds are finding themselves stuck as restrictions on cashing in their investments remain in place. It’s a far cry from the heady days of the Celtic Tiger, when commercial property funds were the best-performing asset class – outperforming even Irish equities. While property funds struggled in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they turned it around but the environment has become challenging once more. After a buoyant 2015, when Irish Life’s fund returned almost 20 per cent, it has been in the red for four of the last five years. Similarly, both Zurich Life and New Ireland’s funds had negative returns in the year to January 6th, with Aviva’s fund the only one of the four in the black – with a return of just 0.2 per cent. Suzie Nolan, head of property with Aviva, says the life and pensions company’s property fund is facing “similar challenges evident in the wider Irish property market”. These include economic threats such as inflation as well as geopolitical uncertainty. The move towards working from home, and its consequent impact on demand for office space, as well as the ever-increasing requirement for landlords to provide more sustainable space have also had an impact. Funds started restricting withdrawals back in spring 2023, as a sharp change in direction on interest rates at the European Central Bank saw a surge in the number looking to withdraw their money. They feared increased funding costs could lead to project writedowns that could push down the valuation of such funds. It is not unusual for property funds to stop access to withdrawals, though that doesn’t mean investors are any happier to find themselves locked in at an inopportune time in the cycle. They typically carry warnings, like that of Zurich Life: “If you invest in this fund, there may be extended periods when you do not have any access to your money. “This means you could be waiting for a significant period of time before you are able to encash your investment,” Zurich Life says. And that is precisely the case at the moment. Irish Life has had a six-month waiting period on withdrawals since March 2023, while Zurich Life has now stopped investments both in – and out – of its fund. A spokesman says that “no inflows are permitted into the Zurich Property Fund, and a waiting period applies for withdrawals or switches out. The fund is reviewed on a regular basis and the restrictions for inflows and outflows may change in the future”. This means that the fund is shrinking, down from about €33 million in March 2023 to about €18 million as of August this year. Aviva introduced a moratorium of up to six months back in November 2023, due to “net outflows” from the fund and, according to a spokeswoman, this still applies. The holdings of the fund, which merged with the Friends First Irish Commercial Property fund back in May 2022, include: Blackrock Village Centre and Zurich House, both in Blackrock in south Dublin; the Globe retail park in Naas, Co Kildare; and 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2, which is currently available for letting. Typically, a fund will introduce a notice period to give fund managers time to make any property sales needed to pay future withdrawals. Often, funds will move to restrict withdrawals if cash reserves decline. Normally property funds keep a buffer of about 10 to 15 per cent of assets in cash to meet the demand for withdrawals. This time around, however, most of the funds are cash rich. New Ireland, for example, has 23.4 per cent in cash; Zurich Life has more than a quarter of its assets in cash, according to its most recent report; and Aviva has 12.2 per cent. New Ireland, which had a restriction, is one of the few funds with no restrictions. A spokesman says the New Ireland Property Fund is open to new investment, and there are no restrictions on withdrawals and switches. So should investors apply to withdraw their funds or wait it out? Well, the issue here can be that, depending on the fund, the request will be processed only at the end of the deferral period and at the unit price of the fund at that time – ie the unit price after the six-month deferral, not the unit price at the time the instruction was given. As a result, you are taking a gamble on where the price will go. You might also be faced with an early encashment penalty, so check the small print before making a decision. Many funds have also changed how they are being priced. New Ireland’s fund, for example, is priced on a disposal basis, “which ensures that policyholders exiting the fund pay their fair share of property acquisition costs” the spokesman says. This has been the case since 2020. This can happen when more money is going out of the fund than coming in, and is a strategy used to contain losses. At a time of growth, when a fund is expanding and purchasing assets, it will usually be priced on an acquisition basis. Moving to a disposal basis can be bad news for investors, especially in a market downturn; when New Ireland made the change it cut the unit price of the fund by as much as almost 8 per cent. Given an overall office vacancy rate in Dublin of about 16 per cent – up from about 5 per over the last five years – the city now has one of Europe’s highest rates. This is also reflected in the property funds. Irish Life’s vacancy rate is less than 10 per cent, while New Ireland’s is 9.7 per cent and Aviva’s is 8.4 per cent (which includes 3 per cent of strategic vacancy for redevelopment purposes). Funds also have run into difficulty when trying to offload properties. Irish Life acquired 1 Harbourmaster Place, KPMG’s current headquarters in the IFSC, back in 2015 for €50 million. It put it back on the market in 2020 for €54 million but it failed to sell. Now KPMG is set to move to Hibernia Reit’s development in Harcourt Square, and the lease on 1 Harbourmaster is due up in 2026. Despite the challenges however, fund managers remain upbeat about the future. State Street Global Advisors, which manages New Ireland’s fund, expects a bump in transactions as interest rates fall, which will lead to a “closer alignment of buy and sell side pricing expectations” – in other words more competitive prices. It also expects vacancy rates to fall in the office sector. “Despite offices generally being out of favour with investors in recent years, there are now signs that interest in the sector is turning” Aviva’s Nolan expects more stability in valuations this year, “with the possibility of some upward movements in certain subsectors, such as retail parks, as new rental evidence becomes available”. And she expects more economic opportunities to come through in 2025, such as the reducing cost of debt and a widening of the spread between bond rates and property yields, “both of which should be an impetus for further investment in the property sector”, she says. Aviva itself expects to be busy, with projects including the redevelopment of a site in Dundalk to deliver a primary care centre for the Health Service Executive expected to start this year, alongside other “value-add initiatives”, such as further letting activity and the rolling out of additional sustainability programmes.

Title: Bitcoin Recovers Above $100,000 After This Weekend’s Sharp Drop

Bitcoin prices climbed back above $100,000 today. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin bounced back on Monday, February 3, rising above $100,000 once again after falling to nearly $90,000 over the weekend. The world’s most valuable digital currency reached roughly $102,600 close to 5 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up more than 10% from the recent low of close to $91,000 it attained on Sunday, February 2, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView show. When explaining the digital asset’s latest price movements, analysts cited several factors, including the recent tariff announcements, supply-demand dynamics and also the impact of speculative bets being liquidated. One market observer who weighed in on these developments is the the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. “Over the weekend President Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China,” she noted via email. “Since this was announced on 2/1/2025, Saturday, this caused a lot of fear for crypto traders on how this could impact traditional markets.” “Many, including Blackrock have indicated that Bitcoin is an ideal asset during volatile times of economic uncertainty, similar to Gold,” she emphasized. The analyst also emphasized sharp changes in leveraged positions, citing data provided by crypto analytics platform CoinGlass. “According to CoinGlass most traders took a long position and out of the historic $2.2B liquidations, ~$1.5B longs were liquidated while gold hit an all-time high,” Wendy noted. “This indicates Bitcoin traders, may have anticipated that Bitcoin would continue with bullish price action as uncertain economic conditions could have occurred Monday due to Trumps tariffs (similar to gold)." "However, the 25% tariffs placed on Mexican imports has been paused for the next 30 days which could indicate less volatility,” she stated, emphasizing today’s announcement that President Donald Trump was postponing tariffs on Mexico until early next month. Markets also found out today that Trump planned to pause the Canadian tariffs he announced over the weekend after speaking with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Certain analysts who offered input for this article made today’s increase in bitcoin prices seem predictable given existing market conditions. “Bitcoin’s recovery to $100K and above is no surprise—it’s simple supply and demand,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday people are realizing fiat’s inevitable decline and moving into the best money ever invented,” he added. “Weak hands sold in the recent dip, but strong holders stepped in, stacking harder,” Klippsten stated. “Meanwhile, global uncertainty is driving more people to opt out of failing fiat. This is just the beginning.” Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also weighed in. “Today’s rebound was simply a recovery from the absurd drop yesterday,” he stated through email. “In most cases, the correlation with certain fiat markets works against Bitcoin; yesterday, had US equities markets been open, it would have worked very much in favor of BTC,” Enneking emphasized. “The drop on Sunday hit ridiculous proportions because there was nothing to slow it down and fear totally dominated greed; the drop only slowed once Asia markets had opened and had totally reversed several hours after US markets had done the same,” he stated. “So, billions of long positions wiped out and another data point created for folks who are considering investing in the crypto ecosystem,” Enneking concluded. Alex Lin, cofounder and general partner at venture capital firm Reforge, also weighed in, highlighting the strong interest of cryptocurrency buyers. “BTC’s rebound above $100,000 after its weekend lows points to a significant supply squeeze,” he wrote through emailed comments. “Over the past few days, retail investors capitulated due to fears sparked by Trump’s trade war headlines. However, large players and institutions took advantage of the dip to accumulate, as shown by the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which indicated strong buyer demand with a noticeable premium,” Lin stated. “This activity underscores BTC’s resilience and suggests potential bullish momentum, especially as confidence in the broader market outlook remains strong,” he added.

February 03, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

Title: Searching For Yield in All of The Safe Places
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/02/searching-for-yield-in-all-of-the-safe-places/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T01:51:49Z

What kind of investor are you? Do you want yield, safety, yield with a reasonable risk, or total return? I created a ranking system to combine Risk, Yield, Return, Quality, Trend, and Tax-Efficiency factors into an overall rating. I used yield divided by Ulcer Index which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns to limit the number of categories that I evaluate. My favorites may not be the same as yours. Table #1 shows how I rank the categories. I will be discussing each Lipper Category in the order of the “Overall” column. Approximately 10% of my bond investments are in six of the eight categories but the bulk of my bond investments are in bond ladders and core bonds along with diversification into global and international income categories. Table #1: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted all mutual funds and exchanged traded funds using the MFO Premium Fund Screener and Lipper global dataset. What Table #2 tells us is that global high-yield and short high-yield categories don’t have as many funds or assets under management, and investors should invest with caution. Loan participation funds are interesting because they have a lower percentage of assets rated below investment grade, a small effective duration, and a high yield. High-yield categories have the highest 30d yields and the lowest-rated quality assets. Core plus bond funds have a longer duration and have performed poorly with rising rates. Table #2: Metrics for Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 is based on the history of nearly 400 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The top four categories have current yields of about 6% or more, full cycle returns of 4% to 7%, and drawdowns during severe market downturns of 13% to 20%. If investing in these categories go in with eyes wide open. By comparison, during the Dotcom Full Cycle from September 2000 to October 2007, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of around 2.0% The bottom four categories have lower yields and lower risk. Core plus bond funds performed relatively well during the financial crisis. I have invested in multi-sector funds as a middle-of-the-road option. Table #3: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I selected one fund, most interesting to me as a moderately conservative investor, from each of the eight Lipper Categories covered in the article. Table #4 is packed with useful information about risk (MFO Risk, MaxDD %, Bear Markets), risk-adjusted return (MFO Rating), returns (APR, Full Cycle), trends (Fund Flow, EMA), quality (Quality, Junk), and expenses (ER, FMR), and yield. Last month, I bought Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a lower-risk fund with a 30d yield of 6.0% and Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL) with a 30d yield of 7.2% but a little more risk. I bought Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) with a 30d yield of 5.2%. It has about 21% in equity and is higher risk and higher potential reward. The funds are loosely sorted with the safest to the left and riskier to the right in Table #4. For a future article, I have screened high-yielding funds rated with an MFO Risk of “Very Conservative” and Great Owl First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), and Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (AAA) are among the fourteen on the list. Table #4: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The steady profile and low volatility can be observed in Figure #2 below for First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), and to a lesser extent Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL). As longer-term yields start to stabilize, I expect JPMorgan Income ETF (JPIE), Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX), and American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP) to start to perform better. Note that some of these funds have averaged a respectable return of 7% to 13% over the past two years. Figure #2: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Loan Participation Funds: Funds that invest primarily in participation interests in collateralized senior corporate loans that have floating or variable rates. Loan participation funds are a diverse group that can make returns of 5% to 8% during rising or falling rates. They can have positive returns during a mild recession, but some may lose 20% or much more during a severe financial crisis. Percent Junk Plus Not Rated is a fairly good indicator of performance during a severe downturn in bond prices as shown in Figure #3. For this reason, I bought more of Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) than I did of Franklin Senior Loan ETF (FLBL). Figure #3: 2022 Returns Versus Percent Junk Plus Not Rated Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Most of the loan participation funds that I selected for Table #5 have lower risk and volatility; however, BlackRock Floating Rate Income Portfolio (BFRAX) had a drawdown of 19.6% during the financial crisis compared to Fidelity Floating Rate High Income (FFRHX) which had a drawdown of 8.4%. Table #5: High Performing Loan Participations Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of my favorites because of its low drawdown and volatility which can be observed in Figure #4. It invests in higher-quality assets. Figure #4: High Performing Loan Participations Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Short high-yield funds have a lower risk compared to most other categories in this article with decent returns compared to other short-term bond funds. I bought Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) because it has a lower percentage of “Junk” rated bonds and a lower drawdown. Of the ETFs, I favor Xtrackers Short Duration High Yield Bond ETF (SHYL). Table #6: High Performing Short High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I focus on performance over the last year or two because the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates, but check how the fund performed during the latest downturn. While Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) has underperformed recently, it had a lower drawdown during the COVID recession. Figure #5: High Performing Short High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Global High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from both domestic and foreign fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. The global high-yield category does not have many quality funds, but I identify Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) and AB Short Duration High Yield ETF (SYFI) as high performers with respectable yields, but moderately large drawdowns. Table #7: High Performing Global High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Of the two funds, I favor Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) for its risk-adjusted performance. Figure #6: High Performing Global High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Of the ETFs, I like iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG) and expect it to perform better during falling rates or a market downturn with less volatility. I bought modest amounts of Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) and Fidelity High Income (SPHIX) for diversification within the high-yield category.

Figure #7 shows the diverse range of performance of high-yield funds due in part to hedging, duration, percent junk, and owning equity. Figure #7: High Performing High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years. Columbia Threadneedle Investments wrote As Interest Rates Rise, Investors May Look To Floating-Rate Funds explaining that while floating-rate bonds do well when rates are stable or rising, they tend to underperform when rates are falling. I favor Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF (FLDR) for its high yield and low volatility.

Figure #8: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Multi-Sector Income: Funds that seek current income by allocating assets among several different fixed-income securities sectors (with no more than 65% in any one sector except for defensive purposes), including U.S. government and foreign governments, with a significant portion of assets in securities rated below investment-grade. Exchange-traded funds are relatively new to the Multi-Sector Income category and of the two, I prefer JP Morgan Income ETF (JPIE). I purchased modest amounts of both the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond (VMSAX) and Fidelity Strategic Income (FADMX) for Traditional IRAs. Table #10: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #9: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of one to five years. I favor Great Owl First Trust Short Maturity ETF (FTSM) for its low volatility and drawdown. I own Fidelity Intermediate Bond (FTHRX) but traded a modest portion for other bond funds discussed in this article.

Figure #10: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Core Plus Bond Funds: Funds that invest at least 65% in domestic investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with any remaining investment in non-benchmark sectors such as high-yield, global, and emerging market debt. These funds maintain dollar-weighted average maturities of five to ten years. This is my least favorite category as its total return has been hampered as rates rose because of its longer duration, but I will continue to monitor it throughout the year. It is a category that I may want to own in the future as longer-term rates stabilize. The standout core plus bond fund is the Great Owl American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP). Table #12: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #11 shows the one-year trends on core plus funds have been strong but the recent three-month trends are waving red flags. I will continue to monitor. Figure #11: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. To prepare for 2025, I invested in high-yielding funds with low to moderate risk. These are the low-hanging fruit. There is plenty of opportunity to increase yields along with higher risk by investing in different funds within the same categories. It is possible to find funds with higher yields in other Lipper Categories. They usually have an Aggressive or Very Aggressive MFO Risk Rank, usually accompanied by below-average risk-adjusted performance as measured by MFO Rank, and often with very high expenses.

Title: 'Opportunity for investors' as Trump's tariffs spark uncertainty for corporate Australia

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN The Business Topic:Company News Donald Trump's trade tariffs are a major source of uncertainty for markets. (Reuters: Brian Snyder) The next few weeks could end up being more exciting (or nerve-racking) than usual for people who've poured their money into the share market. Hundreds of Australian companies — from the Commonwealth Bank to Woolworths — will reveal how much money they have earned (or lost) over the past six to 12 months, as the biannual reporting season unfolds. There is no doubt company chief executives will be peppered with questions about what the future holds. But the problem is it might be hard for these highly paid bosses to provide much guidance, particularly with the unpredictability coming from the White House. Many had thought that Donald Trump's long-standing threats to introduce tariffs against America's biggest trading partners were a negotiation tactic. So the US President's decision to actually start a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China caught many by surprise — as evidenced by the hefty falls across global share markets, and the Australian dollar sinking to a five-year low. "I think in the short term, the implications are significant," said Gemma Dale, head of investor behaviour at NabTrade. Gemma Dale says there's a risk of tech stocks reporting disappointing results. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "The risk is that Trump is not as predictable as previous [US] administrations have been, so it's very difficult to make predictions about how the market is going perform for the rest of the year, given he's already shocked us multiple times in the past week or two." However, there are some fund managers who are feeling optimistic about the markets, despite the volatility that Mr Trump has unleashed with his tariff announcements. Tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump may not be a surprise, but they've certainly caused a shock on financial markets. Analysts say correction (a decline of of at least 10 per cent from the previous peak) on equity markets is now looking more likely. "At the moment, it's very hard to see the real long-term impact, and it's too early to even be thinking about the secondary impacts on inflation," said Jun Bei Liu, lead portfolio manager at Ten Cap. "That's because he [Trump] imposed this very quickly, and he's given himself time to change his mind. "I think this creates a lot of opportunity for investors, for some of the higher-quality companies if they get sold off." Although resource stocks are expected to come under pressure — due to their exposure to China's economy — Ms Liu believes the overall share market will keep rising for the rest of the year as interest rates start to fall in Australia. Jun Bei Liu expects the ASX to perform well this year despite the risks. (ABC News: John Gunn) At this stage, money markets are betting there is a 96 per cent chance of the Reserve Bank slashing interest rates at its 17-18 February meeting, followed by two more cuts by Christmas. And in a rare display of unanimity, economists from the "big four" banks (CBA, Westpac, NAB and ANZ) are predicting the RBA will announce that eagerly awaited rate reduction in two weeks. These coming weeks will be a good opportunity for investors to work out how well companies are performing — and whether they are paying too much for their shares. Despite Monday's tumble, the local share market is still trading near record highs. In general, if a company's results (and guidance about future profits) is better than expected, it leads to more people buying their stock — which drives up the share price. But if their results fall below what market analysts are expecting, it can lead to a sell-off for the company in more extreme cases. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some of the common jargon and has a calendar of all the key dates. "One of the key questions for investors will be, Is there going to be earnings growth for the Australian share market?'" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell. "And that's important because valuations are relatively high. "If we look at what happened in 2024, we actually saw earnings going backwards by about 4 per cent, and yet the Australian share market grew by 7.5 per cent. "That's not a sustainable trend when you're paying high multiples and high valuations." Ms Lee said shareholders wanted to see the companies they were invested in growing, which meant the lack of earnings growth was a problem. "This reporting season it will be all about whether we see upgrades to the outlook to help support those lofty valuations that we're seeing here on the Australian market." Julia Lee says gold miners may benefit from trade uncertainty. (The Business) Here is a table showing the price-to-earnings ratios of the ASX 200, and the various sectors which make up the share market (from most expensive to cheapest): At the upper end of the spectrum, people have been willing to pay high amounts of money (a share price 146.8 times the current earnings per share) for shares in local tech companies — as they have lofty expectations those businesses will develop new products and grow their profits rapidly in the future. On the flip side, a sharp fall in commodity prices last year have led to shares of BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside Energy and similar companies tumbling. Their profits are determined largely by how much their iron ore, oil, nickel and lithium can be sold for. So that is why the price-to-earnings ratios for the energy (11.2x) and materials (13.7x) sectors are lower compared to the broader market (19.9x). "There's a handful of companies in Australia where the price-to-earnings ratio is just extraordinarily high," Ms Dale said. Mexico and Canada have vowed to impose their own taxes on billions of dollars of trade with their closest neighbour. "You'd want to look very closely at the tech sector, in particular, where you've got companies like WiseTech Global and Xero on P/Es of more than 115 times. So those are very, very rich valuations. "They've grown very quickly and they continue to surprise to the upside generally. "But when you've got companies that are priced so well, and you're expecting that kind of dramatic growth quite a long way into the future, if there's any surprise — even if it's only marginally negative — or they don't live up to expectations, you can see a real, quite dramatic price response to that can be really disappointing." Australian banks are also looking quite expensive by this measure (with CBA commanding a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8x). "Investors don't mind paying up as long as they get that [earnings] growth," Ms Lee said. "However, if we have a look at the banks' cash profits, they're forecast to contract 2 per cent [this year], which is a consensus view, and contract by another 1 per cent next year. "So the earnings outlook does look more difficult. And we know that people are doing it tough, paying off mortgages, so asset quality also comes into the picture as well." The three analysts and fund managers we spoke to revealed what they were watching in the February reporting season. Here are some of the trends they are looking out for: CBA is the world's most expensive bank, on its price to earnings ratio. (ABC News: Christopher Gillette) The biggest risk that most analysts are worried about is the uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's policies — and the extent to which countries retaliate against US tariffs. With widespread tariffs (in a worst-case scenario), it could lead to the price of consumer goods becoming a lot more expensive across the globe, which could lead to inflation rising again (or not falling as quickly). That could lead to central banks (such as the RBA, US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank) announcing fewer rate cuts than had been expected. That would likely lead to the stock market, which was expecting rate cuts, to suffer heavy falls or even a correction — that is, a fall of at least 10 per cent from its most recent peak. "If inflation picks up again, and if we have interest rates moving higher, then it will challenge the investment thesis, making a lot of businesses and retailers struggle," Ms Liu said, adding the odds of that happening were low. "Consumers will falter and corporate earnings would struggle. "That is probably one of the biggest potential risks to the market." Disclaimer: This article is not intended as investment advice.

Title: Apple in 2024: The complete commentary

Time Published: 2025-02-03T20:07:01Z

February 3, 2025 12:07 PM PT Every year we ask a collection of writers, editors, developers, podcasters, and other people for their opinions about how Apple fared in the year just gone by. You can read our 2024 report card for the average scores and some juicy quotes. But if you want to read the whole thing—all 32,000 words of it—who are we to stand in your way? They wrote it, you read it. That’s how this works. Onward. How would you rate how the Mac platform went in 2024? Consider new Mac models, new chips, new macOS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Eric Linder: I have an M1 MacBook Pro, and the M4 looks delicious, but I’m going to wait one more year. I don’t have a vote per se, but I do like that Apple is updating the Mac lineup on a much more regular basis than in previous “times.” Benjamin Mayo: The M4 chip continues to show Apple’s silicon supremacy, posting impressive year-over-year gains. I was particularly glad to see the M4 Pro chip core configuration pivot away from last year’s weirdness and return to a beefy performance-tuned chip. The Mac mini got its long-deserved time in the sun with a nice update and chassis redesign, alongside decent spec bumps for the iMac and MacBook Pro. Also, a really welcome surprise was the bump to 16 GB RAM as the base spec for all models, including the ‘old but still sold’ M2 and M3 Airs. As far as macOS is concerned, I use iPhone Mirroring a lot and found it to be a stable and enjoyable affair. Roman Loyola: It sure feels like Apple took the criticism of the base M3 MacBook Pro to heart, and that’s why Apple made the changes it did, but I guess we’ll never know. Regardless, the upgrades were very satisfying. Glenn Fleishman: Apple keeps ticking over with new processors and models filling out and updating their matrix. Generally, they are delivering solid, often exceptional performance per dollar. In a year with both M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro updates and M4 and M4 Pro Mac minis in a new form factor, it’s hard to pick too many nits. But I think the iMac is way overdue for a 27-inch model, the Mac Studio lacked a refresh, and I have no idea what the company thinks the Mac Pro is for. I wish I could split Mac into two categories: how well are they keeping things going (such as finally removing the 8 GB low-end configuration), and how well they are introducing new features and form factors that are in demand (like the cuteness but also power and utility of the new Mac mini). I can’t give Apple a five on hardware for those reasons, but I also think macOS is at a point of confusion. The introduction of Apple Intelligence in waves and without having tentpole features that solve problems (across all platforms) is absolutely mystifying. I have new-enough Macs to take advantage of all AI features and I honestly find them mostly useful. Apple even replaced a perfectly good touch-up feature in Photos for macOS with an AI-based one that has worse performance and is in beta. This removed functionality people relied on. However, I’m a huge fan of a probably uncovered set of features I’ve written about in my books: screen mirroring and sharing. It’s dramatically better in every direction. Screen Sharing between Macs now works reliably for me; with iPhones and iPads, there’s a new and better approach; Mac to Apple TV offers more options and is far superior; Mac into videoconferencing, particularly FaceTime, much better; and the iPhone Mirroring app is a big bonus integration. Screen sharing/mirroring are boring areas that some people use intensively and others not at all; Apple’s improvements show that they can pay attention to the little things and provide integrated, upgraded, seamless OS features! Eric Slivka: The Mac mini redesign is a treat, while the overdue bump to 16GB of memory across the board was very welcome. Otherwise, nice to see the steady chip progression, though some will undoubtedly be disappointed at the higher-end machines skipping the M3 generation. macOS Sequoia has some nice improvements, though it has had a few hiccups along the way, and we’re still waiting on some of the promised features amid Apple’s gradual rollout. Brett Terpstra: The M4 lineup is top-notch. I’ve been using an M1 Studio for a while now, and moving up to the M4 was a bigger performance leap than I expected. I’m anxious to see the Studio lineup get upgraded, but the M4 Mac mini has an amazing bang/buck ratio, and the M4 MacBook Pro has me very satisfied with my purchase. Dave Hamilton: Great to see the MacBook Air get the M3 chip and continue to see love from Apple. I also love that the MacBook Air has become the default model for so many people, including professionals. Folks seem to have (finally?) accepted that it’s not only OK to live in a world of dongles, but it’s better because we each get to choose the ports that matter where they matter. Need one thing at your desk but different options when you travel? Great! You’ve got it. Also nice to see the “Pro” machines (iMac and MacBook Pro) get the M4 chip where it’s needed. I’ve (finally?) gotten over the fact that Apple won’t be making iMacs with screens large enough for me to use on a daily basis, but ViewSonic’s soon-to-be-released 27″ 5K Thunderbolt Display is an easy, $799 solution to that problem when paired with the new Mac mini, which is definitely the lede I’ve buried here. That thing is a beast and is the right computer for so many people who work on their Macs at their desks. What a fantastic upgrade! David Sparks: Apple Silicon Macs remain some of the best hardware Apple is shipping. I’m satisfied with the pace of improvement and the product line as a whole. If, however, I was someone at that top end of the performance curve, I’d be sad. I can’t help but feel there is an alternative universe where the Mac Pro has a chip that is so fast that it comes with a warning label—just not this one. Lex Friedman: I want every new Mac. Apple is crushing it with the Mac. I can’t believe how great every new Mac is. I feel like a fanboy when I write these words, but seriously, the state of the Mac today is exceptional. Craig Hockenberry: Here’s the thing: over the years, I’ve become less eager to upgrade my Macs to the latest version of macOS. I’m still using Sonoma on all my Macs and will only move to the new version when I’m forced to by a system requirement (that’s most likely to be Xcode). The main cause for lagging behind is all of the annoyances that come with each new version. I’m really tired of all the new security prompts, odd bugs from incomplete testing, and UI weirdness from designers and developers whose primary focus is iOS. It’s a shame the software is in this state because the Mac hardware has never been better. My MacBook Air is the best computer I have ever owned, and the whole product lineup is great (yes, even with the outrageous incremental costs for storage and memory). Marco Arment: It’s a great time to be a Mac user. The hardware is the best it has ever been, with nearly every need met with multiple great choices. macOS remains mostly good, due largely to neglect, but that’s better than today’s Apple touching it very much. Myke Hurley: The M4 was a really nice continued advancement of the power behind the Mac line. We got great laptop updates and a welcome simplification for the MacBook Air. However it would have been nice to get some clarity over the future of the Mac Studio. Matt Deatherage: The low end sees massive improvements, but the high desktop end seems more than ever like a status item for the one percent. Kirk McElhearn: A solid year for Macs, with M4 processors across much of the line and the attractive new Mac mini. This said, with the exception of the Mac mini, there’s no real innovation in new Macs; they’re all just upgrades of previous models. Maybe we don’t need anything different? But where is the Mac Pro, and what about a larger iMac? I don’t want one—I’m happy with the 24″—but I know many people who do. The lack of an upgrade to the Studio Display is a bit surprising, and Apple seems to have, once again, given up on caring about displays. The bump to 16 GB on all new Macs at no price increase underscores the fact that this extra memory is not worth $200, and is a reminder that we have been paying this Apple tax for years, since we can’t add RAM to Macs anymore. Stephen Hackett: As we round out the fourth year of the Apple Silicon Era, the Mac is truly firing on all cylinders. Modern Mac notebooks are incredible; even my new M4 Max 14-inch MacBook Pro runs silently and boasts shockingly good battery life. While I could have never had a notebook-only setup during the Intel days, I’ve done just that for several years with no complaints. The one ding on the hardware front is that the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are stuck on M2-based SoCs. It’s clear that the process used for the M3 was a bit of a dead-end and that an M3 Ultra wasn’t in the cards, but Apple’s two high-end desktops using old silicon is a bit embarrassing. On the software front, macOS Sequoia brought my favorite macOS feature in years, which was the iPhone Mirroring. I use it daily to access iPhone-only apps while sitting at my desk. I’m thrilled that Apple continues to find new ways to tighten the integration between the Mac and the iPhone without turning the former into the latter. Peter Cohen: I’d never have picked the M4 Mac mini to be the MVP, but it’s like the Genie from Aladdin: PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER! (Itty bitty living space.) Chance Miller: It’s pretty hard to complain about the Mac these days. The new Mac mini is another example of Apple flexing its design muscles in the Apple silicon era. The biggest change of the year, however, was Apple doubling the RAM in the base MacBook Air from 8GB to 16 GB. Bonus points for not raising the price and backdating the change to the M2 configuration as well. My only complaint semi-related to the Mac? We need new external display options. It’s time, Apple. Brent Simmons: The Current Mac UI design—both in terms of how it works and how it looks—could be improved. Nick Heer: The farther down you look on the Mac price list in 2024, the better the year was. The new Mac Mini is a tremendous value, as is the Walmart-exclusive M1 MacBook Air. Every Mac sold by Apple now has a (long-overdue) baseline of 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. As prices increase, though, the Mac is more of a mixed bag. The MacBook Air did not get Apple’s latest architecture despite updates to the Mac Mini and iMac, which share the same core parts. The MacBook Pro was updated, but the Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and Apple’s displays were not. MacOS Sequoia is fine. iPhone Screen Mirroring is useful, but Apple Intelligence is a mixed bag. Why is Writing Tools in an easy-to-accidentally-dismiss popover? Notifications are still buggy, and security prompts are out of control. Federico Viticci: Look, as we’ve established, I can now use my iPad Pro for everything I do and don’t need a Mac in my life. But I think Apple is doing an outstanding job with its Mac lineup, and I’m particularly envious of those who own the new Mac mini, which is small, powerful, and just exceedingly cute. I would give this category five stars; I don’t because Apple still insists on not making touchscreen Macs or more interesting and weird form factors. Shelly Brisbin: Apple’s Mac updates this year were solid but also satisfying. The ease with which M4 versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac entered the lineup says a lot about how well Apple’s hardware designs can carry forward for multiple years but leave room for the kind of performance improvements enthusiasts expect. The new Mac mini, though fans of the diminutive form factor impatiently anticipated it, was a big hit when it arrived, bringing plenty of power – and value – in a solid hardware package. More M4s are coming in 2025, surely. From a fan’s perspective, I enjoy the gradual, dare I say, thoughtful pace of updates. Rich Mogull: Between chip updates and the new Mac mini, Apple is firing on all cylinders. Michael Tsai: The M4 Macs have some virtualization, display, and USB issues, but overall the updates seem seem strong. I’m particularly excited about the MacBook Pro’s nanotexture display. The Mac input devices are finally USB-C, but they got the most minimal of updates, not fixing the Magic Mouse’s charging point or modernizing the globe key’s location on the extended keyboard. Unfortunately, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro are still using M2 processors. SSD pricing is still ridiculous, and the software side is still a mess, both in terms of reliability and design. I have not found the Apple Intelligence features very useful. Probably the most exciting things for me in Sequoia are the new Passwords app and the new window management features, though in both cases I prefer third-party solutions. Dan Moren: Look, the Mac continues to have one of its best runs ever. Apple redesigned the Mac mini (the Mac mini!) for the first time in almost fifteen years, making it even smaller and putting ports on the front—a home run. If the Mac suffers from anything these days, it’s that the hardware seems so good that it’s hard to imagine how Apple can continue to improve it. Jeff Carlson: The Mac lineup seemed to find a groove and stick to it in 2024. Aside from the smaller size and greater power of the Mac mini, it’s felt like a transition to bigger, later things, especially at the high end. In fact, I’d say Apple has hobbled itself slightly with the M-series processors, particularly from a consumer point of view: the MacBook Pro has an M4, but the Mac Studio and Mac Pro still have an M2. Yes, there are Maxes and Ultras, and likely, the person buying those machines knows the differences, but it’s still not as solid of a pitch as Apple can do. All that said, the Mac remains solid. Casey Liss: There is nearly nothing to complain about with the Mac — when it comes to regular people, anyway. The new Mac mini is adorable, powerful, and affordable. The laptops remain incredible; the Air is great for most people and, for Apple, affordable. The MacBook Pro is overkill for many, but it remains a truly phenomenal machine. Several years into the Apple Silicon transition, I am still amazed I can have the modern equivalent of iMac Pro performance in a machine that I can easily carry with me, and use without being connected to power for hours. Arguably, the one indisputably great thing to come from Apple Intelligence is the VERY, VERY LONG, OVERDUE increase in RAM across the Mac lineup. Andy Ihnatko: The Mac lineup feels like an impressive, cohesive “collection” now (to dip back into my “Project Runway” super fandom days). I’m going to single out the Mac Mini for special love. The cheapest ticket to the Mac lineup is a perfect introduction to everything Apple does well. Howard Oakley: Generally a very good year, with some great highlights, and relatively few gaffes. James Thomson: The new Mac mini is delightful, though definitely not cheap at higher specs. More niche hardware like the Mac Studio still hasn’t seen any updates in a while. Adam Engst: The M4 Macs are brilliant. John Gruber: The Macs that Apple is shipping are better than ever. The most popular Mac models, by far, are the laptops, and both the MacBook Pro and Air lineups had good years, and now, even better, seem to be on regular annual upgrade schedules: MacBook Pros in the fall, MacBook Airs in the spring. I am especially pleased—borderline ecstatic—regarding the new nano-texture (matte) display option now available on MacBook Pros for $150. (They don’t even charge more for the option on the larger 16-inch models.) The only hitch in the lineup is the Macs Apple hasn’t been shipping: the Mac Studio and Mac Pro have remained unchanged since 2023, when the M2 models debuted. My presumption/hunch is they skipped the M3 generation for engineering reasons pertaining to TSMC’s first-generation 3nm process and will be back on track in 2025 with new M4-generation models around WWDC. MacOS 15 Sequoia, like 14 Sonoma and 13 Ventura before it, is a fine release. Reliable and familiar. Jessica Dennis: One wonders what Apple could have been doing instead of spending person-hours building a bunch of AI stuff that doesn’t seem particularly good or useful into MacOS. Mac hardware quality continues to be excellent, and lucky for me, I fall into one of the well-supported niches (i.e., I buy a new laptop every five years or so, and it’s fine). However, I’ve definitely seen the genuine angst some folks have about product upgrade cycles. Michael Gartenberg: The Mac has been pretty stable, and that’s not a bad thing; the M series of processors has delivered well for users. Unfortunately, for many users, there’s no reason to upgrade from their M1 or M2 to jump on the latest devices. The new Mac mini is a great device but creates confusion in the line relative to devices like the Studio devices, making it challenging for high-end users to figure out what devices are for them. Apple also finally acknowledges that perhaps 8 GB of RAM isn’t enough for users, which is good because Apple’s prices for both RAM and storage upgrades are absurd. Apple either needs to find a new supplier for memory and storage, make these things upgradeable, or stop gouging customers. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Silicon continued to be the purchase driver for the Mac. Market share in Enterprise is growing, offering Apple a new opportunity to penetrate a space that has mostly been BYOD in the past. The broad range of price points and computing power offers Apple the ability to have a low entry point and go all the way to a workstation competitor. Christina Warren: Man. What a great year for the Mac. Four years on, Apple silicon continues to impress. The much-touted Apple Intelligence might be a bust, but it forced Apple to finally give every Mac 16GB of RAM. RAM and storage upgrade pricing continue to be war crimes — but at least every Mac has 16GB of RAM now. The base model M4 Mac mini is one of the most compelling and best-value Apple products we’ve seen, probably since the venerable M1 MacBook Air. I wish it had more storage, but it shows that Apple can actually offer a compelling product priced under the competition for its performance. The MacBook Air would’ve been a push update for me but then Apple had to up the RAM even in the M2 models for the Apple Intelligence launch. I got a great deal on a 13″ M3 with 16GB of RAM for my mom that wipes the floor with anything priced that way in Windows Land — x86 or Qualcomm. The M4 chips look like real winners. I won’t be replacing my maxed-out 2023 14″ M3 Max, but I hope we get a Mac Studio this spring so I can harness some of that power. The Studio and the Mac Pro are the unloved children. But that’s fine. As a desktop devotee, even I’ve accepted that Apple is a notebook company that occasionally makes desktops and, about once a decade, releases a mini PC so compelling that it’ll act as my home server for the next decade. macOS is not as good as it used to be. I hate the new UAC stuff for screen capture, and the settings menu is the worst. But compared to our friends in Windows land (to say nothing of our Linux compatriots, steam notwithstanding) dealing with Recall drama, it’s a good time to be a Mac user. And as Simon Willison noted, Apple Intelligence might be hot garbage (OK, I editorialized the hot garbage bit), but MLX is great. And despite Nvidia being a behemoth, Apple machines are great for doing local AI development. It was just an unbelievable year for the Mac. Andrew Laurence: The M4 generation looks to be one of leveling up across the product line. More like this, please. Zac Hall: Good riddance, 8GB RAM. You simply don’t have enough memory to be missed. Matt Birchler: It might be too bold, but I wonder if the Mac lineup is as good as it’s ever been in Apple’s history. Name a bad computer in the lineup; I don’t think you can. Exciting new form factors would be great to see, and macOS could always improve, but if we don’t call the Mac great right now, then I don’t know when it will be great. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: The M4 line of chips feels like the first justifiable upgrade opportunity for those who jumped in with the M1. Where the M2 and M3 were decent but still just incremental upgrades, the M4 is a powerhouse. I’m disappointed that the black MacBook Pro is not a true black, but that’s truly petty given that there still doesn’t seem to be any other computer that comes close to offering the Mac’s astonishing quality, performance, and power, not to mention that it still beats everything else for style and convenience. The dark days of the Mac seem to be a fading memory now. Long may this continue. Allison Sheridan: Who would have thought the Mac mini would lead the excitement for 2024 with the M4 Pro? The other across-the-board advancement was making all entry-level Macs come with 16GB/256GG, which was a win all around. Brian Mattucci: While the migration to M4 is going as expected, and the Mac Mini redesign is a positive, the long wait for the Mac Studio with the latest Apple silicon continues to feel illogical when the model they’re selling is now two generations behind and will likely be nearly three generations behind by the time they finally update it. Quinn Nelson: The M4 took everyone by surprise. From its unexpected debut on the iPad to delivering process gains far beyond expectations, it was hands-down Apple’s star of 2024. And the new Mac mini? Seriously—how could you not love it? Adorable! Paul Kafasis: Mac hardware is really looking good, with frequent updates. MacOS updates have been good, though there’s a lot of churn going on, and features coming in 15.1, 15.2, and beyond, is somewhat bothersome. Can Apple get off of the annual OS update cycle yet? John Siracusa: The M4 chip series is the best since the M1. The single-core performance and power efficiency are both great, which is important for the low-core-count M-series chips that most people buy. The uncertainty surrounding the “big” desktop Macs and the chips that will power them continues to be a problem, however. I was happy to see the base RAM in Macs increase to 16 GB this year. Call it the Apple Intelligence Dividend. Ironically, this is also the year that Apple’s absurdly high pricing for RAM and storage upgrades—which definitely continued in 2024—has gotten a bit more widespread attention. I’m not sure if it will change anything, but something has to give. Consider the new M4 Mac mini. It’s impossible to build a PC that is as powerful as the base M4 mini for the same amount of money. But as soon as you add any kind of upgrade from the base specs, the M4 mini completely loses its value lead—often by a lot. I’ve calculated that Apple’s storage upgrades are now 6.5x higher than retail market prices for the same size and performance. Ridiculous. Philip Michaels: The move to Apple silicon continues to pay dividends. It’s probably the smartest thing Apple’s done in years. Steven Aquino: I feel like the Mac is firing on all cylinders right now, thanks in large part to Apple silicon. While my daily driver machine is a 2019 Retina 4K iMac on Intel—I do have an M2 MacBook Air as well—the value proposition is off the charts, seeing it still going strong nearly 6 years after I bought it. How would you rate how the iPhone and iOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Paul Kafasis: The iPhone seems strong, and iOS 18 had some good updates. Interestingly, though, this is the first year since 2008 that I didn’t get a new iPhone. The hardware update just wasn’t that compelling to me, in part because my iPhone 15 Pro is Apple Intelligence compatible. David Sparks: The iPhone is what it needs to be: a solid platform that sells billions of units per year. However, I wish Apple had continued the mini for folks who prefer something smaller. I’d also like to see them take a few more risks with a non-flagship model, which may be the aim of the rumored iPhone Air. But if the rumors are true, it doesn’t sound like a big enough risk to me. Casey Liss: I could have made a case for a five, but for this year, I think four is more appropriate. While I mostly like the Camera Control, I think it’s too fiddly by half. A few months in, I suspect I would have preferred a dumb shutter button to the fancy touch-sensitive setup that we actually got. I am overjoyed to return to a human-sized phone from the 15 Pro Max I had last year, but even the regular-sized phones are large enough that I didn’t give up my PopSocket—#mykewasright. I’m also getting sick and tired of the Pro phones having absurdly boring colors. Apple, it won’t take away from the other Pro models to have fun colors. Offer the boring ones of today, as well as some fun ones… PLEASE! The non-Pro colors are SO GOOD this year; I’d probably pay a bit more to have that blue in a Pro phone. Marco Arment: iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 family are almost universally great. My only (minor) complaint is the Camera Control button, an overthought, finicky, error-prone engineering indulgence that actually can be pretty useful, but only once most of its functionality is turned off. Benjamin Mayo: Apple delivered about as much as you can reasonably expect for an ‘iteration’ year of the iPhone. The base models represent really good value this year, with only a couple of minor details separating them from the Pro lines. I think the Camera Control was a bit of a miss; it’s fine as a shutter button, but all of the gestural stuff feels like a gimmick, given its current implementation. The sheer number of settings to change its behavior is laughable and perhaps speaks to a need for Apple to give it a second look and strip it back to what is really most useful. Apple Intelligence may still be rolling out in a piecemeal fashion, but I find features like the email summaries and improved photo search to meaningfully improve the iOS experience. Jessica Dennis: The iPhone continues to be solidly Good, if unexciting. Apple may have been shocked that no one was particularly interested in upgrading their phone just for the new Apple Intelligence features, but very few other people were (myself included). I get a new phone annually because of the Apple Upgrade program, and that’s the only reason. For the past couple of years, I haven’t had a use case for a Pro model. And I miss the iPhone Mini so much. Dave Hamilton: I was stoked that Apple Intelligence essentially forced Apple to make the base model iPhone 16 almost as powerful as the iPhone 16 Pro. This truly gives people options and, of course, allows everyone getting a new iPhone this year to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. Adam Engst: Having the Action button and Camera Control on all iPhone 16 models is great, but otherwise, the iPhone 16 lineup doesn’t seem to be much of an improvement over previous models. And while I know it’s boring to complain about the lack of a smaller iPhone, I also field non-stop complaints from people who want one and aren’t upgrading from the iPhone SE because of that. Rich Mogull: The iPhone 16 and 16 Pro are solid updates, and the non-Pro has really stepped up the value proposition. I’m mixed on the new Camera Control; even though I use it a lot for zoom, I still don’t have a good handle on making it work like I want. The response is just a bit off. iOS 18 is a good start, but Apple Intelligence isn’t quite there yet. Maybe in 18.4. John Gruber: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Nothing has been broke regarding the iPhone lineup, and Apple hasn’t tried to fix anything. This is good. Changes for the sake of change are the surest sign of a company in decline. Stagnation and hubris are concerns for any wildly successful product, but it takes confidence to let great design speak for itself without making facile, unnecessary changes. Camera Control is the big new hardware change in the iPhone 16 generation, and while I’d like to see the actual button improve (I think it’s too hard to press), in practice I make frequent use of it. I spent some time back on an iPhone 15 over the holidays, and I instantly missed having a Camera Control button to launch the Camera app. Kudos to Apple for bringing Camera Control to the entire iPhone 16 lineup, not just the Pro models. iOS 18 is refined, mature, and familiar. Joe Rosensteel: The hardware is the best iPhone hardware they’ve ever shipped. The software promises Apple is making around Apple Intelligence aren’t compelling, and Apple didn’t deliver on them in 2024. Camera Control is a mess, but it doesn’t impair phone usage. People should really take a step back and think through the headline features because they were anything but. The new, editable Photographic Styles have had a bigger impact on my life than any other 2024 feature. Michael Gartenberg: Someone at Apple forgot that it’s _under_promise and _over_deliver, not the other way around. iPhone 16 was sold on the basis of Apple Intelligence, which wasn’t present at the launch, it took two releases to bring some of the promised features, and when they failed, Apple removed them as opposed to fixing them. Siri remains far behind Google and Samsung in terms of AI features that actually do something. The good news is iPhone 15 users don’t feel nearly as bad for not getting Apple AI on their devices, and they can use things like Gemini or Copilot for their AI fix. I do give them credit, as they promised a glow effect and delivered on that rather nicely. I am not a fan of the camera button. It feels like it’s in the wrong place, and it’s kind of hard for me to use; the volume button works fine for me. I was kind of baffled when Tim said that email summaries were a game changer for him, making me wonder if he gets very little email or uses some other AI for his email summaries. Matt Birchler: The iPhone is still the best phone for me, but 2024 definitely felt like an off year to me. I think the iPhone 16 is a good update, but the 16 Pro line is a real miss in my book. I’d actually pay more to get a 16 Pro that didn’t have the Camera Control button because it’s turned into a button that I exclusively use on accident and never on purpose. I still use the Action Button to launch and use my camera because it feels better to me. Also, Apple Intelligence really put a stink on this whole year for the iPhone, as seemingly very few other software features were added, and the few Apple Intelligence features we’ve gotten have arrived later than hoped for and have been almost universally underwhelming. Andy Ihnatko: The iPhone 16 is the same old dish, prepared with fresh ingredients. That’s all that Apple was prepared to release this year. It’s fine: a solid 3/5. I have to deduct a full point for Apple Intelligence. Most of these features are as squirrelly as everybody should have expected: no more, no less. I expect Apple Intelligence to improve after this first round of users provides a galaxy of training data. But Apple chose to roll these features into the mainstream iPhone OS and promote them as if they were finished features, so I have to factor that in. Carolina Milanesi: Solid hardware, but Apple Intelligence was a bit of a letdown. Brian Mattucci: 2024 was all about the slow trickle of Apple Intelligence features of uncertain value. Some features (Image Playground and especially Genmoji) were interesting at first, but they feel like they’re years away from being reliable and useful. I was a big fan of notification summaries at first, but I’ve seen enough errors at this point to no longer trust them. I turned off the mail categorization feature almost immediately. I love the Home Screen and Control Center customization options – they’re the highlights of iOS 18 for me. As for hardware, adding the camera control button makes some sense, though I don’t use any of the features beyond launching the Camera app – it just doesn’t feel precise enough. Eric Linder: The iPhone is a fully mature product at this point, and sometimes, I struggle to think of new features that might be implemented. One criticism I have is that Apple seems to continue to sell the iPhone 16 line based on the promises of future features (I’m looking at you, not-so-intelligent-Apple-Intelligence). Even when the iPhone 16 was launched, commercials seemed to appear everywhere that used Siri app intents and context awareness, both of which are STILL not available even to iOS 18.3 beta users. Roman Loyola: I usually upgrade to a Pro Max, but this time, I opted for the 16 Plus, and I’m happy with it. Until I start making “cinema,” I may not get a Pro phone again. Steven Aquino: The iPhone impresses every year in my eyes. I upgrade it every year not merely for journalism’s sake but because it’s my most important and oft-used computer. Jeff Carlson: I want to give this a 3.5 because overall, the iPhone is in good shape; the 16 series is good, but despite the technological complexity and ingenuity of the Camera Control on the 16 Pro, in practice, it just doesn’t work as well as it should. It’s too finicky and, most important, often doesn’t do what you expect it to do. Dr. Drang: The Camera Control is possibly the worst Apple UI device since the hockey puck mouse. There’s a reason no real camera manufacturer recesses their shutter button. Depressing a recessed button is a recipe for both shaking (as you’ve complained about) and tilting. Worse is how the photographic styles shift for seemingly no reason. I know I must be sliding my finger on the button, but I’m trying not to. It’s too sensitive and keeps making changes I don’t want. I should say “kept” instead of “keeps.” I’ve changed the Camera Control to open Magnifier, and I now use the Acton button to open the Camera. It’s much less frustrating. Dan Moren: The iPhone is great and continues to be great. But this year’s focus on Apple Intelligence is disappointing and sucked a lot of the air out of the room when it came to actual feature improvements that people want. I still use Camera Control, but I think a lot of its extra features, beyond opening/taking pictures and video, are clunky and not useful. It feels a bit like the company is struggling to find opportunities to improve what has become an increasingly mature product category. Eric Slivka: The iterative updates continue as we wait for some bolder changes from Apple. I love the colors on this year’s standard iPhones but I continue to hope for some better options on the Pro side. I’ve struggled and failed to embrace Camera Control, and even in the second year for Pro users, I’ve not found a lot of value in the Action button. On the software side, Apple Intelligence is obviously the big thing, but we’re only barely dipping our toes into it so far. The verdict is yet to come, but so far, it’s been underwhelming. Craig Hockenberry: Apple Intelligence is underwhelming, especially with Siri. It also feels like a lot of engineering resources were directed toward features that no one asked for and can’t really trust. But again, the hardware is stellar. And the “intelligence” does have an upside: more memory in our pockets. Kirk McElhearn: It’s all about Apple Intelligence this year, and limiting these features to only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models feels like an attempt to force a super cycle, which doesn’t seem to be occurring. I upgraded from an iPhone 14 Pro, and honestly feel that I could have kept my 14 a year longer. I’ve heard from plenty of non-tech people that they simply don’t care about Apple Intelligence, and they see no need to upgrade phones that work just fine. Shelly Brisbin: Like the Mac, the iPhone platform moved ahead incrementally in 2024 if evaluated year-over-year. But the base on which this year’s updates stand is solid enough to offer tempting upgrades to almost anyone who has kept their phone for more than a year. I feel good about the division of features between Pro and non-Pro phones. If an advanced camera system is irresistible, you can have it. But bringing hardware features like the Action Button and Dynamic Island to the full line of new phones is friendly to all kinds of users. The most disappointing aspect of this year’s phones is Camera Control, which attempts to pack a lot of punch into one hardware button but remains confusing to use. iOS is frankly weighed down by the simultaneously glacial pace, and forcible implementation, of Apple Intelligence. From a business perspective, Apple had to build AI into its platforms this year, and the iPhone is where that’s unavoidably apparent. But there have been bugs and poorly implemented offerings, and despite the emphasis on Apple Intelligence in the ads, it’s unclear to me why a buyer would choose Apple’s version of AI over another. I like the tabby cat playing the guitar that I sent to my friend yesterday, but even he isn’t a killer iPhone app. Chance Miller: I tried really hard to use the Camera Control to its full potential with all the various swipe and half-press features. The reality is it’s most useful as a way to launch the Camera app and take a picture. Nothing more. Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro models are a stellar upgrade. The battery life continues to impress me on a daily basis. The non-Pro phones are more enticing than they’ve ever been. Oh, and RIP FineWoven. I wish Apple had replaced it with something better, but at least it’s dead. Federico Viticci: It’s been an interesting year in iPhone land for me. After the September event, I purchased an iPhone 16 Pro Max, but my mind kept going to the iPhone 16 Plus. I was fascinated by its color, slimmer form factor, and more affordable overall package. I used the iPhone 16 Plus as my primary phone for two months and loved it, but then something happened: much to my surprise, I realized that I wasn’t taking as many pictures of my dogs, friends, and family as I used to with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That’s when it hit me. I thought I wouldn’t need all the features of a “pro” phone – and, honestly, since I’m not a professional cinematographer, I really don’t – but in the end, I was missing the 5x camera too much. In my experience with using a 16 Plus, I was able to confirm that, if I wanted, I could live without a ProMotion display. But it was the lack of a third, zoomed camera on the Plus model that ultimately got me. I rely on the 5x lens to take dozens of pictures of my dogs doing something funny or sleeping in a cute way every day, and its absence on the 16 Plus was preventing me from grabbing my phone out of my pocket to save new memories on a daily basis. I’m glad I did this experiment because it also left me with a couple of additional thoughts about the iPhone line. First, if Apple comes out with a completely redesigned, slimmer “iPhone 17 Air” later this year that doesn’t have a 5x camera, I’ll have to begrudgingly pass on it and stick with the 17 Pro Max instead. Second, now more than ever, I truly, fundamentally want Apple to make a foldable phone that expands into a mini-tablet when opened. I don’t care how expensive Apple makes this device. I look at the latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I’m very jealous of its form factor, but I also know that I wouldn’t be able to use Android as the OS for my phone. If it weren’t for the lack of a foldable form factor in Apple’s iPhone lineup, I would give this category five stars. I hope we’ll see some changes on this front within the next couple of years. Michael Tsai: This is one of those years where the new iPhones seem fine, but I feel no urgency to upgrade from the previous model. The most interesting things to me are Photographic Styles and Camera Control. I’m hoping that the former will eventually let me reduce over-processing . The latter sounded promising but now seems more like the new Touch Bar: over-engineered and less useful than the basic Action button. iOS 18 adds a bunch of useful features. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues. James Thomson: Incremental updates, but still interesting. Stephen Hackett: By tightly bundling the iPhone, iOS, and the App Store, Apple has made it impossible to untangle the iPhone from Apple’s ongoing legal woes in the European Union and beyond. And by plastering the planet with rainbow-colored Apple Intelligence ads, Apple has wound the iPhone up very tightly with a group of features that weren’t even shipped when the iPhones launched last fall. That puts Apple’s most valued product in a slightly weird spot, but the Report Card demands answers, so let’s start with hardware. The iPhone 16 cycle brought Camera Control, an excellent bit of hardware engineering swamped with confusing software decisions. Learning to swipe, press, and click around the tiny UI can be confusing. With visual intelligence a press-and-hold away, it’s easy to be in the wrong mode entirely if you activate the button as you pull your iPhone out of your pocket. Apple has made it possible to simplify the Camera Control, boiling it down to a basic shutter button, but this requires delving into multiple sections across Settings. The Action button was added to the regular iPhone 16 models in 2024, and the 5x telephoto lens from the 15 Pro Max lives on in both the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro. Both are great changes, as is the move to a bolder color palette for the 16. However, 2024 was also the Year of Apple Intelligence. These loosely associated features run across various iPads and all Apple silicon Macs. However, Apple is marketing these features as a core component of its newest iPhones. That’s unfortunate, given how mediocre much of Apple Intelligence has proven to be so far. Apple’s writing tools are good, but nothing exceptional, and the UI is quite cramped on the iPhone. When it comes to image generation, Apple Intelligence shines with Genmoji, which is a genuinely fun feature, but it also falls on its face with Image Playgrounds. The images it creates are far behind the competition, and honestly, a race I wish Apple weren’t running. The company says it has gone to great lengths to build guard rails to keep Image Playgrounds from creating anything offensive or troubling, but it’s not hard to get it to create fictional images depicting some of history’s worst people. At least they look like cartoon characters, which is the best product choice Apple made here. The lack of photorealism may keep Image Playgrounds out of the headlines for making fake news, but Apple’s summarization of notifications has done just the opposite. From screwing up sports scores to re-writing breaking news alerts to say the opposite of the reporting, notifications summaries don’t seem ready for prime time. Apple hasn’t yet shipped the next generation of Siri either, which raises questions about Apple feeling rushed to get these features into the market. If it’s true, it’s an unusual place for Apple to be in, and I hope the company will not make the same mistake again. Zac Hall: Desert titanium and a dedicated camera button are nice. Nick Heer: While the flagship Pro model always makes the most noise among the kind of people who read pundits’ report cards about a tech company, the iPhone 16 should not be overlooked. Neither should iOS 18, which, even without considering Apple Intelligence, has solid updates to core apps I use every day and is more customizable. However, iOS remains buggier than I would like. I find interacting with the Dynamic Island and always-on display needlessly difficult, and Apple Intelligence is not very good yet. Andrew Laurence: This iPhone SE user looks forward to the next iteration of the iPhone’s value entry. Rosemary Orchard: I love the new camera button, but I feel it needs more automation possibilities Shahid Kamal Ahmad: Apple’s AI functionality feels like a rushed misstep. Most of us just don’t need what it offers, and the contortions to ring-fence access to OpenAI’s back end feel like the kind of thing Apple did when it apologetically added iTunes to a Motorola handset. Meanwhile, the hardware continues to be elegant, assuming what seems to be the definitive peak form factor for such a device. Incredibly, the 16 Pro Max feels less of a tank than previous models while still offering best-in-class performance and camera quality. After my iPhone mini 13, I didn’t think I’d upgrade. Now that I have, I don’t regret my purchase for a minute. This phone has all the performance required to deliver a class-leading UI responsiveness, and apart from the AI farce, a rollout that surely must be embarrassing for the executive team, it’s a device that does everything I need from a smartphone without ever breaking a sweat. It looks, feels and behaves like a premium product, but one where the UI could likely do with an overhaul to manage all the underlying complexity and features a little better. This complexity manifests in the form of additional buttons. It’s unusual for Apple to move so far away from the austerity of the Ive era, but perhaps with the addition of the camera button, they’ve made the UI more confusing than it needs to be. I keep forgetting that the button is there, and I sometimes activate it by accident, but can never seem to remember to use it when the need arises. This is to be expected, given that I’ve become so accustomed to the UI that’s been working well for so long. Philip Michaels: Phones are becoming commodities, and whatever will freshen up the platform AI in general and Apple Intelligence ain’t it right now Christina Warren: This is weird because, on the one hand, this is easily the most underwhelming iPhone Pro update I can recall in years and years. But the base model iPhone and iPhone Plus got some real juice. Apple Intelligence is still vaporware and nearly useless except for the ChatGPT integration, in my opinion, but I’m glad it forced Apple to up the RAM in the non-pro phones. But even though I genuinely have noticed nothing new on my iPhone 16 Pro Max compared to the 15 Pro Max, I think the base iPhone/iPhone Plus upgrades are really strong. It is too bad so many of the “features” of the phones are tied to software that might not land until mid 2025. Alex Cox: ust when the regular iPhone gets good enough for what most power users would want in a phone, the iPhone Pro is really pulling away from the smartphone pack in terms of actual professional use. Final Cut Camera with multi-camera support came out of left field and landed pleasantly into independent filmmakers’ laps. That said, when one needs to use multiple iPhones on multiple Apple IDs and then allow them to connect to another device running Final Cut Pro, it feels like Apple is trying to take it out of our laps. There needs to be a better way to manage and administer multiple phones as cameras when you’re a three-person company not brimming with enterprise-managed devices. Allison Sheridan: I’m going 5 again primarily because of the iPhone 16. They brought so many of the top-of-the-line features to the non-Pro phone, allowing people to make very few compromises to get a fantastic phone. Bringing 5X to the 16 Pro gave it feature parity with the Max, so there are no compromises between the two. Glenn Fleishman: Nothing stands out for me on the hardware side. As noted for macOS, I don’t find that AI serves a need. Siri on the iPhone seems marginally better. I use it a lot and feel like it can do more within iOS, but I still get weird transcription errors that seem like they should be overcome, and it fails to be able to do a lot. It often says, “You need to unlock your phone,” when my iPhone is unlocked already…and then Siri completes the task anyway. Peter Cohen: The 16 may be “built for Apple Intelligence,” but so what? Rob Griffiths: So far, at least, Apple AI has been a massive disappointment. I’ve found so little benefit from it that I’ve disabled it. In my work, at least, there’s absolutely no benefit to having it enabled. John Siracusa: My new iPhone 16 Pro has followed in the footsteps of its recent predecessors by being a bit better than the iPhone it replaced without adding any major regressions. My one frustration is the Camera Control. The button itself is fine, but most third-party case makers accommodated it by cutting a huge hole in the side of their cases, which I find awkward and uncomfortable. Only Apple and a handful of third-party case makers have included a pass-through button for the Camera Control, and none of those cases are to my liking. I hope more case makers offer pass-through buttons in 2025. Myke Hurley: I think if I were grading without my personal feelings, I would knock this down a bit. But switching from the Pro Max to the Pro this year has been a really lovely change. The new increased size of this phone has made it the perfect sweet spot for me. I am a fan of the Camera Control button, but I think the execution leaves a little to be desired. I think the swiping is too complicated, and the force needed to take photos is too strong. I look forward to this changing over time. I think that there was a lot more conversation in the broader community this year about the regular phone over the pro phone. This would indicate that Apple kinda missed the mark on the overall product mix. Quinn Nelson: On the one hand, we have the best update to the standard iPhone in years. On the other, we’re stuck with one of the buggiest, most feature-deprived versions of iOS in recent memory. How would you rate how the iPad and iPadOS platform went in 2024? Consider new hardware, new chips, OS versions, and anything else you deem relevant to the platform. Brian Mattucci: I love my M4 iPad Pro. The screen is beautiful, the thinner design makes it easier to hold, and it feels like a really refined device. As with iOS, the Home Screen and Control Center customization options are wonderful. While there are plenty of ambitious changes I would love to see on iPadOS, the product they’ve delivered is still one that I find essential. Matt Birchler: After the no-new-hardware year that was 2023, it was refreshing to get updates to almost all iPads in 2024. The new Pros are amazing devices that even got the privilege of introducing the M4 generation of chips; the Air got a boring but fine update, and the Mini got maybe the most subtle update of all. Sadly, software was on the back burner this year as the iPad got almost no new features outside of Apple Intelligence and a couple of minor things iOS also got. Craig Hockenberry: I still want to run macOS on an iPad. It’s so weird that I take a MacBook on trips when an iPad would be a better choice. Carolina Milanesi: iPad Pro was a solid upgrade, but some of the issues about software being able to elevate the device to a Mac level remain. Kirk McElhearn: This year, I upgraded from an M1 iPad Pro to the M4 model, which is a very nice if overpriced iPad. The M2 iPad Airs also look fine, and these two iPads offer Apple Intelligence features for those who care. The iPad mini upgrade seems a bit underwhelming, but Apple has never shown much love to that model. Federico Viticci: What can I say about the iPad that I haven’t already documented extensively? I love the iPad Pro’s hardware, and I find the M4 iPad Pro a miracle of hardware engineering with no equal in other similar products. In 2024, I chose to go all-in on the 11″ iPad Pro as my only computer; in fact, since the MacPad stopped working a few weeks ago (RIP), I don’t even have a Mac anymore, but I can do everything I need to do on an iPad – that is, after a series of compromises that, unfortunately, continue to be the other side of the coin of the iPad experience. Going into its 15th year (!), the iPad continues to be incredible hardware let down by a lackluster operating system that is neither as intuitive as iOS nor as advanced or flexible as macOS. The iPad is still stuck in the middle, which is exactly what I – and my fellow iPad users – have been saying for years now. I shouldn’t have to come up with expensive hardware-based workarounds to overcome the limitations of a platform that doesn’t want me to use my computer to its full extent. But, despite everything, I persist because no other tablet even comes close to the performance, thinness, and modularity of an iPad Pro. Dave Hamilton: I’m an iPad mini user (and fan!) and am stoked to see it continuing to get upgrades. That tells me enough people are buying these models to keep some of Apple’s attention. (Is this where we pour one out for the iPhone mini? Dang, I miss that thing!) Benjamin Mayo: The M4 iPad Pro is undeniably cool. The thinness and compactness of the design is remarkable, and it leaves a lasting impression. The screen is great, and the M4 chip is crazy fast, even in a 5.1mm thin fanless tablet form factor. That product is a momentous achievement. Unfortunately, iPadOS remains woefully underdeveloped. At the very least, I appreciated that the iPad software got the iOS 18 home screen customization features at the same time as the iPhone did, rather than it being a year behind as has happened in the past. Dan Moren: The iPad’s frustrations are eternal. Although the hardware is fantastic, the software feels increasingly left behind, limited, and, at times, downright clunky. Stage Manager hasn’t fixed the multitasking issue, and the lack of modern audio support continues to keep me from doing my full job there. It’s probably time they let us run macOS or, at the very least, virtualize it. Chance Miller: As usual, you can break the iPad category down into two parts: hardware and software. The new iPad Pro is the most visually impressive product Apple has released in years. I mean, who had Apple comparing the thinness of an iPad Pro to an iPod nano on their bingo card? Software-wise, the iPad continues to falter. iPadOS 18 added nothing new to the experience and Stage Manager feels like abandonware at this point. It’s a real bummer because I’d love to use the iPad Pro more often, especially with the new Magic Keyboard, which rights a lot of what was wrong with the last model. Nick Heer: I still find the iPad-and-accessories lineup confusing, but it is in much better shape this year than last. Apple introducing the M4 chip in an iPad first, and not a Mac, is one of those twists I still find hard to believe, but it happened! I promise! Michael Tsai: This seemed to be the year where a lot of people accepted that the software is what it is. If you love iPadOS, the hardware for running it is now better than ever. If not, no matter how much potential there may be, it’s time to stop waiting for Pro to happen in the way that you want and just use a Mac. David Sparks: My same answer as every year: Solid hardware with too conservative operating system and software. Rosemary Orchard: Nothing whelmed nor underwhelmed me. Marco Arment: Apple finally updated the iPad lineup, and it has all of the strengths and weaknesses it has always had: great hardware with amazing computational power that’s almost impossible to utilize because of software limitations. Shahid Kamal Ahmad: I have the latest iPad Pro Max. I’d have given it a higher mark had the OS been able to use the power of the device better, but as has been heard by many notable commentators, it’s just not there yet; the hardware power continues to massively outpace any progress in delivering that power to the user in a way that suits the iPad without compromising its accessibility. While this is going to be a tough nut for Apple to crack, if they want to sell more devices, they’re going to have to make the iPad more useful. Michael Gartenberg: The iPad is the iPad. At the lower ends, they’re still the best for content consumption, at the high end, the Pro OLED models do deliver the best way to watch Severance on a mobile device. It’s a hard sell for creators to spend the money on a tricked-out iPad with Magic Keyboard when a cheaper MacBook will do the job better for most people. Aleen Simms: The iPad’s hardware is unparalleled, but iPadOS still feels like a failed experiment. The iPads Pro are such stellar pieces of hardware, but the inflexibility of the operating system hamstrings them. I know that many people use iPads to great effect, but most people are unwilling or unable to put in the effort it takes to create workarounds—or they don’t even know that workarounds are possible. Lex Friedman: The iPad product line is confusing. I bought an Air to replace an old Pro. I should have bought a Pro ONLY because Face ID on the iPad is so much better. But iPad Pros are ridiculously expensive. The iPad is great! But the product lines are too much. James Thomson: I genuinely couldn’t remember if there had been new iPads this year. Great hardware that continues to remain underutilized by the software. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues on iPad, too. Joe Rosensteel: I don’t find this platform compelling, and it’s mostly the fault of iPadOS. Shelly Brisbin: The new iPad Pro is great, as is the iPad Air, which adopts tech from the previous Pro. I’m thoroughly happy with my 13-inch Air. I’m not the first to point out iPadOS’ continuing limitations. The better the hardware becomes, the more glaring the software problems become. And it seems there’s little appetite or corporate support for making big changes to the platform. Zac Hall: An even thinner design and optional nanotexture define this generation for me. Quinn Nelson: iPadOS continues to be a “love it or hate it” experience, but the M4 iPad Pro, with its stunning OLED display, feels like a sci-fi-level feat of engineering. Steven Aquino: I was gifted a 13″ M4 iPad Pro (with Magic Keyboard) for my birthday in September. The hardware, most especially the OLED display, is stunning. As to software, although iPadOS does exactly what I need it to do, there’s no question the pace of improvement needs to pick up. John Gruber: The iPad hardware story is excellent. iPad Pros got the M4 chips months ahead of the Mac and now have an excellent nano-texture display option. (Please, Apple: bring nano-texture to the iPhone. Take my money.) The iPad Air got a fine update to the M2 chip in May. And the iPad Mini got its first update since 2021, and thus continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. But iPadOS still strikes me like the no-man’s-land platform: nowhere near as capable productivity-wise as a Mac; nowhere near as portable or as conceptually simple as an iPhone. I made a concerted effort not to use my iPad for anything but long-form reading in recent months. I find myself noticeably more productive for it. To me, it’s like trying to work with my hands while wearing mittens. Eric Slivka: The iPad Pro, with its incredibly thin form factor, OLED, cutting-edge M4 chip, and landscape front camera, received a great update. The iPad Air also received a solid upgrade, and the long-in-the-tooth iPad mini received its Apple Intelligence upgrade. However, I would still love to see Apple do more on the software side to take advantage of the iPad’s power and screen size. Andy Ihnatko: There has been little progress with the OS or hardware. But we finally got a new iPad Mini, and my heart is full! Rich Mogull: The M4 iPad Pro is a marvel. The new iPad Mini is… well… maybe next time. I’d rate it a solid 4.5, so I rounded up. Stephen Hackett: There’s little to say about the iPad this year that hasn’t been said. The M4 iPad Pro pushes the ole “Wow, this iPad hardware can do so much more than iPadOS will let it” adage to the stratosphere. It’s powerful and thin, with an amazing screen, but it’s still just an iPad. The new Magic Keyboard looks fantastic, but it’s still hooked up to iPad apps. I’ve settled into equilibrium with this in my usage. My iPad mini is a great tablet for what I use it for: YouTube, TV shows, podcasts, and reading. I may hop into Slack or scroll through my mentions on social media, but I’m just no longer interested in turning the iPad into a computer I can or want to use for work. Zooming out, the overall iPad family is still messy in places. Thankfully, the 9th-gen iPad has been sent out to pasture, meaning all iPads finally use the modern gesture system for control. All iPads basically look the same, but there are still numerous differences as you move up and down the product line. The fact that Apple’s iPad keyboard page has a huge dropdown for a user to pick which iPad they have so the website can show them compatible models is not great, but Apple has been making progress. The current line of Apple Pencils is pretty straightforward, and having two models of iPad Air makes a lot of sense. I hope that the company keeps working to restore sense to the iPad hardware line while, at the same time, making iPadOS more capable for those who want to use their iPads more than they can today. Christina Warren: I hope we get a good iPad update in 2025 because I need to buy one for my mom, and I’m annoyed the iPad Air doesn’t ship with 256GB standard, raising the price the $700. The 2024 updates to the iPad Pro were tempting but I kept my 2022 11” iPad Pro because I don’t want to buy a new keyboard or Apple Pencil. And my M2 is still so powerful, given the software is utterly anemic. The problem with the iPad, or at least the iPad Pro, continues to be iPad OS. It just isn’t as robust as I would like for something that costs more than a MacBook Air. And the MacBook Air now has 16GB of RAM standard. And that’s before you have the price for the pencil and keyboard. If you’re going to tout the importance of the form factor, don’t nerf what I can do with it. It’s especially annoying when you can run many iPad apps on the Mac and use your iPad as a second display with touch support on the same Mac. So I continue to be mad that I can’t run VS Code or something like it on my iPad. And that my web browser on my $1000+ tablet cannot even run real web apps super well. The iPad Air is probably the ideal iPad for the middle-of-the-road user, though I think a 256GB 10th gen iPad is probably just fine too. I forgot Apple even updated the iPad mini this year. I think Apple did, too. Adam Engst: At least Apple released new iPads after a year off, but they don’t change the game at all. I’ve basically stopped using the iPad at this point, and none of the new models give me any reason to rethink that. Performance isn’t the problem. Myke Hurley: I am no longer going to grade the iPad on the disappointment of iPadOS. I have accepted the iPad for what it is rather than what I want it to be. The new M4 iPad Pro is everything I wanted. I use the 11-inch as my main device at home, and I love everything about it. The OLED screen is fantastic, and it is so thin and light—it’s a joy to use. John Siracusa: The M4 is a great iPad chip, but the highlight of the year for me was the Tandem OLED display on the new iPad Pro. I use my iPad as a tiny TV most of the time, and OLED displays provide the best picture quality available today. It’s been an amazing upgrade for me, even if it seems like I’m “wasting” that M4 by using it to watch videos for hours on end. Oh yeah, and they updated the camera placement, improved the Apple Pencil, and made all the Pro iPads even thinner. It seems like the rest of the world is not as excited as I am about the new iPad Pro. That may have something to do with the (continuing) limited and confusing nature of iPadOS. But for me, the new M4 iPad Pro is the best iPad ever. Paul Kafasis: The hardware updates were good, but I hoped to see more from the new Mini. I’d been waiting to upgrade to a new Mini, but the minor update meant I bailed on that idea. Casey Liss: While I don’t regret buying a new iPad Pro in 2022… I kind of regret it. The 2024 iPad Pros are really stunning—a phenomenal OLED screen in a case that cannot possibly be that thin. They’re such a joy to hold, and I want one despite having absolutely zero need for one. The Mini was my iPad of choice for many years, but I’ve squeezed it out by the combination of my phone getting ever-larger and the incredible utility the Magic Keyboard brings to my iPad Pro. Jessica Dennis: I pretty much only buy the iPad Mini, and Apple put out a new one in 2024, so I bought it. I like that it’s purple. I was upgrading from a 5th-generation iPad Mini, and other than being snappier (and having TouchID on the power button instead of a button below the screen), I don’t feel like I gained a whole lot. I am not surprised that Regular People suffer from Apple Pencil Confusion — even I had to go back and check which one(s) would work with my new iPad when I was deciding that I didn’t really need one anyway. Alex Cox: The tale as old as time is that iPadOS can’t keep up with the hardware in the iPad. This year, the design of the hardware doesn’t match the internals. Yes, the new form factor and screen options are great, but even the new Magic Keyboard for iPad feels like a mediocre upgrade after four years. The promise of the iPad’s modularity still doesn’t pay off. Eric Linder: I have purchased almost every iPad model since its debut, and I will likely continue to do so. I absolutely love it, and use it every day. But it is such a shame that the hardware improvements are so far out of alignment with its software. One thing I love about Apple is that so often, they underpromise and over-deliver. But with iPad OS, the opposite is the case. They hyped up Stage Manager so much, and I recall the excitement that fellow Apple geeks like Federico Viticci shared with the community. It shipped broken, which is somewhat forgivable, but what is not forgivable is that two years later, it seems like Apple has completely forgotten about it. This does not bode well for the future of iPadOS. Whereas iOS continues to build and iterate on most of its features, it seems like iPadOS is just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and sadly, not much is sticking. Allison Sheridan: It was a solid year for iPad. The M4 coming to the iPad Pro before the Macs was interesting, while moving the camera to the landscape side was probably a bigger improvement to the user experience. The iPad Air got a modest improvement going to M2 and remains a solid choice. Even the iPad mini finally got an update. Gui Rambo: The fact that after all these years the iPad is still using the exact same foundations as iOS, including its multitasking model, is just baffling. We have iPads with Apple’s most powerful CPU cores that can’t have Final Cut Pro export a video in the background due to these stupid limitations. How would you rate Apple’s performance in Wearables overall in 2024? Consider the Apple Watch, Vision Pro, AirPods, and anything else you deem appropriate. Charles Arthur: The Vision Pro has been a calamity. What it needed was content, and what it also needed was app support. Apple hasn’t done the first, and alienated developers so badly in other areas that it didn’t get the second – Netflix and YouTube being the obvious objectors. If you can’t charm the two biggest content platforms to be on your device, then you are already fighting with one, perhaps both, hands behind your back. The lack of immersive sports content is significant. The Vision Pro will never take off without it. Joe Rosensteel: The Apple Watch is pretty stagnant and has feature regressions thanks to the ongoing patent dispute. The Vision Pro really whiffed. I was filled with ennui when the guy conducting my Vision Pro demo noted how sharp and readable the text was and how it could be used for work… A sentiment I didn’t share at all, and really underscored that people at Apple didn’t really know how to make a $3500 science fiction gadget exciting. Casey Liss: The addition of medical-grade hearing aid functionality to the AirPods Pro is Apple at its best. The AirPods Pro remain possibly my favorite Apple product of all time. I use them on and off all day, every single day. However, the utterly preposterous AirPods Max “refresh” is borderline insulting for fans of that device. I am not a fan of it and yet here I am grumbling about it. (Apple Watch specific stuff follows)I would never have guessed, when working on my 2023 Report Card, that I’d be here working on my 2024 Report Card, still discussing the Masimo lawsuit. It is rather absurd that Apple, a company with effectively infinite resources, hasn’t fixed this problem. Throw money at it in terms of licensing, or just buy Masimo outright. Do something. The Ultra wasn’t bumped in any way this year, which was disappointing. Before the September event, I had assumed I was going to buy myself an Ultra 3 as my new watch. The lack of hardware updates — other than an admittedly hot black case — convinced me to go with a Series 10 instead. I like my Series 10, and I am pleased it’s thinner than my prior Series 8, but it’s otherwise more of the same. The one large difference for me is the addition of fast charging, which is a surprising quality of life improvement — especially if you sleep track. Sigh—what to make of the Vision Pro? I preordered one, and collected it on launch day. It is, without exception, the coolest piece of technology I own. It is unlike anything I had previously experienced, and as I’ve said many times, using a Vision Pro is strapping the future onto your face today. As I write this, today a fortnightly chat with your beloved editor (and three others) is scheduled. These hangouts — which are “just” FaceTime calls — are so uncanny. Those of us who can make any given call will sit, using our Spatial Personas, in the circle the Vision Pro software puts us in, and chitchat. Something about having that presence makes it feel like so much more than the handful of monthly FaceTime calls I have with friends — including one of the others on this fortnightly call. A FaceTime call with my friend James feels like a phone conversation with video. A Spatial FaceTime call with James, Jason, and others… that feels like hanging out. I could make a strong argument that if you and your friends can convince yourselves to spend the absurd amount of money for a Vision Pro, Spatial FaceTime calls are worth it alone. But the killer app for the Vision Pro — if you ever leave your house to do work — is definitely Mac Virtual Display. Just before the end of the year, Apple came out with a second version of MVD, and holy smokes, it’s incredible. My at-home setup is three 5K monitors because, well, I have problems. While my 13″ M3 Max MacBook Pro lets me take all the power of a desktop out of the house, it very much does not let me take all the screen real estate. Well, it didn’t, anyway. Now it does. In fact, the Ultrawide mode on MVD is too wide. A problem that I never thought I’d have. If we can only normalize wearing them, my portable computing life will improve vastly. I have used my Vision Pro at our local library, but I always do so in a study room, because I’m too embarrassed to do so in the throngs of everyone in the main areas. I’m writing this post at a local Wegmans, and I’m doing so without my AVP, because I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. The Vision Pro is incredible, and every time I strap that stupid thing to my face, I can’t believe how lucky I am to have one and how cool this device is. However, I only have the occasion to do so once a week at most. The Vision Pro is an engineering marvel — easy 5. The Vision Pro is frustrating to use by itself and you look like an idiot when you do so — 2. That makes this section a 4 to me — as an engineer, I can’t get past how impressive it is. The Vision Pro is simultaneously more than I ever expected and a near-total letdown. Doing work in it is nigh impossible outside of MVD. Typing is so painful that I avoid it at all costs. Using Siri is not a substitute for a workable keyboard in visionOS. There’s not enough immersive content, although the pace is quickening and the content is getting ever-better. Ultimately, though, it’s too cool for me to grade any lower. Shelly Brisbin: Wearables feels like a category poised to evolve in interesting ways, and I’m here for it. 2024 gave us a couple of glimpses: the technology behind the Vision Pro and the adaptation of a pair of earbuds (AirPods Pro) to the task of finding and mitigating some kinds of hearing loss. I’m with those who admire the Vision Pro but are skeptical of its future as a viable product. I wish Apple were more open to the idea of offering developer-focused technology previews that aren’t necessarily ready for primetime. Let the early adopter/pundit class buy them, too, but set expectations about what the Vision Pro is good at. I recently saw how a developer plans to incorporate the Vision Pro into a wheelchair-based navigation assistant. Now that’s innovation! Marco Arment: Apple Vision Pro was the most disappointing launch I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory, with huge mismatches between the delivered product and consumer priorities and almost no follow-through from Apple to get software or content on the platform. A year after launch, a new owner can still watch the entire catalog of immersive videos during their first evening of taking the Vision Pro home… and then watch some episodes of Severance and still go to bed early. Lex Friedman: Apple Watch remains good. There isn’t much in the way of new features that I’m excited about on the Watch, but it remains good. I wish it were better at tracking steps on a Treadmill Desk, though. Apple Vision Pro remains a product that I am not at all interested in. Rich Mogull: The Apple Watch Ultra is getting close to being a true sports watch, but once you hit that category, Garmin still wins out (despite the latest Fenix updates being lackluster). The rest of the line is solid, but there still feels like room for growth. Eric Slivka: A thinner design for the Series 10 was a welcome change, but otherwise, we didn’t get much in this regard. The black Ultra 2 looks great, but no hardware updates was a disappointment, and we missed out on a rumored SE update as well that sounded like it could have brought some fun colors. I continue to be astonished that Apple hasn’t settled the blood oxygen patent dispute in the U.S. one way or another. Nearly a year in, Vision Pro continues to be a half-baked prototype. AirPods 4 look like a really nice upgrade that has helped modernize and streamline the lineup, but I’m an AirPods Pro user looking forward to a 2025 update on those. AirPods Max simply adopting USB-C and some new colors with no other changes is so sad that it’s hilarious. Stephen Hackett: Apple continues to kill it when it comes to AirPods. The AirPods 4 (especially with ANC) offers incredible value, while the AirPods Pro 2 continue to become more valuable to users through some remarkable software updates. Using AirPods as a way to take a hearing test or have your hearing augmented means millions of people who didn’t even know they had hearing loss will enjoy more moments with their loved ones in conversation. With the Apple Watch, it’s more of the same good vibes. Detecting falls, car crashes, and possible cardiac issues has saved an untold number of people, and with sleep apnea detection in the newest batch of Apple Watches, users can be notified if their Watches detect a problem. This is some of Apple’s most important work. I took the lack of an Apple Watch Ultra 3 personally, but the Series 10’s thinner and more powerful design almost makes up for it, as long as my bought-it-on-launch-day-like-a-maniac Apple Watch Ultra 1 holds on. 2024 saw the launch of the Vision Pro, and it’s unlike any Apple product launch I can remember. The Vision Pro is an incredible feat of engineering. Just holding the thing feels nice, and the years of work that went into it shows when the screens light up. It is the only AR or VR headset I have worn that hasn’t made me feel sick after a few minutes. The Vision Pro is priced like a computer because Mac-level hardware powers its array of cameras and sensors, screens, audio system, and more. visionOS springs to life on this hardware — after a lengthy boot process — and wraps the user in a world of their own content and apps. The floating windows feel real and stay in place as if they are made of actual frosted glass. The pass-through video feed of the outside world is by no means perfect, but it’s fast to respond to a turn of your head. A simple turn of the Digital Crown has the world fade away, dissolving into any number of landscapes that can help you focus on the task at hand. Sadly, there are just a handful of tasks best suited for spatial computing. Text input can be tedious without a keyboard, the lack of any window management tools mean there’s a lot of fussing about needed if you want to look at more than one application at once. (Stage Manager seems like it was built for this thing.) The App Store is quiet on the Vision Pro. The high price of the device has surely limited its adoption from both the user and developer perspectives. The new nature of the platform means users need to experience the Vision Pro before understanding it. Apple Stores have done a good job at this, but most consumers don’t know what they’d do with a device like this beyond playing games, which isn’t Apple’s strength. There’s no killer app for visionOS yet, and even if there was, you end up back at the price tag. Nick Heer: On the plus side, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and Vision Pro. On the other hand, Apple Watch Ultra New Color, AirPods Max New Colors, and Vision Pro. Christina Warren: AirPod Pro 2 remains one of the best products Apple has ever released. The OTC hearing aid function is such a huge win for so many people. I don’t understand why the AirPods 4 with noise canceling exist, but that’s not my business. Just buy the AirPod Pro 2s on sale. I regret to inform the world that I bought the USB-C AirPods Max. No one else should do the same. An overpriced product that lost features over four years, got zero improvements, and is now priced even worse compared to the competition. As for Apple Watch, I upgraded this year (and to the Hermes edition at that — the Grand H band got me) after sitting out the Series 9 year and I noticed nothing different — though the screen is larger than my Series 8 and the new Hermes band is amazing. But the lack of the blood ox stuff doesn’t impact me, but it’s a regression I dislike. I hope Apple can return this feature in the future. I did not buy an Apple Vision Pro this year and I do not regret my decision. It was a rare example of restraint on my part. I think it is a terrific tech demo and incredibly well-engineered. This sort of technology at theme park rides or in certain scenarios is jaw-dropping. But I could never convince myself I’d use it enough to not feel bad when it inevitably sat unused on my shelf. I can afford to buy one. But I am sadly not rich enough to be able to buy one and not feel angry about its lack of use. The weight and face pressure are also concerns — I’m glad to see the Belkin strap seems to have improved the fit. The lack of apps, let alone a killer app, outside of watching movies alone, is an indictment of Apple’s developer relations problems as much as it is an indictment of the AVP itself. I can’t help but think Apple’s focus on AR/VR at the expense of things like AI was a mistake, and I’m not convinced we’ll ever see the promise of Apple Vision Pro. Again, incredible tech demo. But I can’t convince myself to buy one and I love to use girl math to make bad decisions. It is what it is. Myke Hurley: I feel like this was a miss year for the Apple Watch from a hardware perspective – thinner is great, but I want to see more design change! However, watchOS 11 is a really great advancement. I love the enhancements to widgets and the Smart Stack, as well as the inclusion of live activities. The new Photos face is amazing. I love the fact that I get these moments of joy every time I look down at my watch, as it picks a photo to show me from a vacation or a cute photo of my wife. I cannot wait to see photos of my baby on this. The Vision Pro is a real mixed bag. The launch was so exciting, the hardware is so futuristic, and visionOS is overall a good operating system with some good advancements through the year. But the lack of developer support, and the loss of buzz for the product over the year cannot be ignored. I really hope for more, as I believe in the platform. But I could not give it the mark I had hoped for. Benjamin Mayo: Before this year, I had always assumed noise cancellation would be the AirPod Pro’s differentiating feature. I have a dislike for the feel of the in-ear tips, so I had just accepted I would always be missing out on that. But 2024 brought the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and it’s amazing. The noise cancellation is incredibly effective given the open-earbud design. Even the non-ANC base model is way better value for money than what Apple previously sold at that price point. Peter Cohen: The Vision Pro will be a fantastic product when it’s ready to come out of beta in a couple of years. Federico Viticci: I love my new AirPods 4, and I find the combination of no in-ear tips and basic noise cancellation a fantastic balance of trade-offs and comfort. I didn’t rely on AirPods Pro’s advanced noise cancellation and other audio features that much, so switching to the “simpler” AirPods 4 when they were released was a no-brainer for me. As flawed as the Vision Pro can be (it is, after all, a fancy developer kit with an almost non-existent third-party app ecosystem), I also think it’s an impressive showcase of what Apple can do with hardware and miniaturization if money is not a concern and engineers are free to build whatever they want. I don’t use the Vision Pro on a regular basis, but whenever I do, I’m reminded that visionOS is an exciting long-term prospect for what I hope will eventually be shrunk down to glasses. That, in fact, is the reason why I’m not giving this category 5 stars. I really want to stop using my Meta Ray-Ban glasses, but Apple doesn’t have an alternative that I can purchase today – and worse, it sounds like their version may not be ready for quite some time still. It seems like Apple is, at this point, almost institutionally incapable of releasing a minimum viable product that doesn’t have to be a complete platform with an entire app ecosystem and a major marketing blitz. I just want Apple to make a pair of glasses that combine AirPods, Siri, and a basic camera. I don’t need Apple to make XR glasses that project a computer in front of my eyes today. And I wish the company would understand this – that they would see the interest in “simple” glasses that have speakers, a microphone, and a camera, and release that product this year. I hope they change their minds and can fast-track such a product rather than wait for visionOS to support that kind of form factor years from now. Brent Simmons: Got new AirPods in 2024 — they won’t stay in my ear. I tried Vision Pro and am not surprised it didn’t sell well, especially at that price. Kirk McElhearn: The Vision Pro developer kit looks like it is full of innovations, but just doesn’t seem like something I’d want to use. Who wants to wear a computer strapped to their face for a long time? And the price is out of reach for most users. As a proof of concept, it’s interesting, but the mere concept of that device, and the way Apple has promoted it, feels like an episode of Black Mirror. Michael Gartenberg: Watch seems to have stagnated with some odd choices. Watch 10 has a screen that can do things Watch Ultra can’t, even though Ultra remains the best choice for battery life (and replacing the Rolex Submariner as the watch for desk athletes). The new back titanium is pretty, along with the new titanium bands. AirPods also got a weird upgrade with the new models lacking the hearing aid features that live in the pro models. As someone who listened to his iPod too loud at the turn of the century, I found the hearing features to work pretty well, but they aren’t replacements for OTC hearing aids. The battery life is way too short, and it’s kind of socially awkward to talk to someone when you have earbuds in, needing to explain that you really are listening to them and not tuning them out. I do think there’s a great opportunity for Apple to build a true hearing-first, music-second device for users. It’s clear they have the technology, and this is an area where Apple can really shine with a product to fill a need and make all the other products in that category obsolete. The less said about Vision Pro, the better for Apple. It’s been a long time since Apple took a swing for the fences and struck out. AVP remains a device that should have been called a developer kit or “peek at the future” science experiment, not as an end-user product. It’s an odd case where Apple tried to leapfrog the market and be first but also flawed. AVP doesn’t compete with anything on the market. It’s a device all alone in that space at that price. Apparently it’s great for watching Ted Lasso on your ceiling, according to Tim, but not really useful for much else. Ironically, the sleeper wearable/AI came from Meta, with their collaboration with Ray-Ban. Meta chose a subset of features such as photos/music/messaging/AI that relies on your phone to do the heavy lifting, works reliably well and comes in a form factor that’s actually fashion friendly. It’s the type of device with feature set and partnership that Apple could have and should have done. All the features would tie wonderfully into Apple’s ecosystem. Meta didn’t even haggle over branding—the Ray-Bans just say Ray-Ban. It’s not too late for Apple to do something similar, but I doubt that they would do a product copy if for no other reason than out of pride. Quinn Nelson: The Vision Pro is expensive and uncomfortable. It’s too heavy, the straps are awful, the software feels primitive and limited, and it lacks the robust first- and third-party app support it desperately needs. Even Mac Virtual Display isn’t polished enough to replace a dedicated desktop monitor. In short, it feels unfinished. But despite all that, it has improved significantly since launch—and I still find myself looking for excuses to use it because every time I put it on, I can’t help but think, “holy crap, this is incredible.” Andy Ihnatko: The Vision Pro isn’t an embarrassment for Apple; it’s fine. It’s not the breakthrough, paradigm-destroying hit product for 2024 that Apple imagined when they started developing the Vision Pro in earnest in 2016. Unfortunately, the TVA pruned that timeline during the most boring episode of “Loki” ever. Here in Earth-616, the Vision Pro is just a high-end version of one of those VR headsets that nobody really needs. Jessica Dennis: The newer, thinner Apple Watch is legitimately pretty great (and I’m grateful that I could still use all my existing bands). I was kinda bummed that there was no stainless steel model this year; I had psyched myself up to finally upgrade from aluminum, but I didn’t particularly care for the titanium models, so went with the jet black aluminum after all. I do really love all the ultramarine accessories, though — my phone and phone case are also ultramarine. Brian Mattucci: I love the new Apple Watch, and have no complaints. I was all set to upgrade to USB-C AirPods Max, but they didn’t change anything else about them so I had to pass. As for Vision Pro, I held off on even trying it for many months, largely due to all of the negative things I heard about it. But then I did the store demo and ended up buying one. I’ve used it nearly every single day since, and I’m very happy with it. I don’t fault Apple for creating an expensive device for early adopters (like me), but I do fault them for not doing enough to allow for a thriving App Store. Rumors of PSVR2 controller support are welcome, but late. I know Vision Pro isn’t primarily for games and that’s not why anyone would buy one at this point, but it adds value to the device and helps people justify the purchase (especially of an eventual more reasonably priced version). While AVP is a weighty device, I don’t find it uncomfortable with the solo loop alone. Everyone’s skull is different, and there are many options out there, but I think it requires a lot of a person to understand how to wear AVP comfortably and people simply aren’t used to it. Other complaints I’ve found don’t really apply to me (FOV) or aren’t that big of a deal to me (glare). Ultimately I think AVP is their best first-gen device ever and I’m excited to see how the next several revisions improve on things. I hope it doesn’t take them years to add folder support though – my home screen is a mess. Rosemary Orchard: I need an Apple Watch Ultra that fits on my wrist. Allison Sheridan: The clear winner on wearables this year were the AirPods. Redesigning them to fit more ear shapes caught my eye originally. but noise cancellation in the non-Pros has made them a big draw. The OTC hearing aid features of the Pros is also compelling. Apple Watch was a very modest improvement. Dr. Drang: AirPods are such a good product that Apple is now adding features I have to turn off. Head gestures seemed like a good idea until I looked both ways before crossing the street when a question was pending. John Gruber: AirPods 4 with ANC are a terrific update, and AirPods Pro 2, though years-old hardware, saw significant software improvements—most notably, widely acclaimed support for use as certified hearing aids. AirPods continue to exemplify Apple its best. Series 10 watches feature a new display that supports once-per-second updates while in energy-saving always-on mode. So the seconds hand on an analog face can “tick” once per second even when the display isn’t fully on. But Apple only enabled this ticking seconds indicator on two watch faces, both new to WatchOS 11: Flux and Reflections. Setting aside the fact that I personally don’t like either of those faces (Flux in particular seems deliberately obtuse), this is ridiculous. WatchOS 11 offers, by my quick count, at least 33 different watch faces that offer a non-digital seconds hand or indicator. And only two of them support the new 1Hz refresh rate? That’s bullshit. And it wasn’t just a launch thing, because here we are in January and no additional watch faces have been updated to support it. This is not how a serious watchmaker treats its watches. I will admit to caring far more about always-on second hands than most people, but what a waste of a technical breakthrough. Not just most, but every single watch face should have been updated to support ticking seconds. Apple Watch is turning more into a fitness tracker that happens to show the time, and away from serving as a proper watch. Also: no Ultra 3 this year. The year-old Ultra 2 did gain a very nice black titanium color option, but that’s it. Kind of weird for a watch that starts at $800 to skip a year of silicon improvements. Is Vision Pro a hit? No, far from it. But I remain unconvinced that Apple ever had much hope that this first Vision device would sell in much higher quantities than it has. The narrative that it’s a laughably overpriced bust reminds me of the original Macintosh in 1984, whose $2,500 price tag, adjusted for inflation, works out to over $7,500 in today’s dollars. After an initial wave of publicity on launch, the original Macintosh sold so poorly that it was arguably the impetus for John Sculley and Apple’s board to fire Steve Jobs and exile him from the company. Many pundits of the era confidently proclaimed that the entire concept of a GUI was a gimmick with no future. Am I predicting that the Vision platform will have as bright and essential a future ahead of it as the Macintosh did in 1984? No. But I suspect it has a bright and essential future ahead of it. The entire concept and paradigm is so new and different that, like the Macintosh 40 years prior, the product had to ship years before a version could be made at a price that appeals to the mass market, and years before there’s all that much to do using it. But, as it stands, Vision Pro today offers an incredible experience for watching traditional movies and shows, and a breakthrough experience for watching spatial content. If Bang & Olufsen sold this product in a form that only played movies — no “spatial computing” — it would cost $10,000 and some people would consider it well worth the price. Spatial computing feels fun to me, but not very productive. That could change, and I suspect “fun but not productive” is how I would have described trying to work on a Macintosh in 1984 vs. an Apple II. And Vision Pro’s remarkable (and with VisionOS 2, much improved) Mac Virtual Display feature is a highly-productive environment for work. I can’t give Vision Pro an A for 2024, but I foresee A’s in future years. John Siracusa: At best, the Vision Pro seems like a first step on a long journey. It will require many years of dedication, and perhaps some significant pivots, to turn this platform into a success. After spending a decade and several billion dollars on a car project that never shipped, I hope Apple can muster the resolve to keep plugging away at the Vision Pro. The new AirPods 4 are great for those of us who don’t want our headphones to be shoved into our ear canals. The noise canceling cannot compete with literal earplugs that are the AirPods Pro, but it’s still a nice improvement. The smaller size of both the earbuds and the case are also great. After a brief burst of excitement from the Apple Watch Ultra a few years ago, we appear to be in a holding pattern again as we wait for a more radical redesign of the mainstream Apple watch. The new watches this year were fine, though. Steven Aquino: Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro all are winners in general. The new Apple Watch’s bigger screen in a lightweight package is lovely, especially after wearing an Ultra for 2 years solely for its big screen. Vision Pro is the most accessible content consumption device I’ve ever used, but it is heavy, and the app story for streaming TV and movies feels thin other than TV+ and Disney+. Matt Birchler: The Apple Watch seems to be coasting along, which isn’t terrible, but it seems like that product is approaching its effective final form, while AirPods continue to get really good software updates that make them more valuable over time (except for AirPods Max, of course). The Vision Pro really drops this category down, as it does have some devotees, but they seem to be a huge minority of purchasers. There was chatter after the Vision Pro’s unveiling at WWDC 2023 that it sucked the energy out of the LLM “fad” that was just getting off the ground, but at the end of 2024 I think it’s clear that the Vision Pro is far more niche and unexciting than we thought it would be nearly one year into its time on the market. Aleen Simms: I’m glad they released the Vision Pro, but it still feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist (for most people). I’m interested to see where Apple decides to take it over the next several iterations, assuming they continue product development. A convenient, glasses-like wearable could be a major accessibility boon for a lot of people. Michael Tsai: The AirPods 4 seem good. AirPods Max remains a product in Apple’s lineup. Apple no longer offers software updates for my watch, and I’m waiting for a new Apple Watch SE, which hasn’t been announced yet. Apple Vision Pro is technically impressive, but it increasingly seems like Apple built the wrong thing. Those engineering resources would have been much better spent improving Apple’s other platforms. Chance Miller: The AirPods Pro 2, despite being over two years old, are the standout wearable product of the year. The new hearing health features will go down as one of Apple’s most important releases of all time. Apple Vision Pro gets a lot more hate than it deserves. I’ve had very few if any, technological experiences as magical as interacting with it. Apple has work to do if it wants Apple Vision Pro (or whatever “Vision” product comes next) to truly become the future of computing. The good news is that I think Apple is taking the feedback in stride and will continue to perfect the spatial computing experience in years to come. The Apple Watch Series 11 is the first Apple Watch that feels like it sits flat on my wrist. It’s a subtle change, but one I notice every day. Andrew Laurence: Barely one year into the Vision Pro’s product life, I it feels like the early days of the Apple Watch — also introduced with a set of features that showed a puzzling lack of vision. Over time, the Watch found its market of utility, and apps sprung up around it. We’ll see if the same happens with Vision Pro. Meanwhile… is Vision Pro, like Apple Intelligence, a case of organizational FOMO leaking out to product? I, for one, have zero interest in “strap something to my face” computing. Might Apple Watch’s greatest impact be a generational change in product naming? Since the Watch, Apple’s wholly new products and services have followed its naming convention of “Apple Product”, with “Product” being a generic category word. Since then, Cisco retired “AnyConnect” for “Cisco Secure Client”; Dell retired years of brand equity for the same convention of “Dell Product.” Is “Ford Truck” next? AirPods Pro 2 continues to be my most consistently superlative purchase in some years. Carolina Milanesi: Apple Watch has become a cornerstone of the ecosystem for many users and a device that is keeping users in the ecosystem, as competition on the phone side is growing in Android both on form factor and AI. Paul Kafasis: AirPods updates have been great. Apple Watch, well, they really need to fix their patent situation. Vision Pro… God, so much hype, and it sure seems like a pretty big flop. From all I can see, even those people who were excited about it are finding themselves not using it. Alex Cox: Apple Vision Pro is the most influential hardware I’ve ever used, and I don’t have anyone to else to use it with, make things with it, or even demo it unless they’re willing to sit for forty minutes to make sure the guest mode calibration works. Apple is getting in the way of letting AVP grow, and not just because of the price. Until there’s developer access to more APIs and more accessibility to dev kits, I don’t think there will be anything interesting made for AVP that isn’t a big-budget immersive video partially funded by Apple. David Sparks: The Vision Pro deserves better than its current reputation as a pundit punching bag. While everyone’s busy dunking on Apple’s spatial computing experiment, I’m regularly strapping it on and using it for work and entertainment. It’s definitely first-generation, but there’s something genuinely compelling here. I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes. Adam Engst: The big story in 2024 for wearables is the AirPods Pro 2 and their hearing health and hearing aid capabilities. Those have the potential to be life-changing for many people. Otherwise, it’s hard to get excited about the changes to the Apple Watch Series 10. The Vision Pro is impressive technology that completely misses the mark in terms of being useful and affordable. Dan Moren: The AirPods Pro 2’s Hearing Aid feature is probably the biggest announcement in all of Apple’s wearables lines this year. It’s truly impressive, even if it’s not something that everybody’s going to use. But this is where Apple’s Health initiatives shine: solving actual problems people have and doing so in a way that’s accessible to the masses. I find the Vision Pro fascinating, but have spent so little time with one that I can’t offer more than that. I hope the next one’s cheaper. Dave Hamilton: The hearing features added to AirPods Pro 2 are a HUGE game-changer in my world. The active earplugs feature works so well that these have replaced my custom-fit musicians’ earplugs as my default earplugs for concerts. As for Vision Pro, I’m eager to see where Apple takes it, but it’s obviously just a public beta at this point of some very cool, extremely overpriced tech. James Thomson: The Vision Pro is a fantastically impressive technological achievement that no normal person should actually buy. The hearing aid functionality for the AirPods Pro could genuinely change lives. Craig Hockenberry: I have largely ignored the Vision Pro, and it appears I am not alone. I still don’t see a reason to put the thing on my head for hours each day. Michael E. Cohen: I have a Vision Pro and really like it, but mostly as the best widescreen and 3D video-watching experience I’ve ever experienced. The device needs more apps, especially the kind of apps only Apple can provide that demonstrate to other developers both the device’s unique (and sometimes less obvious) capabilities and the best ways to make those capabilities accessible to users. How would you rate Apple’s overall performance in Home technology in 2024? Consider HomeKit, the Home app, Matter, overall strategy and anything else you deem appropriate. Rosemary Orchard: I love the support of Matter. But feel more progress needs to be made. Lex Friedman: The Home app is ugly. Home app integrations in Control Center are useful but inflexible. Dave Hamilton: Attending CES the past two years, I saw a marked shift in how much Matter mattered to vendors. (I had to do it.) Last year, everyone was stoked to tell me they had added Matter support to their various widgets. This year, it was mentioned as an afterthought, “Oh, and yes, we’ll support Matter if and when that becomes important to our customers.” Myke Hurley: The new Control Center actions I can add have saved Apple’s Home efforts for me this year. Outside of that, I am not sure of anything else I could focus on. I hope for a 5/5 next year, though. Michael Gartenberg: The digital home is a mess, and Apple is doing its best to tame it in an Apple way. No one is doing a better job but no one is doing a great job either for consumers to implement. Steven Aquino: As an Apple user, I love the idea of HomeKit. The smart home makes tasks like turning lights on and off more accessible. What frustrates me, however, is its unreliability. I see “No Response” statuses way more often than I’d like, and it sullies the overall experience. Christina Warren: I don’t understand why Apple continues to pretend to invest in this area. Pro tip: use Home Assistant, the excellent open-source project that will let all your IoT stuff talk to one another using whatever you want — rather than trying to get HomeKit to do what it claims it is going to do. John Gruber: I can’t name one improvement to HomeKit or anything Home-related in 2024, and this is a platform sorely in need of many improvements. Fingers crossed for 2025, though. I know there are talented people on that team, and they have to be up to something. Adam Engst: Did anything happen in 2024? Eric Slivka: 2025 sounds like it might be the year of the home for Apple, so 2024 didn’t see very much. The HomePod family managed only to replace the Space Gray mini with a Midnight one. HomeKit remains finicky at times, and I’m not sure Matter has helped much. David Sparks: This year, Apple made many nice quality-of-life improvements, including better Matter support, control center widgets, and (in my experience) more platform stability. There’s room for improvement, and I am interested in Apple possibly making its own accessories. But overall, I think Apple moved the needle in a positive direction. Casey Liss: The following is what I wrote for the 2024 report card. Word for word. Every word of it remains true, except now I’m using Home Assistant instead of Homebridge. I bumped my rating from 2 → 1 because, holy smokes, can we get some forward progress here, please? Same as it ever was. HomeKit is unreliable and doesn’t work with enough devices. It pains me that I have to run Homebridge. That’s not necessarily Apple’s fault, but it’s also not not Apple’s fault. Matter seems to be a total nothingburger. Same story: not their fault, but not not their fault. Though I’ve never owned a HomePod, I’ve heard continual grumbling of them failing. No thanks. Michael Tsai: My HomePod continues to not work well for Siri or music. This year, I dipped my toes into the Matter ecosystem. I was pleased to find that it all “just worked,” though the automation options are a bit limited, and I still don’t like the Home app. Paul Kafasis: Someday, the Home app and smart home controls will be better. They are still not this year, though! I have assorted Shortcuts to do things, and they seem to have gotten slower. Rich Mogull: As a 20-year home automation enthusiast with over 100 connected devices and a lot of automation code, I have historically rated this lower, but the combo of the Home app and Siri just gets the job done these days. I have no issues connecting what I need to and making it do what I want. A better Siri could easily bump this to a 5. Shelly Brisbin: Make the Home app better. It’s still awful. Matt Birchler: I scored this right down the middle because I don’t recall Apple doing much this year in the home category. However, I do have all of my smart home items in the Home app, and it works pretty well for me. In a post-Matter world, I have my choice of apps to use for this since my devices show up everywhere, but I still gravitate towards Apple’s app. Craig Hockenberry: If you had told me ten years ago that I’d have a phone app that controlled my 104-year-old home, I’d have laughed. Yet here we are: thanks to HomeKit, lights, heating, entertainment, and even a coffee pot are all seamlessly connected. Peter Cohen: Does Apple have a Home strategy? Does it really Matter? John Siracusa: Siri continues to be a boat anchor weighing down the HomePod and other HomeKit accessories. Apple Intelligence hasn’t even come to most home devices and probably won’t until they get hardware upgrades. Marco Arment: HomeKit continues to mostly work, but the promised world of Matter has still not materialized. The HomePod remains a buggy mess, and there are few signs of effort on either front. Benjamin Mayo: Apple kinda skipped this year as far as the smart home is concerned, so it’s hard to really pass judgment positively or negatively. I was disappointed by the lack of any Apple Intelligence strategy for the HomePod, though. Chance Miller: With the continued rollout of Matter, I expected a bigger upgrade to the Home app and HomeKit ecosystem in 2024. That didn’t happen. Apple has already lost so much of this market to other companies, but I’m hoping to see a renewed focus in 2025 with new hardware products and much-needed improvements to the Home app. Stephen Hackett: HomeKit continues to hum along, working better and better each year. The ecosystem continues to expand; if Matter ever really arrives, which ecosystem a particular product supports will become a moot question. Rumors are swirling about Apple entering new markets, with cameras, locks, and even smart screens a possibility for 2025 or later. We will have to judge those offerings if/when they arrive, but I’m fascinated to see what Apple would bring to the table. Federico Viticci: My entire apartment is wired to HomeKit, but I don’t love HomeKit because I’m tired of purchasing third-party hardware that doesn’t have the same degree of quality control that Apple typically brings to the table. I’m intrigued by the idea of Apple finally waking up and making a HomePod with a screen that could potentially serve as a flexible, interactive home hub. That’s a first step, and I hope it won’t disappoint. Seriously, though: I just would love for Apple to make routers again. Andrew Laurence: This technology enthusiast has yet to embrace Home or any of the “smart” home generations. All I hear about it is janky futzing and interoperability issues. These sound like problems, not solutions. Call me when it achieves the “Spouse acceptance factor” that TiVo had in 2000. Quinn Nelson: Another year, another bare-minimum effort from Apple to make any meaningful strides in the smart home space—beyond some obligatory Matter point updates. Apple Intelligence should play a key role in the home ecosystem, but the necessary software and hardware just aren’t there yet. Honestly, it feels like we’re still a few years away from Apple finally recommitting to the platform that needs it the most. Rob Griffiths: The Home app is a dreadful piece of software. Although I’m fairly technical, I still find it confusing, and the layout and home screen design are abysmal. Joe Rosensteel: I have experienced many bugs with Home. Even after I switched to the new home architecture, the tvOS 18.0 beta broke, and Apple TVs could not be used as a home hub for a few months. I replaced a bunch of WeMo smart plugs with Eve Energy smart plugs for no good reason other than WeMo just got flakey. There is no forward progress on the Home app, which remains a clunky pain in the butt. I still can’t add or remove seasonal devices (like smart plugs for my Christmas decorations) without it freaking out. I have Siri tell me it can’t turn on a scene from my Watch, but it can from my iPhone. It’s just a pervasive irritation that works often enough that I don’t rip it all out. Jeff Carlson: Still a mess, even though some of that is outside of Apple’s control. But come on, it’s been like this for years. Maybe 2025 will be the Year of Matter or whatever. I’ll save this comment for next year’s survey. James Thomson: How long have I been giving Apple the benefit of the doubt that this will be the year they turn around their Home strategy? Zac Hall: Home is a category that remains in the Six Colors Report Card lineup. Allison Sheridan: I continue to be disappointed in the Home app itself. The interface isn’t getting less baffling than it ever was, even for a seasoned user. Scenes vs. Automations continue to break my brain. “One of your devices didn’t respond” is a message that could use a slight improvement; WHICH ONE??? The only good news I see on this front is that at CES, Matter was all the rage, causing vendors to proudly display compatibility with HomeKit. Charles Arthur: Never improves. The commands haven’t changed: being able to put an IF statement in would make such a difference. (Yes, you can do it with Shortcuts if you have the patience, but who does? Why should you have to divert out of the Home app, which has Actions, to Shortcuts?) Dr. Drang: I like my new HomePods mini, but Siri still hampers their value. Carolina Milanesi: Does Apple even care anymore? Glenn Fleishman: I’m giving Home a low rating because, despite improvements to the Home app across platforms, including the important issue of granting guests access, it’s still a bloody mess of an interface. I’ve added several smart things to my network in recent months: a lock, outlet switches to control lights, a porch HomeKit bulb, more cameras, a doorbell cam, and a thermostat in a guest room—the management process is not wonderful. It’s inflexible, things break, and the connections among devices feel fragile. Apple hasn’t managed to convince many more manufacturers to buy into HomeKit, which means the set of supported options hasn’t grown much, particularly in the doorbell market. Automations remain limited and frustrating about what you can use as triggers and linking activities. For instance, I’d like to set my porchlight to go on for some time in the evening to early morning but also have it turn on when someone approaches the house other times, then turn off within minutes after that if it’s not within the period it should be continuously on. It cannot be done (to my knowledge, testing, and inquiry). I feel like some X10 systems of many years gone by had greater configuration options than I can achieve in some cases with Home. Even setting up a simple “away on vacation” setting requires lots of grouping and programming, and I am unable to see how I could set up random on/off times, which are usual to simulate people at home. (Some third-party apps for HomeKit-connected outlets and lamps offer these features.)The new sharing feature, too, doesn’t let me share lights—only locks, alarms, etc. So someone can’t housesit and be able to access the house’s lights and such without a full invitation. I’d like Apple to put in a lot of rethink about Home in general and come up with something dramatically better that fits the quantity and utility of what HomeKit is good for. How would you rate how the Apple TV hardware and tvOS software platform went in 2024? Consider anything you deem relevant to the platform. (Do not address the Apple TV+ streaming service.) Matt Birchler: After a few years of tvOS updates making the platform more annoying and more clearly an advertising platform for the shows Apple thinks I should watch more than what I am currently watching, it was nice for tvOS not to move further down this road in 2024. However, I recently used Google TV for a few weeks and was shocked to find numerous features that I greatly preferred on that platform. I really do hope Apple is looking at competitors and finding the good stuff they can adopt in their box. Rich Mogull: There is not a single other privacy-preserving device for the streaming age. Not one. And the Apple TV works well and looks and sounds better than nearly anything else. Joe Rosensteel: Apple really isn’t making any progress on tvOS. I use my Apple TV every day, and it is the only set-top box I would recommend to people, but that doesn’t mean Apple perfected the form. Things are more or less in the same state they were in at the end of 2023 when the Home app was updated with that sidebar that mostly can’t be customized. We still don’t have a unified Home and TV app experience. We don’t have anything for live entertainment short of sports notifications. We don’t have any kind of firm policy on pause screen ads (see the YouTube screensaver controversy from 2024). Apple hasn’t enticed anyone new to add support for the jog wheel they introduced on the remote in 2021. James Thomson: Hardware not updated since 2022, software feels like it barely changes each year, and yet still the best streaming device to buy. Allison Sheridan: Nothing went wrong but it’s been two years since they’ve changed the hardware. Steven Aquino: The Apple TV box is laughably over-engineered for what it mainly does: stream content. I appreciate the horsepower, to be sure, but the point stands. Software-wise, I’m still holding my breath for tvOS to have its iOS 7 moment. The grid of icons UI is good in some ways, but on a screen as large as a television’s, there is a lot of untapped potential. Widgets, etc. Chance Miller: The hardware feels as uninspired as ever, but the Apple TV is still the best streaming set-top box. Everything else is a poorly designed, ad-ridden mess. The Apple TV app could sure use some love, though. Quinn Nelson: Little was done, but little was needed. Benjamin Mayo: A minor year for the Apple TV box with no new hardware in sight. However, tvOS 18 did include a handful of niceties, like automatic subtitles and a much better Enhance Dialogue algorithm. Casey Liss: The Apple TV remains a product in Apple’s lineup. I am an Apple TV apologist and superfan. Other than a couple of Nintendo consoles, it’s the only thing that’s connected to my TV. We watch live TV using the wonderful Channels app. We watch movies and shows on Plex, the infuriating Apple TV app, and Disney+. My wife and I do our exercise using a couple of apps on the Apple TV. It’s is our TV, for all intents and purposes. However, our Apple TV HD is getting really long in the tooth, and though we only use it on rare occasions, it’s still getting pretty painful. It’s our third-tier Apple TV, and I’m anxiously awaiting the time when we can upgrade the main one, and thus trickle our 4K first-gen down and retire the HD. We haven’t really had any noteworthy changes to tvOS in… years? While on the one side, I’m not sure what I’m really seeking; on the other side, it feels like Apple has mostly forgotten that tvOS exists. John Siracusa: I continue to be frustrated with the poor quality of many of the streaming video apps I use on Apple TV, both in terms of bugs and interface design. Is that Apple’s fault? Maybe only to the extent that these apps are using standard Apple frameworks for things like video playback. But Apple also isn’t exactly leading by example when it comes to user-centric design. TV apps everywhere continue to prioritize the needs of the streaming service over my needs as a viewer. I want to continue watching my show. They want to shove a bunch of new content in my face while making the show I was just watching as difficult to find as possible. And they don’t seem to care if they lose my place or fail to track my progress. And heaven forbid I go back to refresh my memory by watching a scene from an earlier episode. Now my current place in the series is apparently impossible for modern technology to discern. Craig Hockenberry: The only thing I hate about Apple TV is how every damn service has its own weird user interface. Still, the Apple TV is the best general-purpose entertainment device for the post-cable world. Michael Gartenberg: It feels like Apple TV has not only gone back to being a hobby but a hobby that you started investing a lot of money in and got bored with. I’d give it a lower score, but the Snoopy screensaver is cute. Rosemary Orchard: Still using my Apple TV from last year?! Paul Kafasis: I’m a big fan of the Apple TV. I’m willing to pay a premium over other hardware to get an ad-free, upscale experience. That said, I’d like to see some new hardware here. Michael Tsai: Nothing much happened this year, though I like the new feature of automatically showing subtitles when you rewind a bit. I still don’t like the software or the remote. Lex Friedman: My cable company discontinued its support for Cable Cards, so I switched to its cable-over-streaming offer. However, this functionality works only on iOS, Fire Tablets, and Apple TV. So, I’m now reliant on Apple TV to watch cable TV, which I use almost exclusively to watch NFL games. It works just fine. Marco Arment: Apple TV continues to be a product in Apple’s lineup. Andrew Laurence: Nearly all our TV viewing goes through our Apple TV 4K. In the “streaming box” category, Apple competes at 5-10x the cost of its popular rivals. As a middle-aged technology nerd, I value its user experience and privacy stance. My college-aged kids are content with the built-in TV apps or a $25 stick from Roku or Amazon. Apple TV can play more roles than just a streaming box; is the whole, in fact, greater than the sum of its parts? Myke Hurley: Steady. Adam Engst: I appreciate that Apple has finally improved its photo screensavers, but why does the Portraits screensaver, which works like the iPhone Lock Screen/Apple Watch Photos face, ruin every photo by displaying the time over it? Eric Slivka: No new Apple TV hardware for the second year in a row, and only minor tvOS updates leave us wanting as we await the home revolution of 2025. I would still like to see a cheaper stick-style Apple TV option. John Gruber: I’m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what exactly improved or changed in 2024? Anything? It may well be fair to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we’re grading what happened in 2024. Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote control for this platform. Christina Warren: Apple obviously cares a lot about Apple TV+. It seems to care a lot less about tvOS and the Apple TV hardware. Another year, more lack of updates on hardware or significant updates on software and a price delta between other boxes that doesn’t improve. Especially since Apple has good TV+ apps on Roku, Fire TV and Google TV — not to mention stuff for TV makers like LG and Samsung. Jeff Carlson: Apple TV still doesn’t feel like it’s changed a whole lot, but I still swear by it because it’s not the crapware that every other vendor creates. Stephen Hackett: For the 2023 Report Card, I wrote, “The Apple TV hardware has been so overpriced and overpowered for so long that it feels like I’m wasting everyone’s time by mentioning it again.” I also said, “tvOS continues to feel trapped between Apple’s vision for the platform and what it can work out with streaming giants like Netflix.” Yup. Carolina Milanesi: Nothing to see here – no pun intended! Andy Ihnatko: Until Apple decides to give Apple TV a mission beyond “run streaming apps and generally be invisible,” it’s a solid 3 out of 5 by its nature. I’m giving it a 4 because of the new Snoopy screensavers. Glenn Fleishman: I still find tvOS’s UI primitive, but I use it for about 95% of my video watching across many apps, and it generally serves the purpose. Feels stale compared to other options and sometimes frustrating in terms of scrubs and basic rewind/fast forwarding. This may be a function of app implementation, such as how YouTube stinks and others don’t. How would you rate Apple’s performance in services in 2024? Consider the App Store (from a consumer perspective), Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple Pay, AppleCare, and anything else you deem appropriate. Brian Mattucci: I’m thrilled that Apple Music Classical finally got CarPlay support, but it’s still missing on Mac and AVP. Michael Tsai: iMessage and Siri still work poorly for me. Apple Pay and the rest of iCloud are OK. The other services don’t interest me except that their existence seems to be warping Apple’s product design decisions. Craig Hockenberry: I’m not a fan of how pitching services has become part of the modern Apple software experience. When I check my stock portfolio, I don’t need to be reminded of Apple News+. Carolina Milanesi: The Apple TV+ lineup remained strong, and the sports win is important for Apple, especially in light of Vision Pro. I have some concerns around Apple Card and savings as Apple looks for a new partner. Matt Deatherage: Barely noticed any improvements, didn’t notice any regressions. Chance Miller: The prices for all of Apple’s services remained the same in 2024 while the quality of each continued to improve. Apple Arcade continues to be underrated, and I’ve found myself opening Apple News on a surprisingly regular basis. In particular, the election coverage in the Apple News app was top-notch. Apple Music excels in a world where Spotify continues to combine music, podcasts, videos, and other junk into a single interface. Kirk McElhearn: Still only 5GB based storage for iCloud, which means a lot of people don’t back up their iPhones. This is unconscionable these days and borders on forced bundling, requiring users to pay for extra storage. Even if it’s only a dollar a month, the mere fact that users have to enter into a regular transaction with Apple seems monopolistic. There should be options to use other services to back up the device. I have the basic Apple One subscription, and it only comes with 50 GB of storage, so I have to pay another $3 a month to get enough. This all feels like Apple is nickel and diming people. Matt Birchler: Much like the home category, I am struggling to think of anything notable Apple did in services this year, and I guess I think they’re mostly fine. Steven Aquino: I wish Apple would revisit the Apple TV branding to make it clearer. There’s the box and the streaming service, but I’d bet most people associate “Apple TV” with TV+ instead of the box. The TV app adds more complexity and confusion in terms of naming. Brent Simmons: Most of the services I’ve tried work okay, but I’m annoyed by all the advertising for them. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple is spread too thin, and a whole lot of these items are distractions that aren’t worth their time. Lex Friedman: Apple TV+ and Apple Music remain very good. Apple Fitness and Apple News remain fine. Apple Pay is wonderful. iCloud storage is still an issue in 2025. C’mon, Apple. David Sparks: I understand how important services are to Apple and Wall Street. I simultaneously fear how much building services revenue now enters the equation for new products. Also, the free iCloud tear of 5GB was first announced in 2011. That was 14 years ago. As a point of reference, the human genome project took 13 years. Dan Moren: I use almost all of Apple’s services, and they are fine. But very few of them make me want to stand up and cheer. It’s eye-rolling that the company still hasn’t upgraded that 5GB base iCloud tier. Myke Hurley: The content! It continues to be great. There are always Apple TV+ shows in my favorites of the year, and this one was no different. Slow Horses, Bad Monkey. Great work. Benjamin Mayo: Apple didn’t make a big deal about the personalized ‘New’ tab in Apple Music, but it makes a big difference. The app feels a lot more vibrant and alive, with rolling recommendations and suggestions relevant to individual music tastes. It filled a big gap in the Apple Music offering. Philip Michaels: If Apple silicon was the smartest move Apple did in years, then setting up a bunch of services with recurring revenue that tapped into all those installed devices was the second smartest Jessica Dennis: I still love a fair amount of Apple TV+ content, and sometimes Apple News+ comes in handy. I’m an Apple One Premier subscriber, and luckily for Apple, I have not sat down to do the math and come to the conclusion that it’s probably not really worth it for me. Shelly Brisbin: Apple offers enough services now that it’s hard to craft an overall narrative. Some, like Apple Music and iCloud, are great. Apple News+, which I want to love because I believe in a news environment where multiple platforms and ways of staying informed can thrive, hasn’t taken hold or made a compelling case for its own unique value. Also, on the negative side of the ledger, a recent issue with a subscription purchased through TV+ left me stuck in a limbo of automated prompts, with no easy way to contact a human. This is an issue plenty of people face, but Apple tends to get more of a pass than other companies, it seems to me. There’s no Genius Bar for services issues. Rich Mogull: We are an Apple One family. The storage expansion solved my biggest gripe. News is my go-to news app, and across the family, we make heavy use of all of the services except Apple Arcade. The privacy features of iCloud, like Private Relay and Hide My Email, are underrated. Passwords and Keychain sync are borderline disruptive. Marco Arment: Apple TV+ is the flashy star of the services, reliably delivering great new shows and seasons. iCloud and the service infrastructure remain the quiet heroes, working reliably behind the scenes to make everything else work so we don’t notice. But a massive chunk of “services” revenue comes from inconvenient truths that Apple wishes we wouldn’t pay attention to. Look at these nice TV shows! Michael Gartenberg: Most services are somewhat stagnant, which is why we see all sorts of bundles that bring services into users’ hands they wouldn’t necessarily buy, like Apple News. I was particularly disappointed that there’s a song on Apple Music called “Let’s Go Bomb Tel-Aviv.” I expect more from Apple. Michael E. Cohen: The plethora of services offered can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate or even understand. That said, I have had little problem accessing and using many of them. Roman Loyola: I guess I should stop waiting for Apple to increase the free base storage amount. Stephen Hackett: All in all, Apple is doing a good job with its various Services. TV+ is home to some of the best storytelling, and Fitness+ is inspiring and fun. iCloud syncs data more reliably than ever. Apple Arcade has become home to many rebooted classic iOS games, while Apple Podcasts has made the industry more accessible than ever. There are still sore spots, but none of them are new. iCloud’s storage tiers are stingy and oddly spaced out, and the ads in News+ continue to spoil an otherwise solid experience. Charles Arthur: TV+ has been disappointing. Slow Horses is the standout series. Most else is indifferent and uninteresting. Glenn Fleishman: Everything worked for me this year! Christina Warren: My continued line about Apple Services is that they are not best in class in any area. But the ubiquity and the way they work with Apple products keeps me paying. But in my mind, there isn’t an Apple service that is best in class in any way, and what I ultimately pay for is the convenience. I will give the new Passwords app a shoutout because I think it can replace a 1Password or Bitwarden or LastPass subscription for many families. I still pay for 1Password, and I’ll continue to, but for most people in the Apple ecosystem, I think Passwords is good enough. So that’s a bright spot. Everything else. Meh. It’s fine. But I wouldn’t call any of them best in class. Andrew Laurence: In the name of all that is holy, Siri and Apple Music’s default for “play this song” to be the most recent release version in my library needs to be stopped. If I say, “Play the song Born to Run,” the original 1975 release is the only correct answer. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to give some attention to the client apps for its “lesser” services on its “lesser” platforms. The Music app on macOS is in desperate need of some love, and iCloud Drive in the Finder is still maddeningly inconsistent and buggy. Howard Oakley: Apple’s ‘curating’ of the App Store remains lamentably poor and isn’t improving. John Gruber: TV+ is far from the biggest streaming service, but I’d argue adamantly that it has by far the highest batting average for quality content. Movies are still a weakness: “Wolfs” should have been great but was mediocre and forgettable. And that was TV+’s best movie of the year. But TV+ series continue to excel: Slow Horses had another crackerjack season, For All Mankind finished a good fourth season, and new shows like Dark Matter, Bad Monkey, and Presumed Innocent were all strong. TV+ is also a great streaming platform for small kids. iCloud, especially with iCloud Plus, remains secure, fast, and reliable. It enables so much seamless continuity (hence Apple’s “Continuity” umbrella brand for those features) across devices. But here we are again, with me repeating the same gripe from previous years: it’s miserly that Apple is still offering only a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier and has left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged forever. I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don’t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB? The Apple One bundle is a good deal, but the free iCloud tier should be genuinely useful for backing up a modern iPhone. And paid Plus tiers should now offer more storage than they do. Brett Terpstra: I really enjoy Apple TV+ shows, but I have moved away from Apple for news and music. There are just better services out there. I appreciate Apple Pay and my Apple Card, but the only changes in that area this year that I know of were APY decreases on Savings accounts. James Thomson: AppleTV+ programming continued to be a highlight in an otherwise lackluster—or, at best, stagnant—set of service offerings. Allison Sheridan: Apple TV+ is knocking it out of the park on show content. Developers can now confidently include iCloud syncing in their apps, making a seamless and delightful experience for users. Fitness+ continues to add new workouts, and the interface improvements make it easier to get to your saved workouts. Casey Liss: We. Still. Get. 5GB. Of. Storage. For. Free. On. iCloud. Apple services are mostly good on the surface. Fitness+ is great, although (like the Vision Pro) I wish more content got added more frequently. Apple TV+ continues to fire on all cylinders — as I write this, I just finished Shrinking season 2, and I am counting the days to Severance season 2. Apple Music is pretty good, but annoying issues with the app on all platforms wear me down. Any time music just doesn’t play — without any sort of error messaging, naturally — I get just a bit more frustrated. Thankfully, Spotify has worked hard to enshittify their app recently, so I am not feeling the longing I once did for a return to the land of the green and black. I know services are printing money for Apple, but the value for money for consumers is bad and getting worse. We should have had more iCloud storage years ago — especially at lower tiers. Every time I see a NEARLY FORTY DOLLAR bill for AppleOne, I die a little inside. Which means I’m dying a little inside twelve times a year. Nick Heer: As Apple’s services business grows, it begins to do things that feel uncharacteristic but are increasingly commonplace. Partnering with Taboola is one example. Flaky client software is another. Also, remember how lots of people were locked out of their Apple IDs in April, and we still have no idea why? Dr. Drang: I’ve been very pleased with Fitness+, which surprised me. I do wish it would get smarter about the kinds of workouts I tend to use and stop showing me stuff I don’t care about. I guess I should bite the bullet and build up a library so I don’t have to hunt. Rosemary Orchard: Puzzles, etc., are still not available outside of America!!! Quinn Nelson: Apple TV+ continues to stand out as the shining beacon of excellence in an otherwise neglected lineup of services. Federico Viticci: I switched from Apple Music to Spotify last year, so the only Apple services we use in our household now are iCloud storage with family sharing and Apple TV+. I love Apple TV+, but they should make a native app for Android so that I can watch their TV shows on my Lenovo media tablet. As for iCloud, I use it for Shortcuts, app integrations, and basic iCloud Drive storage, but I don’t trust it for work-related assets because it’s so damn slow. For whatever reason, with Dropbox, I can upload heavy video files in seconds, thanks to my fiber connection, but with iCloud, I have to wait a full day for those assets to sync across devices. iCloud Drive needs more controls and tools for people who work with files and share them with other people. How would you rate the overall reliability of Apple’s hardware in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the hardware working the way you expected? Were there issues? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Benjamin Mayo: Stellar year as far as reliability goes. I can’t recall any scandal at all, which is perhaps a first. Matt Birchler: It’s amazing how reliable and consistent Apple hardware is. The iPhone, especially, is made at a scale where basically no other product in the world matches, and it still releases on time and at very high quality without fail. Paul Kafasis: Apple hardware has been great for me. Marco Arment: We live in a golden era of Apple hardware reliability that’s so good that it’s easily taken for granted. No other consumer tech company executes at this level of hardware reliability. Chance Miller: Another year without any major complaints in this category is a victory for everyone. Rob Griffiths: Despite the foibles with software, I’ve only had one hardware problem in recent memory (a new Studio had a bad motherboard). Michael Tsai: My most recent hardware has been working well this year. My 2019 Intel MacBook Pro’s internal SSD partially failed. The Mac is out of AppleCare, and the SSD is non-replaceable, so now it can only be used with an external SSD, which is inconvenient for a portable computer and somewhat unreliable (with sleep, etc.). This would be worse with an Apple Silicon–based MacBook Pro because, for security reasons, they no longer support booting from external storage when the internal storage isn’t working. Without being able to replace the SSD, the whole Mac would be dead. Kirk McElhearn: I haven’t had any hardware issues on any of my Apple devices this year. Dan Moren: Hardware reliability has been solid for the last few years. I can’t remember the last time I had a hardware problem that was not caused by actual damage. (Sorry, MacBook Air screen.) Jessica Dennis: All my Apple hardware has been pretty much rock solid. Howard Oakley: Hardware problems remain surprisingly uncommon, as far as I’m aware. Christina Warren: I got my mom a 16GB M3 MacBook Air for Christmas, replacing a 2018 Retina MacBook Air — a laptop that, in 2018, had 8GB of RAM and that I paid extra to get it with 256GB SSD. Her new model fortunately got the Apple Intelligence-led RAM upgrade, even if 256GB of base storage is abhorrent in 2024. Anyway, the reason I mention this is that I was reminded of just how bad Apple’s laptops were 6 years ago. Butterfly keyboards. Chips that required loud fans to cool if they were in thin chassis. Performance that frankly peaked in 2015. I spent $1400 on that 2018 MacBook Air and it was never a good performer (we didn’t have any reliability issues except for a minor hiccup last year that made me learn the ridiculous requirements for rescuing a Mac that won’t boot post macOS 11) and I’ve felt angry about that basically the whole time she owned it. When the MBA got a RAM upgrade and Best Buy had a loss-leader price for Black Friday, I jumped at the chance to upgrade her and I feel like this is going to be an excellent laptop. It’s really a testament to the work Apple has done since 2020 or 2021 to re-earn their trust, at least as far as laptops go. My iPads, iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, and other devices have all had a good year as far as reliability goes. Federico Viticci: I have never had an Apple product fail on me, hardware-wise, in the 16 years I’ve been covering the company. If there’s one area where Apple is leagues ahead of its competition, I think it’s hardware manufacturing and overall experience. John Gruber: No news remains great news in this category. Stephen Hackett: Apple has long been a leader in hardware reliability. Now, with the company publishing repair guides and making parts available to end-users and small shops, users have more options than ever when something goes wrong. Carolina Milanesi: I have had some issues with the iPhone and AirPods, but nothing critical. Michael E. Cohen: None of my many Apple devices had reliability issues this year. Brian Mattucci: Touch ID is still mostly a miss for me on the Mac, even after upgrading to the USB-C keyboard. How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s operating system software in 2024? Were things better, worse, or pretty much the same in terms of the operating systems working as expected? Where there issues? How would you rate the overall quality of Apple’s apps, including bundled apps and apps it sells separately, in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate. John Siracusa: Apple really needs to shift the balance between new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Today’s Apple vastly undervalues the process of “polishing” existing features. There needs to be way, way more of it, especially on macOS. Craig Hockenberry: I never tell my wife about upcoming changes in Apple software. I’ve found it’s a good way to get an unfiltered opinion about new things, both good and bad. Let’s just say there was a string of expletives regarding the changes to Photos on iOS. I’m seeing a trend towards complexity in Apple software. The recent changes in Mail categorization made no sense to me—and they were enabled by default! I had a similar reaction to Focus modes, but at least that wasn’t forced upon me. It feels like the designers and developers at Apple know their products too well. I’m sure a lot of these changes feel important to the folks working on them, but to someone who’s not following the products so closely, it’s just a series of confounding hurdles. Dave Hamilton: I wish Apple would focus more on reliability and less on changing features that have just been integrated into our workflows. I appreciate that they don’t want to stagnate, but wholesale changes to what might seem like minor features (I’m looking at you, Safari’s “Add to Dock” functionality) can be massively disruptive to one’s workflow. Brett Terpstra: I love Sequoia. It doesn’t have groundbreaking features, but it was a painless upgrade that broke very few apps, and the minor improvements have been really nice. It’s kind of the same story on iOS. It’s nothing to write home about, but it’s reliable and has appreciated touches. Dan Moren: Apple Intelligence: There’s a weird sort of reality distortion field operating here. Never has Apple spent more time on features that seem important strategically but actually feel mostly like things people don’t care about or won’t use. I’m not a generative AI naysayer, but Apple’s features here are uninspiring and lackluster. The biggest thing they rolled out on this front was Private Cloud Compute which is truly impressive technology with, so far, very little to merit its use. Chance Miller: Apple lowered the bar for software quality in its race to ship Apple Intelligence features. There are genuinely useful Apple Intelligence features, like in-line summaries in the Mail app, but botched features like notification summaries are a plague on the overall experience. The new icon tinting and Home Screen customization options in iOS 18 are great. It’s easy to dunk on some of the uglier creations on social media, but I’m glad Apple has removed the guardrails to let people do what they want with their phones. Joe Rosensteel: Apple has been slipping on software quality for a while, but with the focus on Apple Intelligence, the quality control has really suffered. We can’t even point to Apple Intelligence and say, “It was all worth it so we could have this” because all the Apple Intelligence software isn’t just buggy but poorly conceived from the outset. Casey Liss: Literally the same thing I wrote about software reliability in 2023: New shiny continues to trump reliability. It’s not awful, but it’s not great. Same as it ever was. New this year, Apple Intelligence and Image Playgrounds are mostly a dud. It was clearly a feature done while Apple was on its heels — a way to say, “We can do that too! Look!” I actually mostly like the notification summaries, but every time I try to have fun with Image Playground, it ends up being a frustrating failure. Myke Hurley: Apple Intelligence has been a thorn in the side this year. There are features that I do like, but the overall sentiment is not good for many valid reasons. I like Notification Summaries, but I know they are okay at best. For me, though, Image Playground was a mistake. They should have been able to see this, and it should not have shipped. It’s a bad version of something that isn’t great to begin with. Michael Tsai: The software quality slide continues. The same old bugs are still there. Finder views still don’t update or reveal properly, and external drives still don’t mount reliably. macOS Sequoia brought new problems, particularly related to storage. Now, it’s sometimes impossible to unmount drives cleanly. Time Machine deleted lots of my old backups unnecessarily and had trouble completing new backups. Third-party backup utilities are also having trouble, as Sequoia broke ASR’s ability to create bootable backups. Multiple of my Macs now have regular kernel panics, which never happened before. There are a variety of new networking issues. Safari often stops working under heavy load, so, though it’s still my default browser, I’m increasingly incorporating Chrome and Firefox. I wish that, instead of focusing on Apple Intelligence, Apple had focused on improving the quality of the OS and on improving the design of Music and the other media/services apps. Rob Griffiths: Both are just sort of “meh.” Nothing earth-shattering, long-standing bugs remain, and the Mac continues its horrendous slide toward the iOS UI. Howard Oakley: Although OS and apps have been generally good, there have been some moments, such as the serious bugs in macOS 15.0 that had to be corrected early and the failure to progress other apps. Perhaps most disappointing is Apple’s lack of insight into what’s important to users: for example, macOS virtualization on Apple silicon continues to omit any support for App Store apps. While I understand the internal conflicts behind that (over authorization), I find it hard to believe that Apple wasn’t aware of them before it even launched virtualization. Yet, after enabling iCloud access in Sequoia, it has still not done anything about enabling App Store apps, which greatly reduces the value of virtualization for many. Paul Kafasis: As I said, can Apple get off the annual OS update cycle yet? Given the new features in .x releases in the past couple of years, it’s clear that even they don’t believe in it at present. We don’t need new OSes every year, and Apple can’t actually provide them every 12 months. Slow it down—it’s really OK. David Sparks: I continue to be impressed by Apple’s Productivity suite with annual solid, updates. I’m reserving judgment on Apple Intelligence until we see more. Rich Mogull: I have a lot of devices, and they have all been quite stable. Andrew Laurence: The Apple Intelligence rollout has been a FOMO-fueled own goal. The incremental feature rollout belies the aggressive advertising, the hoisted petard of notification summaries, the doesn’t-pass-the-red-face “beta” excuse, and the unknown timeline of fulfilling the 2024 WWDC announcements. As I type this, the lying eyes of Apple Intelligence news summaries are reaching the mockery strata once held by Newton poetry. Brent Simmons: Hardware quality is far ahead of software quality. Rosemary Orchard: I wish Apple would not push beta features like Apple Intelligence on everyone. My parents had it without me setting it up and were asking me if they needed a ChatGPT subscription for better Siri! Christina Warren: Putting the Apple Intelligence of it all aside — I think this was a decent year for Apple’s main platforms. Are there some regressions and annoyances in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia? Absolutely. Nick Heer: Apple’s computers are lots of things, but, ultimately, they are tools. I would like them to feel more confidence-inspiring. Apple Intelligence flaws are surely going to show up several times here. Setting that aside, I find plenty of bugs in Apple’s operating system, even in core features like window management. There was a wild layout bug in iOS 18’s Now Playing widget that shipped in public versions for two subsequent versions. I feel like there was a time when that would be more embarrassing. Nearly everyone I know was, at some point this year, prompted to use Check In and share their location with their parents; none of us live with our parents. Bugs aside, the introduction of yet more nagging security alerts in MacOS Sequoia continues an unwanted trend. My problematic opinion of the year is that I really like the new Photos app on iOS 18. Also, the new Mail app on iOS. I continue to ask whomever at Apple is available to please fix the Music app on MacOS. Benjamin Mayo: This year’s Sports app is entirely new, and I think it takes a pretty novel approach to a sports scores interface. The Live Activities on iPhone and Watch highlight the best of Apple ecosystem integration. Adam Engst: Apple Intelligence is disappointing, particularly given how much Apple has promoted it. If anything, Siri seems to be getting worse instead of better. Kirk McElhearn: Please, Apple, take a year off from flooding us with new features and fix bugs across all the operating systems. I’m tired of spending time troubleshooting tiny problems. And AppleCare support for this sort of thing has gotten abysmal in recent years. While I didn’t have any such issues this year, over the past few years, I’ve had numerous cases with AppleCare which were escalated to senior advisors, who told me that they would “take ownership of my case” and from whom I never heard back, even after emailing several times. There seems to be little accountability with AppleCare anymore. Quinn Nelson: OS updates are typically accompanied by new features—not the promise of new features. Allison Sheridan: Purely from my perspective, macOS Sequoia seems quite a bit more fiddly than previous OSes. Apps crashing, annoying popups about apps wanting local network access, and, of course, the bug in ASR come to mind. That said, I continue to be delighted with the features of Continuity. Features like having all devices share a clipboard, using a phone to scan a document directly into Finder, or being used as a camera are things I haven’t yet begun to take for granted. Stephen Hackett: Even with the addition of visionOS, Apple was able to move the ball forward across most of its ecosystem in 2024. Apple continues to ship features simultaneously across the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. Bugs remain, of course, but it’s been a long time since I’ve spent an afternoon troubleshooting something. Starting with the relaunch of Notes in the iOS 9/OS X El Capitan days, Apple has worked consistently on growing its first-party productivity apps into tools that more and more people can rely on at work. Reminders has gone from some sort of digital Hipster PDA with its card-based UI to a full-blown task manager, complete with robust sharing, a Kanban view, and integration with Calendar. Freeform came out of nowhere to take on some serious contenders from third-party developers. Safari is the true favorite child, with features added every cycle. Photos has become robust and even more useful with the launch of family sharing a couple of years ago. My biggest complaint is the lack of consistency across Apple’s apps. Look no further than Apple’s tools for smart searching. Editing a smart list in Reminders is weirdly different than creating a new smart folder in Mail or Notes, and on iOS in particular, Apple teams seem to be working from different guidelines when it comes to design elements. The new Sports app and Journal use gradients and color in fun ways, while much of iOS is still starkly white and blue. Messages is a hodgepodge of ancient message effects and fun, new text effects that operate in different ways in different parts of the app. It’s time for some UI cleanup across the board, even if that makes the Mac user in me a little nervous that the disease that is System Settings would spread. Jessica Dennis: The Apple Intelligence stuff is just so underwhelming so far. I wanted Image Playground to be like Google’s Emoji Kitchen, and it’s really, really not. Image Playground does both more and less than what I want — I want a crying cactus, which is a mashup of the crying and cactus emojis, and instead, I get a standard boring AI-generated image that looks like all the rest of the AI “art” (let’s not even go there) these days. John Gruber: Unchanged comment and grade from a year ago: I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple’s software design is headed (or, in some ways, has been now for years), but their software reliability has been very good for me. Michael E. Cohen: Stuff mostly works. But nothing’s perfect. Matt Deatherage: Apple Intelligence to date not only doesn’t live up to its potential, it doesn’t live up to the commercials Apple has aired. Dr. Drang: Apple Intelligence has really hurt Apple’s reputation on both the oversell and underdeliver sides. They advertised features well before they were available, and then when the features arrived, they didn’t have all their parts—a complete inversion of the “old Apple.” Matt Birchler: I think Apple Intelligence is a mess right now, but the rest of Apple’s operating systems are in pretty good shape, in my view. More updates to iPadOS and tvOS would be great, and parts of Apple’s apps (mostly Shortcuts) can be buggy, but I still use Apple’s platforms and am confident they’re the best ones for me compared to the competition. Lex Friedman: Image Playground is stupid. How would you rate the overall relationship between Apple and its third-party developers this year? Consider anything you deem appropriate. Casey Liss: Lol. I would give this a -5 if I could. Apple’s monopolistic behavior continues unabated — despite the EU’s efforts to… uh… abate it. Apple completely thumbing its nose at the spirit of the new rules, knowing full well how wrong it is, is deplorable. Even though I don’t concur with many of the EU’s rulings, Apple basically saying, “screw you, I’ll do what I want,” is incredibly off-putting. On a happier, if more schadenfreude-y note, it’s been hilarious watching the Vision Pro App Store colossally fail. Developers have been treated like shit by Apple for the better part of a decade, and Apple is now reaping what it sows. Why would developers do Apple a solid and go on faith this [potentially DOA] platform is going to be worth our time and efforts when everywhere we turn, they’re giving us the middle finger? I did the bare minimum for Callsheet, and I almost regret doing that much. Developer documentation remains a perennial yet solvable problem. It has absolutely gotten better, but it’s still really bad. Andy Ihnatko: 2024 was just a typical year in which Apple expected developers to be grateful for the lavish bounty that the company has so generously provided them and not make trouble. If Apple treated all of its customers the same way they treated developers — who are also Apple customers — we’d all still be waiting for cut copy and paste on the iPhone. Chance Miller: I don’t think developers embraced Apple Vision Pro with open arms like Apple had anticipated they would. Whether that’s because it’s a niche product or strained developer relations, I’m not sure. Probably a little bit of both. If Apple wants Vision Pro to mature, this is something that needs to be addressed. Dan Moren: Apple’s pushback to the DMA is perhaps understandable from a business perspective, but it makes the company look petty and recalcitrant. There’s a decided sense that Apple doesn’t know which way the wind is blowing as regards people’s opinions of Big Tech companies. John Siracusa: Apple’s continued resistance to the avalanche of new regional regulations being forced upon it is not serving the company well. At a certain point, it behooves Apple to embrace the changes and enthusiastically forge a new, more open path across all markets rather than wasting time and energy fragmenting its products and making things as difficult as possible for everyone involved. Matt Birchler: Early 2024 was all about Apple fighting the U.S. and EU at every turn to not give up any of the restrictive rules they’ve set around monetizing every cent they can remotely justify. I think Apple’s developers and product people love third party devs, but the business people seem to only think those devs should be thankful Apple permits them at all to work on Apple platforms. Marco Arment: Developer relations remain needlessly strained. Antagonistic positions and greedy policies from Apple’s executives continue to burn developer goodwill, trust, and enthusiasm that the developer-relations team is trying their hardest to retain, but there’s only so much they can do. Christina Warren: I was going to give this a three but the more I think about it, I really do think this is an area Apple most desperately needs to have some internal “come to Jesus” discussions. The utter failure of the Vision Pro from a developer perspective, coupled with the drama around not just emulators but also the DMA and alt-app stores, shows that the tension between Apple and their platform devs is in as precarious of a place as I can recall seeing it. To be clear, devs are still building amazing apps for all Apple platforms, and I think Apple platforms have the best software in the world (games notwithstanding), but the ability for developers to make a living off that software gets more difficult all the time. And decisions around areas like In App Purchase and subscriptions for content that should never have a 30% fee associated with Apple (for things like Patreon) feel beyond capricious. I’m glad for apps like Delta and third-party app stores that finally allowed emulators in the proper App Store, but the continuous problems emulator devs have getting their apps and updates into the store continue to be frustrating. Jason said it best when he wrote, “the App Store era must end,” and I co-sign that entire essay. (I wish I had written it; amazing job, Jason.) I’m putting this under developer relations because I really do see this as a developer relations problem. Vision Pro, even more than Apple Watch, shows that developers aren’t just going to show up and build apps for Apple’s new platforms anymore. And I can’t blame them. Nick Heer: What made me score this lower is Apple’s attitude toward regulators generally. I empathize with the company’s reluctance to make changes demanded by what it surely sees as meddling bureaucrats. But it has been obstinate in ways I think are counterproductive for everyone. For example, despite requirements to change its anti-steering measures in one jurisdiction after another, it is holding onto those policies everywhere else. In the European Union, its compliance measures have turned Apple into its own worst enemy. Craig Hockenberry: Apple is blowing it with developers. Full stop. Look at the general ambivalence towards Vision Pro as a manifestation of this – a new platform needs developers who are excited and ready to explore a product’s capabilities. This did not happen with the headset. It’s a cumulative thing: a lot of folks went into iPad development with the same enthusiasm they had for the iPhone. Then, they realized that supporting the device was a lot of extra work without a lot of extra revenue. Then Apple Watch came along… same thing. You now have a situation where developers are leery of a new platform. Now, throw in some unsavory maneuvers to avoid regulations that let developers choose their path with customers. The new App Store structures are designed by lawyers and accountants, not folks who create software. It’s no surprise to me that all the developers I know have a growing distrust of Apple. Apple is doing a lot of taking these days and not giving back to the developer community that has helped make its products thrive. Carolina Milanesi: I feel the negativity of previous years has dissipated somewhat Alex Cox: I have nothing constructive—I just don’t like watching friends getting fucked over for making things people love. Benjamin Mayo: They might be doing it by kicking and screaming, but the regulatory pressure is improving the developer ecosystem. For example, retro game emulators like Delta are now available worldwide on the App Store! Michael Tsai: The same old issues with the App Store, documentation, and bug reporting. Nothing seems to be getting better. This was the second year in a row that Xcode shipped with a showstopper bug for Mac developers. Once again, it was reported during the beta period, but there was no urgency to fix it. The Swift toolchain is still crashy and unreliable. Apple continues to write SwiftUI and SwiftData checks that the frameworks can’t cash. James Thomson: Apple continued its numerous legal battles with countries around the world to extract its cut of developer sales. It was forced to allow third-party App Stores in the EU, but then used supposedly neutral tools like notarization as de facto App Review, the Core Technology Fee, and surrounding rules to deliberately make them as unappealing as possible to developers. Apple should compete on merit, not threats. Charles Arthur: Vision Pro. EU DMA and the wrangles over third-party app stores. Enough said. John Gruber: Fourth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple’s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple’s platforms. The opposite is happening. The big change globally this year is the Digital Markets Act going into effect in the EU. I stand apart from many in the Cupertino punditry racket in applauding Apple for its compliance efforts. I think it has complied with a terrible law as best it can while protecting its own vision for how its platforms should be designed and work. (And, of course, protecting its own vision for how it should be able to monetize those platforms.) But even I — a guy who thinks Apple has done a remarkable job shipping an enormous amount of work in order to comply with the DMA — can’t and won’t argue that any of Apple’s efforts on the DMA front have repaired or improved its relationship with third-party developers. Despite the situation being largely unchanged, I’ve adjusted my grade on this subject from C to D this year because stagnation is catching up to Apple. More of the same is making matters worse. And I think we saw that with the relative dearth of native app support for Vision Pro. There’s a chicken-and-egg problem with a new platform like VisionOS. The best way to generate developer interest in a new platform is to sell a lot of units to a lot of users who are looking for apps to use and games to play. But the best way to sell a lot of hardware units to a lot of users is to have a deep exclusive-to-the-platform ecosystem of both first- and third-party apps and games. With previous new developer platforms, like iOS and Mac OS X, Apple powered through this initial conundrum by attracting developers who just wanted to create awesome new software for an awesome new platform. That enthusiasm was tempered greatly last year for VisionOS, and I think it was a lot more about how developers feel about Apple and the App Store than how they feel about Vision Pro itself. Howard Oakley: I’ve had no problems, but the App Store and its review process never fail to shock and disappoint. Rosemary Orchard: They have removed the limited number of requests for each developer (company) per year; however, there are still a large number of APIs without adequate documentation. (One line!!) Paul Kafasis: Sadly, Apple has been absolutely torching developer goodwill for several years now. App Store policies have not improved. Its malicious compliance with EU laws has been terribly disappointing to see. It knows what’s right, and refuses to do it, because it wants to protect every possible revenue source it has. It doesn’t have to be this way. How much is enough? At what point can a company say “We’ve won, we’re going to do what’s right, not what’s most profitable for the next quarter”? Sadly, probably never. Brent Simmons: The App Store monopoly continues in most of the world, and where it doesn’t, Apple is still an enormous prick. This shocking level of greed — combined with its obsequious behavior toward the incoming administration — is burning right through the remaining developer goodwill. Myke Hurley: Easily one of the worst years I have seen from them in a long, long time. And it’s all down to the DMA. Apple’s response to legislation is ridiculous. Using notarization as a way to stop apps from existing, the Core Technology Fee, and countless more dark spots. They should never have gotten to this step, and now they’re here I wish they would give a little more than they are. Apple executives claim that the company wants to leave the world a better place, and the company champions numerous causes. How well does Apple live up to its own standards in 2024? Consider anything you deem appropriate, including education and environmental initiatives, commitment to accessibility and diversity, treatment of Apple’s work force, and other political and policy stances. John Siracusa: While Tim Cook’s donation to Trump may benefit Apple, its employees, and even its customers, it certainly won’t have a positive social impact. Joe Rosensteel: I’m of two minds when it comes to Apple’s green initiatives. I think they’re great, but they do design systems where the whole thing has to be recycled instead of upgraded or easily repaired. I believe political and policy stances are really where Apple fell short in 2024. Notably with the European Commission and the trials involving the justice department. Like when we all found out how many billion dollars Google pays Apple to be the default search engine. At present, I can’t say I’m optimistic about the direction things are heading in terms of other political and policy decisions. Jessica Dennis: For a company that pays so much lip service to being green, using so much energy on very underwhelming AI stuff is very hmmmmm. And then, of course, there’s the million bucks Tim Cook sent to the incoming president — I guess he probably had to For Business Reasons, but it’s still gross, and I hate it. John Gruber: Apple’s efforts on the environmental front continue to strike me as extraordinary. Their accessibility features are so far ahead of the rest of the industry that I don’t even know who’s in second place. On social issues, by staying true to its longstanding, humane, common sense values, Apple’s culture has seemingly remained utterly consistent through a series of tumultuous years in our society at large, during which other companies have ping-ponged first sharply left, and now sharply right. If I stopped there, that would make for an obvious A grade. But: politics. I understand (I think) Tim Cook’s thinking and approach. I wouldn’t want his job, and I genuinely wonder at times who would. Sing-song congratulatory tweets leave a bitter taste, but I’m amenable to the argument that CEOs must play the cards they’ve been dealt, not the cards they’d hoped for. If you have to serve shit sandwiches, serve shit sandwiches — but don’t tell us they taste like pumpkin pie. Tim Cook can’t donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration slush fund when Apple donated a mere $43,200 thousand to Biden’s and expect us to do anything but laugh at the supposed justification that Cook “believes the inauguration is a great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in the spirit of unity.” That’s Tim Cook’s hoagie-sized shit sandwich to eat, and it’s disrespectful to pitch us on taking a few bites ourselves to help him get through it. I genuinely believe Cook is doing what’s best for Apple, and that’s quite literally his job. But it was true during the first Trump administration, and already is again in the second, that what’s best for Apple politically is in conflict with what’s best for the country and for the world. Brent Simmons: Seeking favor with fascists not only helps the fascists — it harms the world. Steven Aquino: From an accessibility standpoint, the AirPods Pro hearing aid feature has to exemplify Apple’s ethos of making the world a better place. It isn’t perfect, but the salient point is it’s tremendously significant the functionality exists at all. And it doesn’t take into account the continued work Apple did in 2024 to make its devices more accessible to the disability community. As I always say, Apple deserves more laudation in this realm than “gee whiz.” James Thomson: The push to ship Apple Intelligence has sacrificed a lot of Apple’s engineering focus and moral high ground in the name of boosting the stock price. Aside from many of the features not being in a functional state that should have been shipped to billions of people, Apple had a chance to lead the industry in terms of ethical training data and chose not to, damaging its relationship with the creative professionals who have traditionally been their biggest supporters. And in the end most people do not care about the actual functionality. But hey, the stock price went up. Marco Arment: Apple’s environmental work is very strong and commendable, but their continued strong presence in and reliance on China remains damaging and strategically limiting, and their explicit support and significant funding of the incoming Trump administration is opportunistic, dangerous, appalling, and spineless. Howard Oakley: Apple continues to champion several important issues, including the environment and privacy. However, there have been a succession of less glorious moments regarding the latter and a continuing lack of transparency. Lex Friedman: I continue to be disappointed by Tim Cook’s kowtowing to Trump. Alex Cox: Apple does exceed the on-the-ground bar that is “better than Meta,” but every year, they seem a little closer to the floor. Aside from all the political antics that the biggest companies in America all but “have” to do, I was most disappointed that there was no mention of how Apple Intelligence will impact their environmental goals. Most data on AI efficiency is all over the place, and I thought they’d have at least some information based on their on-device strategies. I’m no EACC bro, but as someone relatively excited about most LLM developments, it was disappointing that not even Apple felt they could address their energy use. Allison Sheridan: I was incredibly dismayed that Apple forced all AI developers from San Diego to move to Texas. Imagine being a woman of child-bearing age working in California and having to choose between your career and your health. I was disturbed enough by this to write to Tim Cook to explain what a horrific choice he had made. Zac Hall: Sometimes Apple reminds you that it is a corporation. Andy Ihnatko: Normally a solid 4, I’m docking a point this year. Apple’s Intelligence isn’t going to inflict the same degree of damage on the planet as Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft’s AI efforts. However, Apple utilizes those same AI foundries to build and train its models, so they aren’t entirely free of responsibility. I hope Apple’s 2025 Environmental Progress Report is transparent about the impact Apple creates as an AI customer. Rich Mogull: A 5 for general privacy, especially Advanced Data Protection and their partnering with Citizens Lab. 5 for environmental impact. A 1 for Tim Cook bowing to Trump. A 2 for their soft gloves with China. Shelly Brisbin: I’ll say here, as I always do, that accessibility, in particular, should be evaluated in terms of technology, utility, and effectiveness at making platforms and software available to all. It’s not about virtue signaling or even being nice for its own sake. So here goes: Apple had a good year when it comes to accessibility. That’s especially noteworthy in the Vision Pro’s varied and clever ways of providing access to a platform whose typical operation relies heavily on the use of eyes and hands. The company continues to tweak deep accessibility features, like this year’s Braille Screen Input updates. And AirPods Pro’s embrace of its identity as an over-the-counter hearing aid should give both users and accessibility advocates within Apple a lot of encouragement to do more. Paul Kafasis: I think Apple used to be better when it comes to global impact. I think they are now too relentlessly focused on squeezing money out of everyone and everything they can, to the detriment of everyone. They’re still better than most companies. They’re still pushing for environmental improvements, diversity, and more. But overall, they just seem much more money-grubbing to me. Brent Simmons’s post on this is worth a link. I think of it often. Dr. Drang: Did Tim Cook give more money to the Trump inauguration than to victims of the L.A. fires? Matt Birchler: I think it’s an overall win, although I don’t like how they treat software developers. It will be interesting to see how they play with the new U.S. administration. Christina Warren: I’ll be the jerk that says it: I miss the stickers, and I don’t think it was worth the so-called environmental impact. I am glad that FineWoven was killed (and sorry, but you’ll never convince me that the plastic they used for FineWoven was any more environmentally sound than just using the mid-quality leather they used before), but I’m equally annoyed the only way to get an official Apple Watch band in leather that isn’t an older model is by going to Hermes. Call me a selfish jerk (or worse), but I don’t think moves like removing stickers, moving to objectively worse materials for cases and watch bands, and forgoing previously included accessories (like wall chargers) — while still selling and trying to bundle said chargers independently — is the best and most effective way to reduce environmental impact. Or, at the very least, these moves feel like ways to cheap out and raise margins but under the guise of doing it for “environmental impact.” I’m glad Apple cares about sustainability; I wish it could care in a way that didn’t feel like they were using it as an excuse to cut corners and niceties. Carolina Milanesi: Apple continues to lead in sustainability, privacy, and the latest stand on not ending DEI programs. Philip Michaels: Given the current state of affairs in our new kleptocracy, I imagine this score will be very different in a year. Glenn Fleishman: I’m not in love with Apple’s current direction. The mandate to return people to the office seems counter to its environmental aims and discriminatory against employees of varying abilities, some of whom relocated. Apple’s adoption of AI, particularly partnering with OpenAI, seems shortsighted without specific plans in mind, given the impact on power usage. Michael Gartenberg: Apple’s impact on the world has gotten the attention of the DOJ and the EU, which is not exactly the impact they might have been aiming for, which is probably why Cook sent a $1 million gift to the new administration’s inauguration, including himself in the pantheon of tech CEOs all under scrutiny and all in attendance in Washington hoping the new administration will let them continue to have the impact on the world as they see fit. Matt Deatherage: if A.I. fits in with Apple’s pledge to be carbon-neutral in five years, they’re not making that well known when a lot of AGI opposition is about how much energy it takes. Casey Liss: Tim Cook donated $1M to Trump’s inauguration. Apple still relies deeply on China. Apple continues to think it operates above the law. Gross. It’s hard to be enthusiastic about Apple when this is how it behaves. Its move toward carbon neutrality is the only thing that kept this from a 1. Peter Cohen: Apple lives up to its standards. Tim’s personal ones left me puzzled. Myke Hurley: Carbon-neutral products are great. I am really happy they are able to do this with more and more. But storm clouds are swirling around: AI, legislation, and more. Apple is too big and too complicated to be a pure good force in the world. Michael E. Cohen: I’d rank this higher, but Cook is attending Trump’s inauguration, so…. Dan Moren: Apple continues to improve its environmental impact, but as with many of the other big tech companies, it’s feeling an inherent tension between reducing its footprint and increasing its reliance on AI, a technology that seems to be extremely energy voracious. I’d like to hear a little more about that when the company announces its next Apple Intelligence features. Nick Heer: This could be an essay. Scratch that — this could be several essays. This year, Apple made a big deal about its repairability and environmental bonafides, but it also continued to fight right-to-repair legislation, and we learned data center emissions are likely many times higher than claimed. Apple made contact sharing more private, but enabled by default a feature to remotely analyze users’ photos. I put my complaints about Apple’s European-centric measures in the Developer section, but they could easily go here, too. Stephen Hackett: The M4 Mac mini is the first carbon-neutral Mac ever made. It comes six years after Apple began using recycled aluminum in its Mac cases. The company continues investing in processes to make our world cleaner. On the social front, things are more complex. Apple continues to support important causes and will continue its DEI efforts, even as other tech companies are rolling them back. However, Tim Cook runs a company with a bigger economic footprint than many countries, and that means that Apple will play ball with the new Trump administration in ways some of its users will find disagreeable. It’s naive to think that a company the size of Apple would do anything else, even if I hope it rubs Tim Cook the wrong way enough to bother him. If you’d like to leave a comment about anything else, leave it below! Alex Cox: I think, finally, people are breaking away from feeling like they need to be a super fan of everything Apple does and every policy it has in order to appreciate the things they still do remarkably well. Eric Linder: This may be a bit meta, but there is something special about Apple that brings about a positive community that is critical at times, but only because of the love of Apple’s platforms and devices. I continue to applaud Apple’s environmental objectives and hope that as they continue to succeed, they really do continue to underpromise and overdeliver, not only with regard to the impact of its products and services but on their positive impact on the world. Andy Ihnatko: FREE CHARLIE BROWN! Howard Oakley: In 2024, the high point has been the release of the Mac mini M4, just months before the mini’s 20th birthday. At a time when Apple looked as if it was becoming obsessed with high-end experiments like Vision Pro, and AI, the redesigned mini is convincing many who have stuck with old Macs running High Sierra and Mojave to take the plunge and upgrade. The spirit of 2005 isn’t dead yet. Chance Miller: Apple’s 2024 leaves us with a lot of unknowns. Will Apple Intelligence live up to the expectations? Will Apple remain committed to Vision Pro? There are looming changes to the App Store in the EU, the DOJ case in the United States, and various other regulatory battles around the world. There’s a lot of uncertainty as we head into the new year, which is rare for a company as established as Apple. Rosemary Orchard: Developer relations are critical, especially with the integration of AI such as ChatGPT as a focus. Extending this to native iOS integrations (Siri intents please!) would be greatly appreciated. Allison Sheridan: It’s such a fun time to be an Apple fangirl. The speed and low power consumption of its laptop lineup are unsurpassed in the industry. Andrew Laurence: Apple’s Enterprise Workflow teams continue to do the Lord’s work. They bridge the gap between a remarkably difficult customer base and internal development priorities in which “the enterprise” is likely an afterthought, if it exists at all. We have become accustomed to new features having little to no available controls, and those that appear seemingly hastily bolted together. Apple is a customer-forward company but has yet to embrace the notion that the end user may not be the customer; that the customer may have primacy over the user, and the user is a risk being managed. Robert Carter: As I blind Apple user, I am pretty happy with the features that Apple added to accessibility this past year. I hope they will continue to use Apple Intelligence to enhance accessibility. Craig Hockenberry: WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET BETTER KEY BOARDS Zac Hall: 2024… not the year that Apple caught up in AI. Marco Arment: Apple Intelligence summary: Hardware is great; developers enjoy TV; missing vertebrae. Charles Arthur: The question I’ve really been asking myself towards the end of the year, and the one I want to ask Tim Cook, is: How would we know if Apple was becoming sclerotic? By which I mean that if the organisation has become unwieldy, unwilling to allow change, incapable of letting good ideas percolate rapidly upwards, how could we tell? We keep hearing and seeing how slow change is: it took an age for accessories to all get USB-C. The AirPods Max and the Pro Display XDR have gone years without being touched. Again and again it feels like it takes forever for even the simplest product upgrades to get out of the door. New ideas like the Vision Pro are hopelessly over-engineered, instead of being designed with a buyer in mind, which reminds me badly of the G4 Cube, which people loved as long as they didn’t own it; if they if did, they discovered the limited memory and some, the manufacturing stress cracks. But at least that Apple saw the problem and moved rapidly: the G4 Cube didn’t survive a year. Now it feels like a bad idea gets polished endlessly until it’s good enough to put out, and then is essentially abandoned. I worry about this. Of course, I might be wrong. But my question remains: how could we tell? What distinguishes a sclerotic Apple from one which is functioning fine, but incredibly deliberately? Kirk McElhearn: I think that 2024 was the year that I finally realized that the Apple of Steve Jobs is truly gone. The Tim Cook bot in interviews and presentations feels like an AI programmed by the marketing department; I get no impression that he really cares about products. At least the pre-recorded product announcements include many more Apple employees, but they all tend to have that same tone. I miss Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller talking about new products with perceivable love for the technology and what it could accomplish. I think Apple is so big right now that they can’t take chances. We grew up with a company that was constantly pushing the envelope, but now, at a time where there aren’t many new hardware features to add to these devices, we have discovered a company that pretends that things are “magical” too often. And you didn’t ask about Apple Intelligence. A half-baked bunch of mainly useless features in an attempt to catch up to a trend that Apple didn’t see coming. None of Apple’s AI features are original, and some, like Image Playground, are just childish. Apple is increasingly out of touch with what people really want to do, it seems, and I don’t see this changing until Tim Cook retires. Federico Viticci: I’m genuinely curious about what Apple is going to do with Apple Intelligence this year. Their first wave of previously announced AI features still hasn’t fully rolled out, and it’s fairly clear that the company is more or less two years behind its competitors in this space. While OpenAI is launching Tasks and Google is impressing the industry with their latest Gemini models and promising AI agents living in the browser, Apple is…letting you create cute emoji and terrible images that are so 2022, it hurts. That being said, I believe that Apple is aware of the fact that they need to catch up – and fast – and I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re witnessing Apple being an underdog again and having to pull out all the stops to show the world that they can still be relevant in a post-AI society. The company, unlike many AI competitors, has a unique advantage: they make the computers we use and the operating systems they run on. I’m convinced that, long term, Apple’s main competitors won’t be OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta, but Google and Microsoft. The Apple Intelligence features we saw at WWDC last year made for a cute demo; I think 2025 is going to show us a glimpse of what Apple’s true vision for the future of computing and AI is.

Title: DeepSeek’s AI Shockwave Hits NVIDIA Hard, Wiping Out Billions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/03/deepseeks-ai-shockwave-hits-nvidia-hard-wiping-out-billions/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T20:04:49Z
Full Content:
AI microprocessor on motherboard computer circuit, Artificial intelligence integrated inside Central ... [+] Processors Unit or CPU chip, 3d rendering futuristic digital data technology concept background The artificial intelligence revolution is moving at lightning speed, and one of the biggest stories from last week underscores just how critical the technology has become—not just for Silicon Valley, but for America’s national security and global competitiveness. Enter DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that’s sent shockwaves through the market with the release of a new, highly cost-efficient AI model. While DeepSeek may not yet be a household name, its impact has been swift. Nvidia — the dominant player in AI chip design and, as of this morning, the world’s third-largest company by market cap — saw its stock price tumble after DeepSeek’s latest model demonstrated a level of efficiency that many on Wall Street fear could challenge America’s AI supremacy. To understand why DeepSeek is making headlines, let’s look at Nvidia’s market swings. Last Monday, the tech giant lost an astonishing $590 billion in market value. Tuesday saw a rebound of $260 billion, only to drop again by $130 billion on Wednesday. The company plunged 15.8% for the week, its worst weekly showing since September 2022. Why the volatility? DeepSeek’s AI model, built at a fraction of the cost of leading U.S. models, signals the potential for a new price war in AI. Unlike OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama models—trained on expensive high-end semiconductors—DeepSeek has developed an alternative that is allegedly 45 times more efficient than its competitors. Its final training run cost only $5.6 million, compared to the vastly higher sums required for U.S.-made models. Cost vs. performance of select AI models For many investors, this raises big questions: Will AI’s profit margins shrink as efficiency increases? Are Nvidia’s high-priced AI chips at risk of being undercut? Most importantly, what are the implications for aerospace and defense, where AI is becoming an essential tool in modern warfare and national security? DeepSeek’s breakthrough isn’t just a financial story — it’s a national security issue. President Donald Trump wasted no time responding, saying DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call” for Silicon Valley. Supporting AI development, including the data centers that power it, is no longer just about business—it’s a matter of strategic importance. That may be partly why, in his second week back in office, Trump announced the launch of Stargate, a $500 billion joint AI venture led by SoftBank and OpenAI. Backed by Oracle and MGX, Stargate intends to invest $100 billion immediately into AI infrastructure in the U.S. The goal? To cement America’s leadership in AI and keep its edge in technological warfare and cybersecurity. But, as some analysts and investors are pointing out, if the Chinese can match American AI’s performance at a fraction of the cost, is $500 billion too high? In any case, the Stargate development should catch the attention of investors looking at aerospace and defense. AI-driven military applications, from autonomous drones to advanced cyber defense, are not just science fiction anymore. They’re already reshaping global conflict. The ability to train AI models more efficiently could shift the balance of power in how wars are fought, how intelligence is gathered and how cybersecurity threats are handled. Meanwhile, American tech giants are doubling down on AI investments. Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that 2025 will be a “defining year for AI,” with Meta planning to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure alone. The company expects to double its GPU capacity to 1.3 million chips by the end of next year, significantly ramp up AI hiring and bring 1 gigawatt of computing power online. The AI boom is already creating massive economic ripples. According to Sensor Tower, revenues for AI chatbot and AI art generators have skyrocketed from $30 million in 2022 — the year ChatGPT was launched — to nearly $1.3 billion in 2024, representing an incredible 4,100% increase. Sensor Tower reports that the U.S. leads the world in AI monetization, accounting for 45% of global revenue, while China lags at just 2%. Global AI apps are now a billion-dollar industry While DeepSeek has proven technically impressive, it’s also raised serious red flags. For one, Microsoft and OpenAI are investigating whether DeepSeek acquired data from ChatGPT in an unauthorized manner. And two, cyber intelligence firm KELA has already exposed major security vulnerabilities in DeepSeek’s R1 model, showing that it can be easily manipulated to generate malicious content, including ransomware instructions, fake news fabrication and even details on explosives and toxins. For this reason, U.S. military service members have been warned not to use DeepSeek AI tools due to potential security risks. Despite legitimate concerns, I agree with UBS that DeepSeek’s emergence does not derail the overall AI growth story. As its editorial team notes, AI is not a zero-sum game. A more cost-efficient model could actually accelerate adoption across industries, further fueling productivity gains and market expansion. For investors, this means keeping an eye on how AI is reshaping aerospace and defense. The biggest beneficiaries may not be the AI application companies themselves, but rather the firms building the infrastructure: semiconductor manufacturers, data centers, cloud computing providers, cybersecurity firms and defense contractors integrating AI into next-generation applications. With the U.S. making AI a national priority, we’re seeing an unprecedented wave of investment into the sector. Whether it’s OpenAI’s partnership with Stargate, Meta’s multi-billion-dollar AI expansion or defense firms using AI for military innovation, the message is clear: AI isn’t just the future of tech — it’s the future of national security.

Plus: Uncertainty Is Stressing Executives Out, Even If They’re Expecting Success; Tariff Talk Brings A Tempest To The Markets; Retail Apocalypse Predicted To Continue; Unions Score Wins While The NLRB Sees A Loss A new study from insurance company Sentry underscores a point that is likely to become a theme this year: Executives are optimistic about how their businesses will fare in 2025, but they’re also a lot more stressed. While almost half of the 1,000 executives and business leaders said they think their business will thrive this year, two-thirds are more anxious than they were at this time in 2024. The stress comes from many places. A total of 47% are under duress because of economic uncertainty, while almost as many—44%—say supply chain challenges keep them up at night. Other major stressors are financial—41% are concerned about the cost of employee health care and 36% point to inflation. More than a third are worried about labor shortages. The stress and uncertainty are keeping some executives from doing anything except working harder. Nearly all—97%—said they’ve deferred needed upgrades to their equipment, technology, cybersecurity or facilities. And almost half are asking employees to work longer hours. Findings of AlixPartners’ annual disruption index echo these concerns. Following the 2024 presidential election, the number of U.S. leaders who said they were more anxious doubled, from 23% at the beginning of 2024 to 46%. In that survey, 27% were concerned about shifting their manufacturing and supplier footprints, and 23% felt they needed to modify growth plans in response to U.S.-China relations. About 15% more said they needed to change their business model faster, and 12% fewer expect revenue growth this year. The whiplash of 2025 may end as the year goes on, or businesses will get used to the economic climate. However, the stress could burn some executives out quickly. The current average tenure of a C-suite leader is about four years, according to an analysis published last year in SHRM’s Executive Network, but in times of tumult and stress on business, it has historically been shorter. One aspect of business that has seen significant change is support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In the last year, many companies have moved away from their policies, and in his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump outlawed them in government. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about how this sentiment is reflected in boards of directors and C-suites. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs in the Oval Office. Considering the hours he devoted to talking about tariffs on the campaign trail and the massive changes made by executive orders so far, it’s almost surprising that Donald Trump waited two weeks to enact the trade taxes. The first targets were initially Canada and Mexico, which will see a 25% tariff on most imports starting on Tuesday, as well as China, which will get an additional 10% tariff. (Canadian oil tariffs will only be 10% to “minimize any disruptive effect” on U.S. gas prices.) Monday morning, Trump granted Mexico a one-month reprieve in exchange for 10,000 Mexican soldiers being deployed to the border to protect against drug trafficking. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs may cause “some pain,” but said it “will all be worth the price.” Most economists say tariffs tend to get passed through to the consumer, increasing prices for all Americans. Meanwhile, Canadian leaders have proposed a list of U.S. goods that will see their own 25% tariffs—including some food items, plastics, rubber, lumber and glassware. The tariffs were immediately felt on the stock market. Trump’s announcement affirming the tariffs Friday afternoon quickly erased a positive day on Wall Street, with all three major indexes tumbling. On Monday morning, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were all down more than 1%, with alcohol companies, vehicle manufacturers, tech companies and cryptocurrency seeing the biggest losses. The reaction to the tariff announcement reinforces the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s decision last week to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December, and GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation.” A Big Lots in Carle Place, New York that was closing last year. It is not expected to be a good year for retail. A study from Coresight Research predicts that 2025 is on track to see twice as many stores close as 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Up to 15,000 stores may close this year, while only about 5,800 could open. The study found that inflation, easy online shopping deals and suboptimal in-store customer experience are contributing to the closures. The year has already seen quite a bit of M&A in the retail space, Danziger writes. The biggest to date is JCPenney merging with the SPARC Group into Catalyst Brands. Higher-end brands have also been making deals—like Vera Wang’s acquisition by WHP Global, Stella McCartney buying back LVMH’s stake, Christian Lacroix’s sale to Sociedad Textil Lonia and Laura Ashley’s acquisition by Marquee Brands. Other brands that have been bought so far include Kapital, True Religion and Urban Skin RX. A Whole Foods Market in Commack, New York. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Egon Zehnder Global Head of DEI Cynthia Soledad. As scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion programs increased in 2024, the number of diverse individuals newly appointed to corporate boards decreased, though boards are more diverse than they were 12 years ago, leadership firm Egon Zehnder found in their 2024 global board diversity tracking report. President Donald Trump has also focused a number of executive orders on the topic in his second term. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about what this report means for diversity on boards, C-suite and corporate offices. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. There’s been a lot of demonizing DEI, but when you look at companies, a recent LinkedIn study showed nearly no companies cutting back on DEI. From where you sit, how does it break down? What are the actual feelings about DEI, both for boards and for corporations? Soledad: Starting with the corporate practices, I would say that the headlines are exaggerated. What is being called in a headline a “pullback” on DEI practices is usually not that. DEI work has evolved over time, particularly as regulatory and legal changes happen. For example, the affirmative action ruling a few years ago, and the subsequent legal test cases around corporate practices that look similar to affirmative action. Those regulatory shifts and changes in test cases do require companies to evaluate their practices and ask, ‘Is there anything that we would want to adapt and change because the regulatory environment’s changing?’ That's most of what I am hearing from the clients we work with: an evaluation given regulatory changes in the environment, not at all a rollback in terms of the importance of inclusive culture, diverse representation and continued investment. There is also a concern that, because of these headlines and sound bites, DEI is under attack and it affects morale. Companies are concerned that their employees will read these headlines and feel that these investments in inclusive culture are at some risk. I also am hearing from CHROs and DEI officers and CEOs that they are very focused on keeping employee engagement high, and helping those employees understand their levels of investment in DEI. How do you see President Trump's DEI policies in the federal government impacting the private sector? How about C-suites and boards? There is a ripple effect in the private sector partly because so many companies serve the federal government in some capacity, and these policies impact suppliers. In addition, these actions are obviously intended to sway public opinion. Even those companies who do not have government contracts will take note of the rhetoric, and their behavior could be influenced by the fear it is intended to create. The most direct possible impact is on corporate policies that influence supplier diversity, talent, and culture; impact to board diversity efforts could be softer. Nonetheless, these efforts are at some risk. Where do you see things going with the conversation around diversity, both as a policy in corporations, as well as with boards, in 2025? We can expect the landscape to continue to be fraught for the next year on this topic, with potentially more legal challenges to come. Because of this, companies will have to keep evolving their approaches. The commitment that companies, corporate leaders and board leaders have made to diversity and inclusion in companies is real. There is a core belief that companies are serving diverse customer bases, companies already have more diverse workforces than they have historically, and that they want to hold onto the best talent that they can. The core practices will remain steady. Companies are continuing to invest in building diverse pipelines of talent all the way up to the top, all the way up to board representation. Leaders say they want to protect that work, and to try to move through all of the distracting headlines as quickly as possible and stay focused on the core work.

February 03, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: A deep dive on DeepSeek and the future of AI

UPDATED 11:10 EST / FEBRUARY 03 2025 by Ryan Stevens The tech world was shaken this past week with the release of the DeepSeek chatbot, sparking intense discussions about its far-reaching implications. In the latest episode of the CUBE Podcast, theCUBE Research industry analysts John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right) break down what this development means for the industry, cutting through the hype to uncover the real impact. DeepSeek dominated the internet this week, sparking major discussions on AI, geopolitics and innovation, with its impact reaching from Silicon Valley to global markets. It put everyone on notice around AI efficiency, according to Furrier. “Is it a psych ops thing from China?” Furrier said. “Is open source going to change the game? There’s so many storylines. Is it a breakthrough?” All that dominated the Pod discussion this week. It’s possible that the release of the DeepSeek chatbot will bring with it some positives. It may teach everyone how to do things more efficiently in AI, according to Vellante. “That’s going to be a rising tide that lifts all ships, finally, because AI hasn’t lifted all ships as we know. It’s been narrow and focused in terms of those that have really gotten benefit from it,” Vellante said. “I think to the extent that we can lower the denominator … the value goes through the roof.” The real breakthrough here lies in DeepSeek’s use of a smarter, leaner model, according to Furrier. It was no fluke, having achieved the DeepSeek chatbot through smart model design and a mixture of experts. “They also did the distilling of other models, so they didn’t have to do the brute force crunching,” Furrier said. “They slashed memory, energy, and the time it needs to get the answers and reason with good performance without compromising performance. They get all that stuff … a lot of matrix multiplication involved.” The DeepSeek chatbot made a significant impact by combining innovative techniques in a way that wasn’t obvious, according to Furrier. It involved very clever engineering. “I don’t think it’s a breakthrough in a major way, but it was something that they did with the constraints that they had,” Furrier said. It’s possible that the developments lower costs and drive adoption, according to Furrier. It’s similar to what happened to the internet. “I was talking to some entrepreneurs this week. The classic AI trajectory, people are like, ‘Oh, it reminds me of the web,’ these critical moments,” Furrier said. “One entrepreneur said it reminds them of the iPhone revolution because the user experience shifted and that drove a lot of change.” People are saying that it’s a Sputnik moment, which may not be the best analogy, according to Vellante. But it does underscore that the development serves as a wake-up call. “Do you remember when in the ’80s, Japan’s ascendancy was freaking everybody out? I think this is significantly more competitive because the market is so much bigger and AI is so much more important today,” Vellante said. “But to me, the winners of the market, the market overall just keeps getting bigger and bigger the lower the cost is.” The DeepSeek chatbot news has driven several conversations over the past week. The conversation shifted from stock price impact to deeper discussions in Silicon Valley and the AI community about the true future of AI and its competitive landscape, according to Furrier. “What you’re starting to see is some of the things we’ve been saying on theCUBE here all the time, which is, it’s a systems revolution,” he said. “I call it the chip grid emerging, which is clustered systems, where it’s not about throwing gear at problems or GPUs. It’s the combination of the hardware configuration.” The event calendar for theCUBE is filling up, with theCUBE teaming up again with the New York Stock Exchange for a Super Studio event, welcoming Silicon Valley’s top CMO leaders innovating in artificial intelligence initiative on Feb. 14. This year marks the busiest tech event season for some time, according to Furrier. “Leading up to around 2018, I think, would be the height of the event season in terms of tech companies. I think we’re back at that level, Dave. I think we’re on the road every week in May,” Furrier said. April, May and June have tons of activity planned. There will be no shortage of things to discuss at the events on the calendar, according to Furrier. “There’s multiple threads, efficiency, software innovation, psych ops, global geopolitical Cold War race. I mean, this is all very interesting,” Furrier added. “Very, very interesting. We’ll keep track of it.” Antonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission Donald Trump, 47th president of the United States of America Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO and chairman of Apple Inc.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Erika Ayers Badan will share lessons from her seven-plus-year tenure as CEO of Barstool Sports — which she’s affectionately called a “pirate ship” — and other insights gleaned from her career in a new podcast series. Titled simply “Work,” Ayers Badan’s podcast premieres Monday, Feb. 3, with new episodes releasing weekly on Mondays. It’s available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Amazon Music (via this link). Indie podcast network Lemonada Media is handling distribution and ad sales for the show. Fair warning: “I’m gonna use the word ‘work’ a thousand times in this thing, because I love to work, and I love to think about work, and be at work and help people at work, and talk about work,” Ayers Badan says in the show’s trailer (listen below). She will talk through topics like “what to do when your coworkers are idiots, what happens when you hate your boss and what do you do when you’re stuck in a rut.” Related Stories VIP+ Visual Effects Workforce Isn’t Feeling AI Pinch Yet Federation Studios Teams With Alessandro Usai to Launch New Italian Outfit No Name Entertainment (EXCLUSIVE) “Work” also will cover a variety of topics including current events — like major corporations ending DEI programs, companies ordering workers back to the office five days per week, and “revenge quitting” — plus real-world work challenges she has struggled with in the past as well as those she currently faces. Ayers Badan’s guests on the podcast will include Lindsey Metselaar, host of dating podcast “We Met at Acme,” and Benjamin Kraim, founder of cannabis media and lifestyle brand WeedFeed. Popular on Variety In addition, Ayers Badan will discuss the backstories of sundry corporate jargon, like “circle back,” “bandwidth” and “EBITDA” (which, for the record, stands for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization”). “This is an unfiltered, vulnerable look at work and what it takes to make it at work,” Ayers Badan says. “Work isn’t perfect and neither are people but they both can be great. This show looks at what’s happening in and around the topic of work and offers perspective, advice and knowledge to those seeking to do more or be more at work.” It’s not her first podcast rodeo: At Barstool, she hosted “Token CEO,” a series that provided an “inside look on what’s going on at Barstool HQ.” Ayers Badan left Barstool, the bro-focused media company, in January 2024. That came after Barstool founder Dave Portnoy bought the site back from casino and gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1 (following Penn’s $550 million acquisition). Running Barstool under Penn’s ownership, Ayers Badan wrote in a memo to staff, “was a balancing act and kind of an exercise in futility — trying to generate bets at the same time as protecting a pirate ship while also subtly contorting it to be something more predictable, pacifiable and projectable to match with a casino company.” In April 2024, Ayers Badan was named CEO of Food52, a food-centered media and commerce company, after serving as a board member and adviser since 2019. “I have a brand-spanking-new job and what I wanted to do was to create a podcast for people who want to be better at work and want to make work a way to change and make their life great,” she says in the “Work” podcast trailer. She currently serves on the boards of the Premier Lacrosse League and public safety technology company Axon Enterprise (the maker of Taser weapons). Ayers Badan is the author of “Nobody Cares About Your Career: Why Failure Is Good, the Great Ones Play Hurt, and Other Hard Truths,” published in June 2024. Prior to Barstool, Ayers Badan held several senior roles at media and tech companies, including president of Bkstg, chief marketing officer of AOL, VP of Branding at Yahoo and senior director of MSN branded experiences at Microsoft. Lemonada Media is an independent podcast network founded in 2019 by Jessica Cordova Kramer and Stephanie Wittels Wachs. The company’s original shows include “Wiser Than Me With Julia Louis-Dreyfus”; “Fail Better With David Duchovny”; “Choice Words With Samantha Bee”; and “The Sarah Silverman Podcast.” It also recently announced Lemonada Books, a new imprint and co-development partnership with Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.

February 03, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until March 25, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk as well as certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

February 03, 2025 08:24 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: 2025 NFL Mock Draft: Shedeur Sanders, welcome to Cleveland

Time Published: 2025-02-03T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Cleveland Browns need a quarterback. They have the second pick in the 2025 NFL Draft — a draft with two clear cut quarterback prospects that have risen above the fray. Seems clear cut, right? But the Browns have several problems to address after following up Joe Flacco’s 2023 playoff run with a three-win campaign and the league’s worst offense. Cleveland has to surround that quarterback with playmakers and boost a once-proud defense. But thanks in large part to Deshaun Watson’s immovable contract — owner Jimmy Haslam handed him an unprecedented $230 million fully guaranteed after trading three first round picks for a player accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct dating to his time as a Houston Texan — the franchise enters the offseason an estimated $30 million over the 2025 salary cap. Keeping the second overall pick means not trading back and amassing the inexpensive assets that can guide the Browns from this place in salary cap hell. It also means putting a blue chip quarterback in a portfolio loaded with penny stocks. And that’s before getting to the fact one of the most outspoken personalities in football — a guy who could easily take aim at Cleveland’s myriad flaws and management issues — happens to be one of those quarterback’s very involved father. Despite all this, Shedeur Sanders? YOU are a Cleveland Brown. In this still entirely too early mock 2025 NFL Draft. Let’s see how the first round shakes out. Since it’s barely February, no trades in this lineup just yet. Let’s see which rookies make sense and where. Rich Barnes-Imagn Images Needs: QB, EDGE, OT, S, LB The Will Levis experiment was a valiant effort that ended in failure. Ward will run into many of the same problems Levis did — an understaffed receiving corps, weak blocking and an average-at-best run game foremost among them. But he also brings a higher ceiling to Nashville than the young veteran who’ll slide down the depth chart. Ward threw an FBS high 39 touchdown passes in fewer than 13 full games and added four more on the ground (and one through the air) in what would have likely been Miami’s best season in two decades had he finished up the Pop-Tarts Bowl. He didn’t, but that hardly matters; he’s a composed quarterback who’ll be an immediate upgrade in Nashville. Mike Watters-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OL, WR, RB, DT The Browns cannot separate themselves from Deshaun Watson’s contract, but they have to separate him from the starting lineup. A setback while rehabbing his torn Achilles took care of that, leaving Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson as the two available quarterbacks under contract for 2025. Winston is a viable but inconsistent backup and DTR was 2024’s worst starter by a significant margin. Thus, a team with several needs rolls with a boom or bust prospect in Sanders. The Colorado star’s penchant for big gains is tempered by his willingness to eat big losses in order to see those chunk plays through. That could lead to plenty of growing pains in an offense not set up to nurture him. Or he could power through and be a light in the darkness for a franchise dedicated to its own burial. Christopher Creveling-USA TODAY Sports Needs: QB, OL, CB, TE, RB, LB This isn’t the quarterback New York needs, but it’s a massive influx of talent that can spur growth on both sides of the ball. Hunter is some sort of mythical creature cursed to roam earth and he’s decided to make the most of it. He can punch up a young secondary alongside Dru Phillips (a rising star if 2024 is an indication) and Deonte Banks (a 2023 first round pick who regressed badly last fall). He can team with Malik Nabers to make life easier for whomever is throwing passes next fall. Head coach Brian Daboll is on the hot seat despite being 2022’s AP coach of the year. Finding the right way to deploy Hunter would give him job security and, importantly, give a tortured Giants fanbase something to cheer for after enduring six years of the Daniel Jones experience. Ben Queen-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, EDGE, CB, OG The Patriots have many needs at expensive positions — just not quarterback. That leaves them in position to trade back should a passer fall and a desperate team try to move up. Or, in this case, they can just take the player most likely to tilt the outcome of the game on any given Sunday. That’s Carter, the latest Penn State pass rusher to wear No. 11 and make life hell for Big Ten quarterbacks. His 22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks each led the conference thanks to a relentless motor, absurd athleticism and a general desire to hit fellas so hard they forget parts of elementary school. Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, CB, S, DL, WR Johnson was a true shutdown corner at Michigan. He’s a big (6-foot-2), athletic defensive back who can hold his spot in press coverage or off the line and breaking toward the ball. He allowed a 52.9 passer rating in coverage this fall, which is only a disappointment compared to his 30.9 rating in 2023. Though a foot injury has forced him off the field since mid-October, he should be capable of bolstering his stock with a big Combine showing. That would be rain in the Jaguars’ desert. Jacksonville’s 0.14 expected points added (EPA) per opponent pass play was worst in the NFL. While this may not be the kind of offensive toy new head coach Liam Coen may want, it fills a major need and gets the Jags one step closer to a future where they don’t need to score 30-plus points every week to win (unless they’re playing the Titans). Detroit Free Press Needs: QB, EDGE, CB, RB, S Do I trust a Mark Davis franchise to make a meat-and-potatoes pick at No. 6? Not really! But Graham is the best player available and, as a Michigan man, someone for whom Tom Brady can easily advocate. If that message gets through, it’ll be an unexciting pick that makes Las Vegas undeniably better. Graham would pair with Maxx Crosby and Christian Wilkins to bring screeching chaos each time opponents drop back to pass. At 320 pounds, he’s big enough to be immobile against the run. He’s also quick and explosive enough to blast through gaps as a 3-technique lineman between the guard and tackle. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, EDGE, TE, S, QB, OT The Jets need a quarterback, but reaching for someone like Jalen Milroe here when there are a few similar options who’ll be around when New York makes its second round selection (or potentially trades up into the back half of Day 1) would be a poor use of draft value. Instead, they can make life easier for whomever is taking snaps next fall and take 2025’s top offensive line prospect. With Morgan Moses and Tyron Smith both pending free agents, New York needs a young pillar across from 2024 first rounder Olu Fashanu. Campbell is a big bodied, 6-foot-6 specimen who can keep pockets, and his quarterback’s jersey, clean. We’ll see how the pre-draft process affects his stock. Aryanna Frank-Imagn Images Needs: OL, EDGE, LB, WR, ETC McMillan’s stock may depend significantly on his pre-draft workouts. While prolific at Arizona — 2,721 receiving yards the last two seasons alone! — it’s fair to wonder if his crisp routes will have the same kind of cornerback-snapping potentcy at the next level. Even if he’s not a burner, there’s so much to like about his game. He’s got a Drake London-style catch radius, using exceptional ball skills and his long frame (6-foot-5) to protect the ball from opposing players. He can work outside or baffle defenders from the slot. But if he can’t consistently create separation, could he be doomed to a Quentin Johnston or (long sigh) N’Keal Harry-type career? Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, WR, S, EDGE, TE Ryan Ramczyk appears destined for a medical retirement, which stinks. Taliese Fuaga wasn’t quite the answer New Orleans hoped as a rookie. With the franchise mired in salary cap hell, New Orleans needs to find young, inexpensive players at premium positions. That’s Simmons, who used Ohio State’s playoff run to gain a minor edge over similarly rated prospects like Kelvin Banks, Aireontae Ersery, Josh Conerly Jr. and Wyatt Milum. Simmons has the chops to fix things as a Day 1 starter both as a freshman at San Diego State and a transfer with the Buckeyes the last two seasons. He’s long armed and powerful with the low center of gravity that should help him recover from rookie mistakes. Brian Losness-Imagn Images Needs: OL, RB, OL, S, EDGE Sure, the Bears already have D’Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson. But the Detroit Lions already had David Montgomery in 2023. Look what former offensive coordinator and current Chicago head coach Ben Johnson did after they drafted Jahmyr GIbbs 12th overall. Jeanty is a monster, Sonic and Knuckles rolled into one (seriously: his 27 handoffs per game were only one fewer than Montgomery and Gibbs combined for in 2024). He averaged 7.0 yards per carry and has scored 30 touchdowns (29 rushing!) in his first 13 games for Boise State. Now he gets to ease the pressure on Caleb Williams’s shoulder and thrive for a team whose 4.0 yards per carry ranked 27th in the NFL last season. Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Needs: OT, CB, EDGE, DT, CB Is Banks a tackle or guard? That’s the question that will follow him through the pre-draft process and may depend on his arm length. Here’s the thing, though. No matter how long his arms, we know he’s a certified butt-kicker when it comes to pass blocking. He’s quick, powerful and perpetually aware of where his quarterback is, using that position to leverage edge rushers right out of the play. Banks has a low center of gravity, allowing him to pry up blitzers and dispatch them behind the pocket. He’s similarly stout against straight-on bull rushes, using his strength to absorb punches and redirect defenders. Oct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Anthony Donkoh (68), tight end Tyler Warren (44) and defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas (91) celebrate after defeating the USC Trojans at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, LB, S, OT, WR, RB Jerry Jones loves a flashy skill player. While Jeanty would have filled a need, Warren can do the same thanks to his ability to do just about anything across the offense. Warren has the ability to produce as both a receiver (79 yards per game) and runner (197 yards on 24 carries). In this case, he’d team with Jake Ferguson to give Dallas some juice in 12 personnel formations, flanking CeeDee Lamb with two tight ends and, at least in theory, making life a bit easier for Rico Dowdle next fall. This may not be the star for which the Cowboys hoped, he’d be a rising tide for an offense that desperately needs a lift. Matt Pendleton-Imagn Images Needs: QB, OG, CB, DT, S The bulk of Miami’s defensive line rotation will be free agents this spring. Calais Campbell is 38 years old. Someone needs to hold down the other end spot in the Dolphins 3-4 to help Zach Sieler continue to thrive (and Chop Robinson to reach his potential behind them). Scourton, at 6-foot-4 and 285 pounds, can be that guy (also considered: Arkansas’s Landon Jackson). He’s a big bodied defender who can hold his own against double teams in the run game or crash through gaps to flood the pocket on passing downs. He’s agile beyond his frame and as powerful as it suggests, making him a proper disruptor for a defense that badly needs it. Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, CB, EDGE, S Ryan Kelly, Will Fries and Mark Glowinski are all free agents. 2024 fourth rounder Tanor Bortolini could ascend to a new role up front, but more help is needed — especially for a team that needs to establish the run to open up the easy mid-range passes that have been missing from Anthony Richardson’s game. That leads to Booker, who may not be as exciting as drafting Warren or Luther Burden but still fills a major need. He can play multiple positions up front and create pancakes from all of them. He can play hyperactive at times, but he’s a bulldozer who understands his assignments. USA Today Sports Needs: EDGE, OT, DT, LB, CB Trading for Matthew Judon didn’t fix Atlanta’s pass rush. The Falcons ranked 31st in both pressure rate (28.1 percent) and sacks (31) in what proved to be another lost season. Keeping Williams in-state gives Atlanta another powerfully built outside linebacker with a high ceiling in the pros. The former five-star recruit is far from a finished project, but he should be able to provide the kind of strength and bend on the edge to win with power or quickness. His ability to contribute on all three downs is a boon, but his biggest value to the Falcons will be a growing arsenal of pass-rushing moves. The Knoxville News-Sentinel Needs: EDGE, DT, CB, LB, S Arizona needs a pass rusher and Pearce may be the last top tier sack-master in the 2025 class. The Tennessee star is slightly undersized at 243 pounds, but his get-off speed is a true problem and gives him an easy pathway to chase down opposing quarterbacks. He may not be a three-down player immediately, but he fits a need for a defense whose 31.4 pressure rate ranked 27th in the NFL last fall. Baron Browning and Dennis Gardeck are both free agents and Zaven Collins has 10.5 sacks the last three seasons combined (thanks in part to Arizona’s inability to find him a lasting NFL position). Pearce is a lottery ticket, but the jackpot here is large. Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, RB, IOL, DB Williams or Pearce would have been a boon for a Cincinnati pass rush that boils down to: a) Trey Hendrickson and b) end of list. Luther Burden could address the loss should Tee Higgins leave in free agency, though the Bengals may look to a larger wideout to fill Higgins’s shoes. That leads us to Starks, who has top 10 talent and could fill multiple roles in a depleted Bengal secondary. He’d be able to thrive in the slot or as an over-the-top presence or slide closer to the line of scrimmage as a run-stopper with strong tackling skills. He can do a little bit of everything, which is exactly what Cincinnati needs. Brett Davis-Imagn Images Needs: TE, LB, S, IOL Part of me wants to add Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to this offense — especially if D.K. Metcalf winds up quietly on the trade market this spring. But Fannin will likely linger on draft boards. Walker will not and he fills a need for a defense-first head coach like Mike Macdonald. The Bulldog linebacker can do anything from the middle of the field, whether that’s chasing down tight ends, filling run lanes or blitzing the quarterback (6.5 sacks in 2024). He’s a fundamentally sound, high floor player who can make an immediate impact. He also has the awareness and athleticism to be an All-Pro. It’s not a glamourous or high-cost position, but it’s one Seattle needs to upgrade. Peter Casey-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, IOL, CB, LB… WR? Green is a risk. At 248 pounds he’s a bit undersized. Playing at Marshall gave him limited reps against elite competition. But he wrought havoc in Huntington, recording 17 sacks in 13 games last season — including two against Virginia Tech and another against Ohio State. Green and YaYa Diaby would be a very different kind of edge rushing duo, but each is a high motor pest capable of disrupting the passing game. His explosive first-step and closing speed makes him a menace, so even if he can’t win with a bull rush he’s capable of shedding blocks and cleaning up from wherever he’s lined up. Jay Biggerstaff-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, DL, OT In this simulation, the Bengals passed on Burden because they wanted a wideout with a little more size. The Broncos, on the other hand, already have a 6-foot-4 Courtland Sutton as Bo Nix’s huckleberry. Now they get the 5-foot-11 Burden to add new depth and explosiveness to the offense. Burden is a shape shifter who can thrive as a sideline threat or devastating chain-mover over the middle. He’s got great hands and vision to pair with explosive acceleration for big gains after the catch. He’s also powerfully built blocker who can help create space on off-tackle runs. Between him and Sutton’s big body and red zone skills, Nix suddenly has a dynamic do-it-all combination to unlock the next step of his NFL development. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: QB, WR, RB, LB, CB, DL Three years after drafting Kenny Pickett in the second half of Day 1, the Steelers charge back into the breach. Pickett’s inability to process through his reads quickly ultimately put his NFL ceiling at “three good throws per game.” Milroe could fall into a similar bucket. There’s reason to believe he won’t. His mobility makes him a proper 2025 NFL quarterback. He’s run for 1,257 yards and 32 touchdowns the last two seasons, a number made all the more impressive when you consider NCAA stats count sacks as lost rushing yards. He can also deliver dynamic strikes downfield, which suggests he can slide into the offense designed for Justin Fields/Russell Wilson last fall and generate some success. Tim Heitman-Imagn Images Needs: WR, EDGE, OG, LB, S Jim Harbaugh needs an impact tight end and his former ward Colston Loveland remains on the board. But, TWIST!, here comes a star from Harbaugh’s old arch rival instead. Sawyer’s game-sealing strip sack in the national semifinal against Texas was the exact kind of high-effort, high-impact play the old school head coach cherishes. With Khalil Mack a free agent (and contemplating retirement), the Chargers get a player who had 15.5 sacks the last two seasons and who attacks running backs like he revels in contact. Reggie Hildred-USA TODAY Sports Needs: EDGE, DT, IOL, CB, OT Eric Stokes failed to live up to his first round draft status. Jaire Alexander played seven games in 2024 and looks like a pending salary cap casualty. While Carrington Valentine and Keisean Nixon can keep this unit afloat, it needs an infusion of new talent. Revel has All-Pro upside, but his draft stock is hampered by his place at a Group of 5 school and the torn ACL that ended his senior season after three games. The long-armed defender has elite top-line speed and can be an eraser on deep throws. He can thrive in zone or man coverage, using those arms to press effectively or accelerating to close distance (15 pass breakups and three interceptions in his last 15 games). Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports Needs: DT, CB, S, RB Morrison may be the last member of a thin second tier of cornerback prospects — not as good as Hunter or Johnson but maybe a notch above guys like Jahdae Barron or Trey Amos. Like Revel, he’s coming off a final college season cut short by injury after playing only six games for the Fighting Irish in 2024. But Morrison is an explosive corner who can snap off routes. His ability to close to the ball led to an FBS-high 10 passes defensed in 2023 and a directive to stay the hell away from him in 2024. He’s allowed a 58.4 passer rating in coverage this fall. If healthy, expect his stock to rise through the pre-draft process. Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports Needs: IOL, RB, DT, EDGE Membou has risen up draft boards as a tackle who handled his business in the SEC and can flex inside as a game-shaping guard. That’s exactly what Houston needs after a deficient line kept C.J. Stroud running for his life and stunting his growth after a dynamic rookie of the year campaign in 2023. The Missouri lineman is a lean 320 pounds, somehow, built atop a foundation of crazy athleticism. He’ll be a marvel as a pulling guard and a rampart in pass protection. While he’s still a bit raw, he’d bring All-Pro upside to a line that badly needs it. Matt Krohn-Imagn Images Needs: OT, CB, WR, LB, S Los Angeles managed to hold things together after injuries ravaged its offensive line. But Alaric Jackson is a pending free agent and Joe Noteboom has reached the void years of his contract. Factor in a 32-year-old Joe Havenstein and you’ve got a glaring need for high potential young players at an expensive position. Ersery has the chops to be a long term solution. He’s a massive (6-foot-6, 330 pounds) tackle who has improved throughout his college career. He’s got quick feet and sound technique along with experience playing both tackle positions. While his floor may be slightly lower than other blockers available, he could hang out as a swing tackle for a year before growing into his enormous ceiling as a pro. USA Today Sports Needs: OT, S, WR, EDGE Ronnie Stanley is a free agent. While he played 17 games this fall, he’d combined for just 31 the past four seasons. At nearly 31 years old, relying on him as a long term solution is an iffy proposition. Fortunately, Baltimore has the talent in place to make a bit of a luxury pick here. Conerly was the anchor for an offensive line that allowed just five total sacks in Oregon’s regular season. He’s a fast-twitch blocker who processes angles and reacts with the intelligence and foot speed to counter edge rushers inside and out. That gives him the chops to get out into running lanes and clear space for whomever is behind him — in this case, Lamar Jackson or Derrick Henry. Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports Needs: WR, LB, EDGE, DL, IOL Aidan Hutchinson will return from the broken leg that cost him the bulk of what was shaping up to be an All-Pro season in 2024. He needs help. Marcus Davenport was supposed to be Robin to his Batman, but was also hurt in 2024 and will be a free agent. Detroit could re-sign him, but additional bodies are needed. Jackson would be a massive addition, both physically and on the stat sheet. The 6-foot-7 specimen is long and angular but has a solid bend to keep his pad level low enough to keep his leverage. He’s quick and strong and can win inside and out. Now he’d get the chance to clean up the messes Hutchinson sends him — and create a few of his own. The Providence Journal Needs: DL, CB, EDGE, RB, S Washington may have bigger defensive holes to fill than at tackle, but Grant’s slide out of the top 20 presents tremendous value for a unit in dire need of upgrades. The Michigan standout is a 340-pound crime against physics to clog running lanes and shrink pockets from the inside-out. The Commanders need it. They ranked just 27th in run defense despite 2024’s breakthrough. Their 33 percent pressure rate was roughly the NFL average, but on par with their 32.9 percent blitz rate. Grant can help Washington get to the quarterback without sacrificing extra defenders in passing lanes. Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images Needs: CB, LB, WR, EDGE, S The Bills survived the loss of 2023’s starting safeties after moving on from Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Now Damar Hamlin heads to free agency and even if he stays creates room for an upgrade. Would Emmanwori be too similar to returning strong safety Taylor Rapp? Physically it would appear that way, but there are Kyle Hamilton traits to the 6-foot-3, 225-pound defensive back’s game. He’s got the top speed to be an over-the-top deterrent and the size and tackling to be a bull against the run. He’s also the kind of worker who’d immediately ingratiate himself to Bills Mafia, which is a bonus. Petre Thomas-Imagn Images Needs: EDGE, S, CB OT, LB Nolan Smith is evolving into a speed rushing nightmare. But Josh Sweat is a free agent (so is Milton Williams) and the pass rush around him needs reinforcements. There’s nothing general manager Howie Roseman likes more than adding a blue chip SEC talent to his defensive front. Umanmielen’s transfer from Florida to Ole Miss resulted in career highs in both sacks (10.5) and tackles for loss (14). He’s a wide-bodied edge rusher with a blistering first step and the hustle to stick with every play. He’s got a handful of ways to win on the edge, though none may be more effective than his spin. Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News Needs: CB, LB, RB, WR Nick Bolton is headed to free agency. While solid wideout and tailback options remain on the board, Kansas City has the opportunity to punch up the middle of its defense with a player who might be 2025’s best off-ball linebacker. Campbell is a do-everything monster who recorded 117 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, five sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception in 13 games last fall. At 6-foot-3 and 245 pounds, he’s a bulky-but-fluid linebacker capable of filling multiple roles along the linebacker corps. In this case, he’d pair with Leo Chenal to give the Chiefs two fairy tale-strong ball-stoppers in the second level.

Title: 4 Best AI Agent Cryptos to Buy as S&P 500 Turns Bullish After DeepSeek
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/4-best-ai-agent-cryptos-to-buy-as-sp-500-turns-bullish-after-deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T11:45:22Z

DeepSeek’s catastrophic impact on AI tech firms looks like it’s slowing down. After dropping heavily early last week, the S&P 500 has made a fantastic recovery and now sits very close to its all-time highs. The rebound was largely due to Big Tech stepping up, recording top earnings, and most importantly, reassuring investors that the US is still a leader in AI technology. All in all, DeepSeek might just be a much-needed boost for US AI firms to step up and do better. This also happens to be terrific news for AI projects in the crypto space, who will not only benefit from a dog fight between AI companies worldwide but also from the crypto economy’s overall bullish outlook. If you want to take full advantage of the upcoming AI-crypto rally, here are the 4 best AI agent cryptos you can consider investing into. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is already among the hottest presales of 2025 – and its popularity (and price) will only increase as the hype and demand for AI agent coins are set to skyrocket post DeepSeek’s launch and Altman’s promise of rolling out even better AI models. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that interacts with folks on online platforms like X and gauges the broader market sentiment. It then uses cutting-edge AI technology to deliver exclusive trading insights to token holders. MIND of Pepe offers two major benefits to token holders: 1. It offers 100% objective analyses, removing all emotions and bias from ruining your crypto profitability 2. It’s able to identify potentially profitable bets when they’re still at their early stages Currently available for just $0.0032532 per token, investing in $MIND could lead to crazy gains in the upcoming bull run. The project has already raised close to $5M. What’s more, early adopters will also be able to make handsome passive income through the project’s 457% staking rewards. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, check out our detailed guide on how to buy $MIND. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ($FET) is the largest AI crypto project on the market right now – it has a market capitalization of over $1.80B. This reflects its popularity and the vote of confidence from investors. $FET is truly a unique project, seeing as it’s a business alliance between three innovative AI companies: Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol. For context, alliances like this are not common in the AI space, which is still fairly new, meaning every company wants to race past the competition. Not only will this result in more transparency and innovation within the AI economy, but it’ll also level the playing field for smaller, resource-strapped AI companies. Where $MIND aims to offer crypto investment advice to retail traders like you and me, ai16Z is meant to simplify investing for venture capital firms. It will properly vet a company – including studying its financials and mission – to assess whether it’s worth investing into. Not only will this reduce the amount of human labor that goes into studying each prospective investment, but it’ll also massively increase the rate at which investment decisions can be made. Put together, ai16Z can very well be a game changer for venture capitalists. The $AI16Z token is currently trading at $0.38, which is a sizable dip from its all-time highs of around $2.45. However, it’s nearing earlier demand zones (like $0.2), meaning an uptick in price is highly likely from here. Freysa AI offers a fun challenge – convince the AI chatbot to send you money and that money will be yours! The tricky part, of course, is that you’re up against an AI agent designed to protect the very prize pool you’re trying to tap into, which is a pot of crypto. Freysa is admittedly tough to crack, but that’s exactly what’s fueling its hype. After all, who doesn’t love a real (and rewarding) challenge! That GTA V mission you’re trying to complete won’t earn you any money, but this will. The platform offers several game variations, each with a different prize pool – ranging from $7K to $50K. Interestingly, a user actually managed to convince Freysa to send him $20,843 by making the AI agent fall in love with him. With a market cap of over $270M, $FAI is currently trading at $0.034, which makes it one of the cheapest cryptos with massive potential. The larger trend for both crypto and the S&P 500 is expected to be bullish in 2025. However, no amount of market hype should overshadow smart risk management and investment hygiene. This includes only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing and doing your own research before putting your hard-earned money in crypto.

Title: Is DeepSeek China’s Sputnik Moment?
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-deepseek-chinas-sputnik-moment
Time Published: 2025-02-03T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek’s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek’s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as “not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China’s AI ecosystem.” As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed “outperforms” competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta “almost across the board.” Alibaba’s claims haven’t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China’s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports—a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described R1 as “super impressive,” adding, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.” The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,” which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being “first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,” and he argued that DeepSeek’s progress makes “export control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.” Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China’s remarkable transformation into the world’s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled “Another Sputnik Moment” to his firm’s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term “Sputnik moment” had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China’s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave’s piece said, “fighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.” In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because “it forced them to be very focused.” The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump’s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way.” By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn’t violate the U.S. export bans. “Did DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?” Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. “I think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,” he said. “You build a ten-foot wall; I’ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China’s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.” Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, “Engineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.” These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was “making it look easy” by training a “frontier-grade” large language model “on a joke of a budget.” Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn’t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn’t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to “engage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.” The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. “I’ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn’t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn’t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,” he said. “BYD wouldn’t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it’s a better car at a cheaper price.” Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. “It’s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,” Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. “That belief has been exploded as well,” Gave added. I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. “My job isn’t to tell policymakers what to do,” he said. “My job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?” Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. “The first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,” he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country’s banks to extend credit to them. “They said, ‘No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.’ ” Gave’s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China’s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. “When it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,” he said. ♦

Title: What's Next For CAT Stock After A Bleak Outlook?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/03/whats-next-for-cat-stock-after-a-bleak-outlook/

Caterpillar excavators are seen in Warsaw, Poland on April 23, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) recently released its Q4 results, with revenue missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $16.4 billion and $5.02, respectively. Lower dealer inventory levels weighed on the company’s top-line. Furthermore, the company expects sales and profitability to trend lower this year. Separately, after announcing good results, Buy, Sell, Or Hold ABBV Stock At $185? This didn’t sit well with the investors, and the stock saw a 5% dip on Thursday, January 30. CAT stock, with 29% returns since the beginning of 2024, has performed in-line with the S&P 500 index, up 27%. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Caterpillar’s revenue of $16.2 billion in Q4 was down 5% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 8%, Resource Industries sales were down 9%, while Energy & Transportation revenue were flat y-o-y. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 60 bps to 18.3% in Q4. A decline in sales clubbed with margin contraction resulted in earnings of $5.14 per share, versus $5.23 in the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar’s sales were weighed down due to lower dealer inventory levels as overall demand remains soft. This can be attributed to elevated interest rates and a high inflationary-environment. Looking forward, Caterpillar expects dealer inventory levels in 2025 to remain similar to levels seen toward the end of 2024. Taking into account the soft demand, Caterpillar will find it difficult to push the pricing higher. In fact, the company expects a slight decline in revenues this year, after seeing a 3% y-o-y decline in 2024. Although Caterpillar posted better than anticipated earnings, a top-line miss and a bleak outlook resulted in its stock seeing a 5% fall post the results announcement. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 4 years. But, that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, 26% in 2023, and 25% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could CAT face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for CAT to reflect the latest results, we think its stock is appropriately priced despite its recent decline. At its current levels of $375, CAT stock is trading at 17x trailing earnings of $21.90 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 19x over the last five years. However, a slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the underwhelming outlook for sales as well as profitability in the near term. While CAT stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Google earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Alphabet (GOOGL+0.31%) is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The Google parent’s stock was up by around 2.2% during mid-day trading on Friday. Alphabet shares are up by more than 8% so far this year. The company is expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.20%). Net income is expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimate earnings of $2.13 per share. In December, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, which it called its most-capable artificial intelligence model to date for the “new agentic era.” AI agents can complete some complex tasks autonomously for a user. Gemini 2.0's multimodal features, such as native image and audio output, “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,” the company said. With the new AI model’s reasoning capabilities, Google said its AI Overviews feature, which reaches one billion people, will be able to solve advanced multi-step queries, such as mathematical equations and multimodal questions. On Thursday, Google announced the rollout of its Gemini 2.0 Flash model to the Gemini mobile app and website. Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis, founder of Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, said its AI-designed drugs are expected to head to trial by the end of the year. “AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Hassabis, who also serves as chief executive of Google DeepMind, said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan.” Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, announced deals in July to work with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY+3.71%) and Novartis (NVS-2.23%) on drug research using its AlphaFold AI model.

Title: How corporate America got DEI wrong

By Maria Aspan An American flag flies outside a Walmart store in Miami. In 2020, Walmart was one of many large U.S. companies that pledged to fight racism and increase internal diversity. But now it, Amazon, Facebook and many other companies are ending some of those programs. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption Five years ago, in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the sweeping reckoning on racism it sparked, corporate America rushed to join in. Big businesses started making big — and expensive — promises to fight racism and increase diversity. Walmart, the world's largest company, spent $100 million on a new center on racial equity — and that was just one of many such investments. All told, the country's largest companies pledged almost $50 billion toward addressing racial inequality in the year after Floyd's death, The Washington Post estimated in 2021. And their CEOs announced these promises with solemn rhetoric about their companies' roles in fixing societal problems. "We want to address systematic racism in society head-on and accelerate change," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in June 2020. But today, corporate America is rushing just as quickly in the other direction. Mounting political and legal attacks have turned DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — from a corporate rallying cry to a politically toxic football. Many big companies had been backing away from their diversity promises even before President Trump was reelected. After long criticizing DEI, Trump last month signed executive orders that will terminate what he calls "illegal" DEI programs and policies throughout the federal government. He called the programs "radical and wasteful" and discriminatory against nonminorities who, he says, are denied opportunities and recognition as a result. Trump continued these criticisms last week, suggesting — apparently without evidence — that DEI programs at the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for a deadly airliner crash. It may seem that big companies are just adapting to political and legal pressure, but diversity experts also blame a more fundamental failure: Many businesses didn't think through their pledges — or their costs — from the start, they say. So corporate America may have never gotten DEI right in the first place. "What we're seeing in the moment is the few companies who took it to heart … and the many who just wanted to sprinkle some DEI on top, especially after George Floyd," says Portia Allen-Kyle, who runs the racial justice nonprofit Color of Change. "And that was never going to be a viable strategy." Allen-Kyle is pretty pessimistic these days about the future of DEI in corporate America, and the fallout for Black and other minority workers. But some diversity experts see a silver lining from the scrutiny: They hope that companies that care about building fairer, more inclusive workplaces are rethinking their strategies — and may now finally have a chance to get it right. Conservative critics have long claimed that DEI is itself discriminatory. But these attacks picked up momentum in 2023, when the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action at colleges and universities, ending the consideration of race in college admissions. President Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20. Jim Watson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption That ruling handed a powerful legal weapon to anti-DEI voices like Robby Starbuck, a social media influencer who has successfully pressured several big companies to end diversity-focused programs. Starbuck has said he is focused on ending "wokeness" in corporate America and has posted on X that his activism will give workers "a neutral workplace without feeling that divisive issues are being injected." Now President Trump's efforts to end DEI in the federal government are expected to ripple into the private sector. Walmart, Meta, Amazon and many others have already joined the retreat, ending many of their 2020-era pledges and programs. For example, Walmart in November said it won't renew the funding for its racial equity center and that it will end some other diversity-focused programs. "We remain committed to creating a culture where everyone can be successful, and ensuring we are a Walmart for everyone," a company spokesperson tells NPR. The other companies have said similar things. For example, in a note shared with NPR, Amazon executive Candi Castleberry told employees last year that "we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world." (Meta did not respond to a request for comment.) Under the political headlines, there's a more subtle undercurrent at work. When Floyd was murdered, many big companies were already promoting themselves as leaders in society, not just business. This widespread trend was known as "stakeholder capitalism": Companies argued that they could do more to help workers, society and the planet, while also making more money for investors. But many experts saw this rhetoric as fundamentally flawed — and, it soon turned out, largely ineffective. Paying workers more inevitably costs money and cuts into short-term profits; so does turning down business opportunities that could have a negative impact on the environment. Meanwhile, CEOs who take stands on social or environmental issues risk drawing the ire of politicians and customers who disagree. "It is always going to be difficult, if you are a for-profit publicly traded company, to have your leader talk about anything other than maximizing profits," says Sekou Bermiss, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "That is, in the U.S., the way we are wired." But when Floyd was murdered, big companies had raised the expectations of employees and customers that they would take a stand. And Bermiss argues that many rushed into promises without thinking through the costs — or what made the most sense for each individual business. Instead, some companies relied too much on the prospect of financial rewards for DEI programs, or what became known as "the business case for diversity." "It was being pitched as 'Diversity is always going to help the bottom line,' Bermiss says. "But no one [who studies this] would ever say that." Indeed, although some analysts have made the business case for diversity, Bermiss' research has found that when companies increase the diversity of their executive teams, they generally don't see a financial impact — good or bad. Still, Bermiss and others point out that DEI policies can have significant business impacts, even if they're not apparent in short-term financial results. Having a more diverse team can help create products that appeal to more consumers, or help employees feel more satisfied with their jobs. Costco, for example, recently told investors that its DEI efforts "help bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings" and "enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed," among other benefits. The massive retailer, which also calls DEI part of its "code of ethics," successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the nation's largest bank, has called DEI "good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it; we're successful." Costco successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption It probably helps that both JPMorgan Chase and Costco are financial powerhouses, whose profits and share prices keep their investors happy. But both companies are also framing their DEI policies as a matter of morality or ethics, rather than just profits. That's exactly how more companies should be thinking about DEI, according to Bermiss — if (and only if) they see it as valuable. Bermiss acknowledges that not all companies will want to continue pursuing greater diversity, equity and inclusion. But he argues that if business leaders decide that pursuing such workplace goals is morally right and aligned with a company's values, then they'll be better able to stand up to criticisms or attacks. And, as he adds, that's firmer ground than hoping that "if we get two more Latinos on the board, our stock price will go up." Despite the ongoing pressures, Costco and JPMorgan aren't the only employers still spending money on DEI. In fact, some companies are ramping up: Paradigm, a tech consultancy that advises employers on diversity and inclusion, says it saw a 12 percentage-point increase last year in how many of its customers had dedicated DEI budgets. Paradigm CEO Joelle Emerson says that even companies that are ending DEI programs may rebrand the work rather than abandoning it altogether. Corporate America's diversity results have been "a mixed bag," she adds, "in part because companies often spent too much time and energy on initiatives that didn't have a measurable impact." Now she's hoping that employers are taking the time to create more thoughtful — and effective — programs to increase fairness. "I see this less as a rollback of DEI and more as sort of an evolution to the next phase of this work," Emerson says. Many of the companies ending DEI programs are scrubbing the now-politically toxic acronym from their websites and corporate statements. But their public statements insist that they still want to make everyone feel included. That could be a tricky balance, especially as the Trump administration continues ramping up attacks on DEI — including efforts to uncover rebranded diversity efforts inside federal agencies. And it remains to be seen whether corporate America can really be more effective while softening its language — and goals — around diversity, equity and inclusion. But Emerson, at least, is bullish. "I'm actually pretty optimistic about the future of this work," she says. "I'm not optimistic about the acronym DEI — nor do I particularly care." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘I Think CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Is Going Up Big From Here’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer looked closely at. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the impact of President Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office on the financial markets. Cramer pointed out that while some investors had expected severe tariffs under Trump’s administration, many have begun to believe that these expectations may be exaggerated. According to Cramer, Wall Street initially became excited about a potentially more flexible approach under Trump. Investors were concerned that Trump might take a hard stance against Mexico and Canada, but as the situation developed, it became clear that his actions would not be as extreme as initially feared. He added: “Before taking the White House, he talked about putting 25% tariffs on our two longstanding trading partners immediately but then when the America First Trade policy memo came out, we saw that the administration wants to study the situation.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently Cramer remarked that although Trump had made bold statements about renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," his actual policies have been more tempered. Cramer noted that if Trump can find someone in Canada willing to negotiate, he would pursue that, and he’s already receiving business-like responses from Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. He added: “Again, the rhetoric was hot, but the reality was cool. Sure there are some real harsh words for a lot of the environmental rules and regulations and grants that President Biden jammed through the last four years. Trump has no time for these.” In addition to trade policies, Cramer also commented on Trump’s stance regarding environmental regulations. Trump has made it clear that he has no patience for many of the environmental rules and grants implemented during the previous administration. Cramer pointed out that Trump views oil and gas as essential to America’s economic strength, believing that increased drilling and production would lead to lower oil prices and enhance U.S. power abroad. However, Cramer acknowledged that it’s unclear how much influence Trump can exert over the oil and gas industry. He emphasized the need for more infrastructure, particularly pipelines, to facilitate both domestic and international distribution of natural gas. While oil executives are aware of the political pressure to increase production, they also know that any loss of discipline in response to presidential demands could lead to plummeting prices and financial losses. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on January 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Cramer mentioned that CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock will gain from here and recommended buying the stock. “I think CrowdStrike is going up big from here. I think that [the] cybersecurity business is terrific. I think that they are just now beginning to play offense after that glitch that occurred. I do think that this is the time to own CrowdStrike and to own what George Kurtz has built.” CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company known for its Falcon platform, which provides various endpoint security solutions. In November 2024, Cramer mentioned the company and remarked: “Hey, speaking of hating to lose the CEO of Palo Alto Networks, that's Desh Aurora, and the CEO of CrowdStrike, that's George Kurtz, are both extremely competitive. They know how to stop cybercrime better than anyone. I know it hurts our diversification efforts, but the Charitable Trust owns both these stocks because I'm a huge believer in cybersecurity and I'm not gonna be left behind by a great stock here. There's so much crime happening online. These companies literally can't handle all the business. Imagine that, I call that a high-quality problem.” CrowdStrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has gained more than 30% since its outage in July 2024. Overall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently looked at. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI-Briefing: DeepSeek’s emergence from nowhere shows open-source is eating the world

Time Published: 2025-02-03T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
In case you have been hiding under a rock for the past week, DeepSeek’s emergence (seemingly out of nowhere) has underlined the geopolitical aspect of one of the most disruptive forces in economic history. A key question facing the $225 billion-plus U.S. digital media sector is, how will its key players respond? Developments last week hint at such players adopting an open-source approach in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. Meanwhile, Digiday’s ad tech sources noted that, while DeepSeek poses a credible alternative to Big Tech, clients are in a cautious mood, particularly around privacy. The market disruption wrought by the technical feats of China-based DeepSeek’s new R1 large language model developed at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rival and AI talisman OpenAI and ChatGPT was demonstrated in stock prices. Notably, Nvidia, a leading supplier of GPUs essential for AI development, experienced a record one-day market value loss of approximately $593 billion, marking the largest single-day loss for any company to date. Meanwhile, the resulting impact on the market capitalization drops of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft — collectively, these companies dominate the ad-funded internet — were declines ranging from 5% to 10% in a similar period. The key to DeepSeek’s emergence was its open-source approach to developing its R1 model. This contrasts with OpenAI’s more proprietary strategy, where models are typically closed-source and access is provided through APIs. Despite the political tenor of the development, as exemplified by the privacy concerns flagged by Digiday sources, some of the internet economy’s foundational names are making moves that hint at an open future. For example, DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available on AWS, a sign (for some) of how the Amazon machine views others’ margin as its opportunity and will do whatever it takes to push its infrastructure strategy. One ad tech founder said potential clients are asking them to make sure they don’t use tech owned by companies like Amazon and Google, which makes having an alternative even more appealing. However, ad tech companies are still wary of using DeepSeek’s API and instead are looking for other options like running R1 on-premise. Elsewhere, some have noted the timing of Google’s Meridian — the online advertising giant’s open-source marketing mix model (MMM) — last week as significant. As Digiday sources recently observed, measurement is at the core of Google’s indispensableness in any media plan. However, as discussed extensively at last week’s annual leadership meeting hosted by the IAB, the loss of traditional audience-targeting signals, primarily third-party cookies, means Google’s ability to calculate how ads drive purchases is waning. Some interpret this embrace of the open approach from traditional walled garden players as a significant shift in their approach. Given the disruptive impact of AI on Google’s search hegemony, observers speculate if similar significant shifts in outlook can be expected from the titans of Big Tech. And the potential for downstream impacts are manifold, with ad tech sources telling Dgiday in separate conversations last week that they believe open-source models give them a chance to “control our own destiny.” Buy-side and sell-side sources told Digiday that R1’s transparency creates an alternative to black boxes like OpenAI and also offers them the opportunity to rely less on storing data with competitors like Google and Amazon. That doesn’t mean the Big Four won’t have a moat, but it does mean the moat’s eroded — at least for now. Meanwhile, OpenAI-patron Microsoft reported its latest earnings report last week, with CEO Satya Nadella declaring its AI business was approaching a run rate of $13 billion per year, up 175% year over year. This lofty figure failed to impress markets, though, as a comparatively modest revenue outlook for the coming quarter, along with residual concerns over the impact of DeepSeek, proved a drag on Microsoft’s stock price after earnings. Elsewhere, Apple also issued its earnings last week, and while its subsequent stock price fluctuations may have fared more stably than others in its Big Tech cohort, some noted how it will have to accelerate its AI deployment, i.e. Apple Intelligence, if it is to gain momentum. Given Apple’s increasing interest in the “services” sector, which increased 14% year on year for the reporting period to surpass $26 billion, and advertising in particular, it will be interesting to see just how AI will play a role in its Madison Avenue aspirations. Chris Vanderhook, COO and co-founder of publicly-listed ad tech company Viant, noted how the recent developments have been significant. “Because AI adoption is so early, they [Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.] didn’t get their hooks and claws into everyone yet,” he told Digiday. Some podcast execs expanding their video production efforts aren’t won over by Spotify’s push into video podcasts yet, due in part to growth they’re seeing on YouTube. The company believes more creators will make the jump to LinkedIn for the opportunity to be in front of marketers, investors and other business decision-makers. The Condé Nast-owned publication has recorded a four-times increase in revenue for its “Open Door” series and is planning a relaunch of its AD Shopping property, Astley said on the Digiday Podcast.

Includes a bunch of fast food including red rooster, Betty's etc. It has worked for me and I don’t have uber one. $4.50 for a big boss burger at burger point Marsden Park. No Uber One here and yeah, hard to find places that have it but looks like Betty's Burgers and Red Rooster at least. Thank you OP Not much available except drab burgers. Hopefully some better offers around dinnertime. Thank you for sharing. Yeah got it too. It looks to be associated with Ubers current Cher promotions. All I have in my area is HJ’s and Red Rooster. Actually, every time you close it and reopen it, it changes the places. Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Strange when I refresh the Cher page the options do keep shuffling. The places don't change for me, just some disappear and reappear upon refresh Got a whopper cheese delivered for $5, thanks :) Not a uber one member and got the offer looks like pick up too nice edit: went with Barnacle Bills Chicken Burger, Chips and Coke for $3.97. Bargain. Appears to work with more than one order if you add two or more orders to cart before proceeding to pay for each seperately. I paid for two separate orders and the promotion applied to both. confirm this works Got one as a non-One member. Filter by "Offers" and every store with "Save on select items" will have something that's 80% off Scheduled a Beef Bacon Cheeseburger and Chips (RRP $21.50) from my local pub for $7 delivered. First time I've used UE in months. Thanks OP. Note not all stores with "save on select items". There are stores with that badge that won't have 80% off. Ah sorry - I checked 5 stores and they all had a discount in them. I think maybe they were pizza/burger type places so just got lucky (or unlucky) I guess. Got two separate orders burgers only? Works for burgers and pizza. Managed to get 4 orders before it stopped working. Chargrill Charlie, Betty’s work too Wanna know why these types of offers keep being restricted so much? Because of (inflammatory) like above abusing it and then bragging about it. and yet they still keep getting the deal? This is something for uber to fix on their end. think I got it but just 1 store after few browses. Got Fat Jak Johnny cheeseburger for $3.42 ex delivery/services thanks OP!! best ubereats deal in years! 2 pizzas for $10 👍 Pizza for $1.39 delivered 😂 I didn't get the Cher banner (and I'm not an Uber One member), but was able to find that some stores near me (Red Rooster, Chicken Treat, HJs) had the offer available. $1.99 Whopper with cheese for me… Thank you for making me feel better about ordering uber eats tonight (I was going to do it anyway) Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Whooper is the only option at the time of writing. No sub and no use for long. Only offer in mine is 1.99 whopper. Has a $14.99 delivery fee attached, apparently due to current high demand. It’s 6.30am on a Tuesday. I’m an uber one member. No option for pickup. how do i get to it ?? Seems like its per day? Ordered yesterday - and the banner is back up again mine went from 8-10 options to just two after the first order. And no options for pickup. So it's confirmed promo not single use? Is it once per day or per restaurant (as in can you order from different eligible restaurants on the same day and still utilise the discount or does it re-set each day after single use)? I found that also, I've got 2 orders for Betty's burgers from two different locations on the same day, last time was yum Scummy of them to offer this only on the app which scrapes your data to sell to the highest bidder. I can access it on desktop too Where on desktop? I can't see anything with 80% off. from this link @CodeXD: Will give it a shot. Thanks. Edit: doesn't seem to come up on any of my accounts. Ordered yesterday, offer still shows today but much smaller selection (HJ’s Red Rooster and Betty’s) same Chargrill Charlie's is also on that list if one nearby, 1/4 chicken and chips by the way the promotion shows up on stores if you try to add items after ordering at another restaurant. I ordered two Whopper Cheese via HJ's, then I added a $5.60 meal from Betty's Burger, making the total to about $9 (without paying for delivery via uber one) You need to do this pretty fast before the offer expires, so I'd recommend those looking to use this trick to build the carts before ordering - it means you should just be able to enter each one and order before the promotion disappears. My local Hungry Jack's would let me add two Whopper with Cheese initially, but went I went to Cart, it said I exceeded the limit, and charges delivery + service fees. When I switched to an address in the city it allowed me to add two Whopper, charges service fees but not delivery fees. Got a Betty fried chicken burger (with pineapple) meal for $4.73 pick up. Good price. Got a woodfired pizza from the local Italian restaurant for $5.60 delivered. No Uber One.

Watch CBS News Updated on: February 2, 2025 / 6:24 PM EST / CBS News On this "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet. Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them. We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast. On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world. We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama – Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning. These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges. So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China. This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not," he wrote on his social media platform, "but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances. So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers? ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks. Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs – quote – "will put your jobs at risk," potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: "If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups." And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama? ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal. The Panamanians insist they have full control – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed. We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if – avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is a – remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower – saying he was going to lower grocery prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war. Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened. (Begin VT) SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is – according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor. FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional. SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen? FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden – she called him a brave whistle-blower – couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that – what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number – our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that – as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But – and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called – or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: … that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities – agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation – that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were – almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations? This would be devastating. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's – well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret – Margaret, it – we have seen – but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like – it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for. But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air – the crash. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them? SENATOR MARK WARNER: … without legal authority. Pardon me. Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to – is it being offered to air traffic controllers? SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is – I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs. What happens if they all quit? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you – and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment. I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away? SENATOR MARK WARNER: No. I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo. Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example – down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was – President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid. These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing… MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad… MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … when it should be the American worker's dollar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … which is a – separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell – yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents… MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently. And let's make another point on this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress – Congress authorizes and earmarks funding. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars – most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure. I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say – this is a little bit hyperbole – but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about – you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change. MARGARET BRENNAN: … efficiencies in aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's… MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what? MARGARET BRENNAN: But… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place? MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put – that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility – disability. Excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it. Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal – a personal aircraft. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. Good morning to you, Senator. Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe. But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: … not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator – Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it. Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break. I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen. (BEGIN VC) SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine? (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy. But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism - MARGARET BRENNAN: But - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that - MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower. And, by the way, it's not just health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address. MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane. And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out? FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of "The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions. Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, "line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do." Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here. But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation? SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning. Good morning. You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing? HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today. He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon? HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure? HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did. I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them. So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, "it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through? HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu. This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through. I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three. HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen - HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well. HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk. HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And congratulations. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's great news. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we go, "CBS Evening News" co-anchor and presidential historian John Dickerson has some thoughts on the tone of those Oval Office moments following tragedy. (BEGIN VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): After the deadliest air crash in 20 years in America, President Trump responded, as presidents have before. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Differences fade because we are all reminded of the basic truth, that we are all human and life is fragile. In such rare moments, a president can transform private grief into public meaning. These presidential moments live in our collective memory. Ronald Reagan addressing the nation after the Challenger disaster. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): George W. Bush at Ground Zero. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The nation sends its love and compassion. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Barack Obama singing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (singing): Amazing grace. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In speech, by bull horn, in song, and now, by executive memorandum. That's how Donald Trump used the Oval Office where Reagan had eulogized the Challenger astronauts. Though the president had earlier declared an hour of anguish for our nation, for him, the hour only lasted a few minutes. He spent much of the remainder of this unique moment distributing blame. TRUMP: I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The starkest claim, the one behind the Oval Office signing ceremony, that diversity programs had caused the crash that killed 67. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a presidential memorandum titled Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety. In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): When asked what proof he had that diversity was the culprit, and the president said he had no proof but didn't need any. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash. TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK. And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The president's certainty about the crash, despite the lack of proof, suggested for many Americans that the common sense he was referring to was that diversity means things automatically go wrong when people of color are in charge. In one press conference he traveled the entire length of the emotional register, from asserting that the differences between Americans fade to returning the focus to those differences. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Dub: the copy trading app that has teens talking

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Social media changed everything, from news consumption to shopping. Now, Dub thinks it can do the same for investing through an influencer-driven marketplace where users can follow the trades of top investors with a few taps. Think of it as TikTok meets Wall Street. Founded by 23-year-old Steven Wang — a Harvard dropout who began investing in second grade with his parents’ blessing — Dub is betting the future of investing isn’t about picking stocks but picking people. The app allows users to follow the strategies of traders, hedge funds, and even those mimicking high-profile politicians. Instead of making individual trade decisions, Dub users can copy entire portfolios. The concept has struck a chord. Dub has already surpassed 800,000 downloads and raised $17 million in seed funding — with a new round seemingly in the works. Less clear is whether Dub can avoid the pitfalls of previous fintech startups. Retail investing has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. The days of $7 trading commissions and clunky brokerage interfaces were blown apart roughly a decade ago by mobile-first platforms like Robinhood that invited people to trade for free. At the same time, social media is reshaping how people, and particularly members of Gen Z, make financial decisions. As a Harvard student during the pandemic — one who was trading from his dorm room “because you couldn’t really do anything at school” — Wang came to believe these two trends, retail investing and influencer-driven decision-making, were on a collision course. Between the GameStop saga, Elon Musk’s ability to “move the Dogecoin and Bitcoin markets with every tweet,” and people’s willingness to “really follow ideas and individuals to a whole new level,” Wang decided to drop out in 2021 and start building Dub. Right now, the platform’s average user is between the ages of 30 and 35, says Wang, though New York-based Dub is clearly finding its way in front of an even younger audience. In recent weeks, this editor’s 15-year-old has asked more than once about “investing like Nancy Pelosi” after marinating in Dub ads on Instagram. Pelosi isn’t personally trading on Dub; it’s just a trader on the platform mirroring her disclosed moves. Still, the idea has caught fire. “Nancy Pelosi is up 123% on Dub with real capital,” says Wang, “and we’ve made our customers millions of dollars since that portfolio was launched on the platform.” Dub isn’t free. Wang was determined to generate revenue from the outset, and Dub does that today through a $10-per-month subscription model. Wang says further that some “top” portfolios on the platform charge management fees and Dub takes a 25% cut of those fees. In the meantime, Dub has scaled in part through organic growth. “Creators who are good traders on the app are incentivized to bring their audience,” says Wang, whose parents immigrated from China and who grew up in Detroit. Dub is also investing aggressively in advertising, leaning heavily into Meta ads in particular to acquire users, including on Instagram. “We’ve been really lucky where I think the broader American population really believes there are other people out there that have an edge over them when it comes to the investing world,” says Wang. The question now is whether Dub will follow a similar path as other fast-growing fintech startups, many of which have found themselves in the crosshairs of regulators. Robinhood disrupted finance by making trading free, but it also faced regulatory scrutiny ahead of its 2021 IPO, ultimately ditching a feature that showered users with digital confetti every time they made a trade. Dub says it’s keen to avoid the same mistakes. The company spent more than two years working with FINRA and the SEC before launching, ensuring its model complied with financial regulations. “We didn’t just navigate regulation at Dub — we embraced it,” Wang says. (Like Robinhood, Dub is a fully licensed broker-dealer.) A big distinction, argues Wang, is that Dub is designed to educate users, not just encourage blind speculation. The platform displays risk scores, risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio stability metrics to help investors make informed decisions, he says. He suggests it’s safer for investors than Robinhood. Says Wang: “I have a lot of respect for what [CEO] Vlad [Tenev] has done in making trading free. But at the end of the day, making it super easy to trade without expert guidance, without education, is really just gambling for the broader population.” To underscore his point, Wang points to the decision of Robinhood — along with Coinbase and other exchanges — to make the meme coin TRUMP available for customers ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While it initially surged in price, its price has plummeted since. Says Wang, “I think fundamentally the incentives are just misaligned between these big platforms that are public companies now that need to make money” and that “generally” their customers have “probably lost money.” (Worth noting: In a separate, recent conversation with Robinhood’s Tenev about Dub, Tenev proposed to TechCrunch that copy trading could become of greater interest to regulators and that Dub may not yet be under the “magnifying glass” because of its comparatively smaller size.) Either way, not everyone is sold on Dub’s vision. The biggest knock against such platforms, says critics, is that stock picking underperforms passive investing over the long run, with studies showing that most actively managed funds fail to beat the S&P 500. It’s a criticism with which Wang is familiar — and on which he’s quick to push back. For one thing, he argues that many such studies are “cherry-picked.” (“I bet a lot of those are sponsored by the passive investing index companies,” he says.) Further, says Wang, there’s a reason that actively managed hedge funds like Citadel are thriving. “If you look at what the ultra wealthy can do, they’re giving their money to Ken Griffin of Citadel, [because] they’re consistently putting up non-correlated returns year after year after year,” he says. If one more broadly “looks at the growth of the hedge fund space and the asset management space,” continues Wang, “there’s a reason why it’s growing. It’s because they are making money for their customers.” Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks For The Next 5 Years
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-for-next-5-years/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1.

Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: What's in store for remote work and RTO in 2025: 'Hybrid will be dominant,' says expert

Related Stories With the new year comes new goals, and for some CEOs that includes issuing fresh return-to-office mandates for their workers. In recent months, companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell and Walmart have called select staffers into the office five days a week. RTO marching orders reached the White House after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all department and agency heads in the executive branch to "terminate remote work arrangements" and require workers report to offices full-time "as soon as practicable." Shortly after, the Trump administration offered buyouts to nearly all civilian federal workers to quit by Feb. 6. The trend could trigger waves of quitting and disengagement at work, though, experts warn, especially among high performers. Nearly half, 46%, of hybrid and remote workers said they would be unlikely to stay in their job if their employer called them back to offices full-time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,200 people in October. Some companies may hope that work-from-home holdouts will quit rather than comply. Companies that plan to cut hiring significantly are more likely to impose RTO mandates than expand remote-work opportunities, according to research from ZipRecruiter; they also report higher turnover rates. In the past, the workers most likely to quit after the institution of an RTO mandate tended to be highly skilled and tenured star employees, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh. The study, which analyzed companies in the S&P 500, found firms that cut workplace flexibility experienced "abnormally high turnover," especially among women, senior and skilled employees. These companies took "significantly longer" to fill vacancies and saw their hire rates "significantly decrease," researchers noted. Thanks to a tougher job market for workers than a few years ago, those who want to quit but don't have anywhere to go are likely to stay and be a drain on worker engagement, says Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. "I might try to do the minimum so I won't be fired, then start looking for the next job. And once I find a better position, I will leave," Ma says. "So it's not an ideal situation for the employer." A better approach to reducing headcount is to conduct targeted layoffs of lower performers, Ma says. As of October 2024, a majority of workers, 53%, said finding a new job they want would be difficult, up from 37% of people who felt that way in 2022, according to Pew data. That's unlikely to entirely deter the nearly half of workers who would try to quit given stricter RTO mandates from their company. "It shows how much they really do value the flexibility that comes with hybrid work," says Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center. Generally, Ma expects "some form of hybrid will be dominant, rather than a five-day return-to-office." Of the S&P 500 firms he and his co-researchers studied in 2024, just 10 announced full-time returns for some of its staff throughout the year, he says. "Based on the data we are observing, I do not think the majority of companies will do that," he says. "Most firms have already figured out their hybrid policy by now. Unless something goes wrong, I don't think they will try to change that position." While 31% of businesses reduced remote-work options in 2024, 33% expanded them, according to ZipRecruiter data compiled from more than 2,000 hiring managers. Bigger companies may have more leverage to issue RTO requirements because they can offer more money and still attract a larger candidate pool, Ma says. However, smaller companies that can't offer as competitive pay might instead offer more flexibility as a non-salary benefit to attract hires. "Not many small firms are following," Ma says.

Title: Why Are Analysts Bullish on MGM Resorts International (MGM) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. 2024 was a memorable year for the broad market index, which posted a gain of 23.31%, building on the 24.2% return in 2023. The two-year surge of over 53% is the best performance for the index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998. READ ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. The broader market rose 0.5% on January 23, going past its peak in December to a new record high. The gain added to the week-long winning momentum after data showed inflation slowing in the country more than economists had anticipated. With this rise, the index is up 4% since the start of the year. Investor sentiment has also been bolstered with President Trump reiterating his commitment to lowering oil prices and further cutting interest rates. The 78-year-old is also taking his time over tariffs by holding them off until February. Analysts believe a less aggressive approach than some had expected has helped the market move higher. Here is what Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, had to say: "He really can’t control interest rates, but the market likes to hear that kind of stuff. So far, the market does seem to like what Trump’s policies are going to be, so we’ll just have to see if there’s some follow-through." A string of strong corporate earnings reports has also supported the gains in January. According to data from FactSet, earnings for companies listed on the index are on track to grow by over 12% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. If that happens, this would mark the best quarter for company profits since 2021. While the overall outlook for the stock market looks encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the rally having gone too far, and a correction is in the offing this year. The threat of fierce trade wars sparked by tariffs, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and broader inflationary pressures could also hurt the market. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro for Fidelity Management & Research Company wrote the following in a note on December 18. "Personally, I am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don’t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year. And I think there are important risks from inflation, and the market’s concentration, to be aware of." For this article, we went through the list of large cap stocks on the broader market index and picked the top 12 with the highest average share price upside potential. All data is as of the close of the day on Friday, January 31, 2025. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price upside potential.

Title: Trump tariffs, more Big Tech earnings, and a jobs report: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow. Monday Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.1 expected, 50.1 previously); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (0.2% expected, 0% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (49.3 expected, 49.3 prior) Earnings: The Clorox Company (CLX), Palantir (PLTR), Tyson (TSN) Tuesday Economic data: Job openings, December (8.01 million previously); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, -0.4% previously); Durable goods orders, December final (-2.2% previously), Capital Goods orders nondefense, excluding air, December final (+0.3% previously) Earnings: Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), AMD (AMD), Amgen (AMGN), Apollo (APO), Chipotle (CMG), Electronic Arts (EA), Enphase (ENPH), Estée Lauder (EL), Ferrari (RACE), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL), PepsiCo (PEP), Pfizer (PFE), Snap (SNAP), Spotify (SPOT) Wednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ending Jan. 31 (-2% prior); ADP Private Payrolls, December (+153,000 expected, +111,000 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, January final (52.8 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, January final (52.4 prior); ISM services index, January final (54.5 expected, 54.1 prior) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Thursday Economic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January (+11.4% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 1 (207,000 previously) Earnings: Amazon (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Affirm (AFRM), e.lf.

PepsiCo chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta looks to jumpstart growth in 2025. The president himself said there might be some pain. He has delivered it. U.S. job openings fell in December, a sign that the labor market is cooling but still healthy. Openings fell to 7.6 million, from 8.2 million in November, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The number of layoffs fell, suggesting that Americans enjoy unusual job security. TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm KKR has sweetened its offer for Japan's Fuji Soft by 4%, the latest salvo in its protracted and messy bidding war with Bain Capital for the $4 billion IT firm. KKR raised its offer price to 9,850 yen ($63.44) per share from 9,451 yen per share, above Bain's most recent offer of 9,600 yen per share in December. Even after Fuji Soft's board rejected its bid, Bain perservered - a rare step in Japan - citing "strong concerns and distrust" over Fuji Soft's response and arguing the rejection harmed the interests of minority shareholders. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has gotten off to a bad start on the stock market in 2025, losing more than 10% of its value as of this writing, with Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's launch of a low-cost but capable AI model playing a key role in the semiconductor giant's troubles. Nvidia stock was one of the biggest victims of the sell-off, dropping 17% on Jan. 27 after it emerged that DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT's downloads on the Apple app store in the U.S. DeepSeek's low-cost model sparked concerns about major cloud computing companies and governments reducing their demand for the AI chips Nvidia sells. Prices of cocoa — a key ingredient in chocolate — have increased relentlessly over the past year, forcing companies such as Mondelez to hike prices of their products. Chicago-based Mondelez expects its 2025 profit to fall 10% on an adjusted basis, compared with analysts' average estimate of a 6.7% decline, according to data compiled by LSEG. Mondelez's volumes in Europe, its largest market by revenue, fell in the fourth quarter on account of incremental price hikes. INCY's fourth-quarter 2024 earnings are likely to have gained from higher Jakafi and Opzelura sales. Trump's plan might be "to acquire Bitcoin without the bureaucracy," Austin King tells TheStreet Crypto. Nike (NYSE: NKE) has been a top stock to own throughout its history. Under former CEO John Donahoe, the company took its eye off the ball. The company replaced Donahoe with Elliott Hill in September. Sign in to access your portfolio

TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm KKR has sweetened its offer for Japan's Fuji Soft by 4%, the latest salvo in its protracted and messy bidding war with Bain Capital for the $4 billion IT firm. KKR raised its offer price to 9,850 yen ($63.44) per share from 9,451 yen per share, above Bain's most recent offer of 9,600 yen per share in December. Even after Fuji Soft's board rejected its bid, Bain perservered - a rare step in Japan - citing "strong concerns and distrust" over Fuji Soft's response and arguing the rejection harmed the interests of minority shareholders. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has gotten off to a bad start on the stock market in 2025, losing more than 10% of its value as of this writing, with Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's launch of a low-cost but capable AI model playing a key role in the semiconductor giant's troubles. Nvidia stock was one of the biggest victims of the sell-off, dropping 17% on Jan. 27 after it emerged that DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT's downloads on the Apple app store in the U.S. DeepSeek's low-cost model sparked concerns about major cloud computing companies and governments reducing their demand for the AI chips Nvidia sells.

Given these dynamics and the volatility in the stock market, it could be difficult for investors to pick the right stocks for their portfolios. Tracking the recommendations of top analysts could be helpful in this regard, as they look beyond short-term noise and focus on companies' long-term growth potential. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start with streaming giant Netflix (NFLX). The company recently impressed investors with better-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter of 2024, reporting about 19 million subscriber additions. Reacting to the stellar Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and boosted the price target to $1,150 from $1,000, saying "NFLX enters the new year firing on all cylinders." Anmuth added that Netflix is gaining from a very solid content slate. While the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, the Christmas Day NFL games and the second season of "Squid Game" were major content releases in Q4, the analyst noted the company's commentary that these three together accounted for only a small percentage of the overall subscriber additions and that the robust additions were driven by broad content strength. The analyst also highlighted that Netflix is witnessing enhanced engagement per member household and encouraging retention. Reacting to the company's decision to raise prices, Anmuth expects only a little pushback in the U.S. and a few other markets, given the strong content. Looking ahead, the analyst believes that the story this year will shift more towards advertising, with the company gearing up to pursue several initiatives. Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix based on double-digit revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026, operating margin expansion, its dominant position in streaming, and expectations of a multi-year rise in free cash flow. He now expects 30 million net additions in 2025 compared to the previous estimate of 21 million. The analyst also increased his revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 4% and raised his operating profit estimate for both years by 13%. Anmuth ranks No. 80 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Netflix Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. This week's second stock pick is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery and the maker of the popular da Vinci surgical systems. The company ended 2024 on a strong note, with market-beating earnings. However, ISRG's gross margin guidance for 2025 fell short of expectations and indicated contraction compared to 2024. In reaction to the results, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus reaffirmed a buy rating on ISRG stock and increased the price target to $675 from $575. The analyst noted the company's upbeat profitability metrics and explained that the revenue beat was driven by solid gross system placements and procedure growth. In particular, Marcus noted the placement of 174 da Vinci 5 systems in Q4 2024, way ahead of JPMorgan's estimate of 125. "With strong momentum from dv5 heading into 2025 and a setup for another year of beat-and-raise quarters, we remain bullish on Intuitive and reiterate our Top Large Cap Pick," he said. Commenting on the 2025 outlook, Marcus stated that Intuitive Surgical's gross margin guidance of 67% to 68% slightly lagged JPMorgan's and the Street's estimate of about 68.5%. However, the analyst contended that while the gross margin guidance miss triggered some concerns, he sees the outlook as conservative, with a possible upside just as seen in 2024. He highlighted that ISRG's 2024 initial gross margin outlook was 67% to 68%, but it then ended the year favorably with a gross margin of nearly 69%. Overall, Marcus thinks that Intuitive Surgical is well positioned in the rapidly growing, underpenetrated soft-tissue robotics space. He expects the introduction of new systems and approval of the use of ISRG's systems in new procedures to drive future expansion. Marcus ranks No. 683 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. See Intuitive Surgical Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at the cloud communications platform Twilio (TWLO). Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan upgraded TWLO stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $185 from $77 following the company's analyst day event and ahead of the fourth-quarter results in February. "Following multiple years of growth compression and several strategic actions, we believe Twilio is now hitting an inflection point both in terms of narrative and fundamentals," said Rangan, explaining the reason behind his rating upgrade. Further, Rangan expects solid free cash flow generation, supported by Twilio's aggressive cost reduction and efficiency measures. Rangan added that TWLO's analyst day reinforced his optimistic view, thanks to accelerated product velocity and an improved go-to-market strategy. The analyst thinks that enhancements to the company's Communications portfolio can help Twilio expand its already dominant position in the core CPaaS (communications platform as a Service) market. He thinks that following robust Q3 results, there is still notable upside in TWLO stock, driven by the company's strategic actions over the past two years. Also, Rangan sees a possible upside to the calendar year 2025 revenue growth estimates, given inflecting usage trends in communications and new product cross-sell opportunities, backed by core platform enhancements and generative AI innovations. Rangan ranks No. 345 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Twilio Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Title: DeepSeek Undermines Robust Earnings And Economic Growth

Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek ... [+] development and President Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 130 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Four of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with another two coming this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek development and President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. The S&P 500 fell 1% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 lost 0.8%. Market Returns Though DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence large language model was released in December 2024, it rattled the technology sector when it became the most downloaded application on the Apple store last week. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. While DeepSeek almost certainly spent more than disclosed and may have utilized others’ intellectual property, their artificial intelligence model seems to provide competitive performance at a lower development cost using less electricity and less powerful semiconductor chips. Because DeepSeek is a Chinese company, its LLM is not likely to be used directly by U.S. companies. Still, it is open-source, so others here will undoubtedly use its innovations to build their models quickly. Before DeepSeek, the development of artificial intelligence was an arms race, with the thought that massive spending on infrastructure, electricity, data, and bleeding-edge semiconductor chips was needed to compete. Nvidia (NVDA) was the most direct beneficiary of this environment, as the company is dominant in providing the most advanced AI chips. The innovations from DeepSeek have opened a new path for lower-cost AI models. While these models are less powerful, they could be offered to customers in a low or no-cost model. This has shifted the balance of market power between the developers and suppliers to large language models, and the companies are utilizing those models internally or offering them to consumers to favor the latter more than previously thought. The most striking example of this shift is the decline in Nvidia (NVDA) last week, while Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) rose. All is not likely lost for companies like Nvidia, however. There should still be robust demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips because the most advanced AI applications will still require that computing power. In addition, the lower the price of artificial intelligence services, the more demand there will be over time. The shift is a reminder of capitalism's creative destruction, especially regarding new technology. DeepSeek - Tech Sector Impact According to FactSet data, the communication services and technology sectors contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Meta Platforms (META) was the most significant contributor to communication services, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) being the most critical contributors to the technology sector. On the other side of the ledger, earnings misses by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were the most significant detractors within industrials. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-nine percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for communication services and banks, the blended earnings performance improved last week and has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +13.2% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remain the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) reported last week, with all but Tesla besting consensus estimates. Market reaction was more mixed as Microsoft’s cloud earnings growth was disappointing, and the promise of Tesla robotaxis helped cushion the missed earnings. In addition, the DeepSeek introduction added to the difficulty in attributing this week’s price performance to earnings. This week, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) report after the close on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. The forward earnings guidance and implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other notable companies reporting are Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), PepsiCo (PEP), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Walt Disney (DIS), and Eli Lilly (LLY). Magnificent 7: Earnings Growth Last week, headline economic growth was reported at a below-consensus 2.3% in the fourth quarter, but the details painted a prettier picture of the economic situation. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending, exports, and any change in inventories, grew by 3.2%, which is evidence that spending by households and businesses remained robust in the quarter. GDP: U.S. Economic Growth As widely expected, the Federal Reserve did not change short-term interest rates. Due to good economic momentum and above-target inflation, the Fed is not expected to alter monetary policy until mid-year. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 0.25% reductions in 2025. The monthly jobs report on Friday will be closely watched as jobs are the canary in the coal mine for economic growth. Struggling economic growth outside the U.S. and the possible impacts of tariffs adds further uncertainty to any outlook. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The earnings from technology and communication services didn’t disappoint, but the story was upended by the DeepSeek news. Two more Magnificent 7 companies, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), report earnings this week, and their earnings and forward guidance will be crucial. DeepSeek shows that the end of the artificial intelligence story has not yet been written so that investors will monitor the situation closely. In addition to being the busiest week of the earnings season, the tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with Friday’s monthly jobs report, could add to the market volatility.

Title: 'Tyranny of high expectations': A veteran investment chief explains why he's quietly cutting exposure to US stocks, even though he's optimistic about the economy and AI

Many of the market's biggest fears may be overblown, though the head of global multi-asset at T. Rowe Price is starting to scale out of US stocks anyway. Investment chief Sébastien Page recently told Business Insider that he's not worried about economic growth, even though fourth-quarter GDP just came in lighter than expected. GDP still more than doubled consensus estimates in 2024, he noted. Corporate earnings, spending, and the unemployment rate also look healthy, and that's before tax cuts and deregulation. It's also too soon to say that China-based DeepSeek's highly effective chatbot will send artificial intelligence spending spiraling, Page said. After speaking with T. Rowe Price's tech analysts, the 25-year market veteran concluded there's no need to panic about DeepSeek. "The economy looks fine, earnings are looking to grow at 15%, and you still have a lot of AI spending that's actually going to increase maybe by 20%, based on our analyst estimates," Page said in an interview. However, Page also said US equities don't look as attractive after a massive multi-year rally. His main concern is the same as it was last fall: Markets are already pricing in plenty of good news. The S&P 500's forward earnings ratio is in the 95th to 98th percentile historically, he noted, but it pales in comparison to that of mega-cap growth stocks. This group's valuations are even more stretched now than they were in mid-November, following the postelection market surge. Even if all goes well with the economy, which Page sees as likely but far from certain, US stocks could fall short of lofty expectations if investors are underwhelmed by earnings. That's why as markets march ever-higher, Page said he's increasingly inclined to take money off the table. "We're still overweight stocks, but we're starting to reduce that overweight," Page said. "We're determining our risk-on positioning. I think as markets continue to rally, we'll continue to fade our overweight to go back to neutral-weight — not get out of stocks completely, just get back to neutral-weight. So that's how we're playing this right now." It's hard to poke a hole in fourth-quarter earnings results, at least so far. Profits have exceeded estimates and are up about 10% so far, according to Bank of America. Big-tech earnings were more of a mixed bag, as Meta pleased investors while Microsoft and Apple had some red flags. While some companies have issued timid forward guidance, the Street thinks earnings will rise at a mid-teen rate in 2025. If analysts are right, stocks could be in for another strong year. "The forecast for the next 12 months is that earnings are going to grow at 15% — that's a high bar," Page said. "So if you want to be an optimist, we can say, 'Look, we don't even need P/E expansion; we don't even need valuations to go higher. If just earnings come through, we can get double-digit stock returns.'" But companies have almost no room for error, Page said, considering where valuations are in the face of interest rates that are now expected to stay at restrictive levels for a longer time. So unless quarterly results meet or exceed an exceedingly high bar, US stocks could take a big hit. "I call it the 'tyranny of high expectations,'" Page said. "Meaning, the expectations for earnings growth are so high that you set yourself up for missing the mark." Cheaper value stocks are among the safest places to be in this expensive market, Page said. The market has fallen by 1% or more 17 times in the last 200 trading sessions, Page noted. In each of those instances, stocks with a value tilt have outperformed their growth-oriented peers, he said. That means value stocks are a better bet during selloffs, and have rebound potential. "Projecting forward 12 months, I would ascribe at least as much upside in value as in growth, given the valuation differential and the broadening fundamentals," Page said. "So to be overweight value I think is an interesting less-downside/same-upside kind of trade." However, that's not to say that the investment chief is bearish on growth stocks. The AI trade isn't over, Page said, as cheaper, better AI can actually cause its adoption rate to accelerate. "I would own both growth and value; tech and non-tech," Page said. "I think we're probably approaching peak concentration. So in our portfolios, we have a slight overweight to value stocks. We think growth stocks are still a very good long-term investment." With that said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials, and materials are strong bets because their valuations are reasonable, and the gap between their earnings growth and those of tech firms is narrowing. The same is true of healthcare stocks, he noted. Outside of the US, investors should stay selective. Page isn't overly bullish on international stocks but said less-heralded markets like Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are worth a look. In short, Page said his best advice for the next 11 months is the same as it usually is. "I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

The same is true of healthcare stocks, he noted. Outside of the US, investors should stay selective. Page isn't overly bullish on international stocks but said less-heralded markets like Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are worth a look. In short, Page said his best advice for the next 11 months is the same as it usually is. "I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

Title: Big Pharma has a big Super Bowl dilemma

Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game. This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.96%) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE-1.80%) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions. Considering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl. In addition to cost — a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects. EDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads’ big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate — a measurement of new cases of a disease over time. “The Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,” said Grover. “So, if you’re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.” Super Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN+3.51%) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should’ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999–2019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses. For drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. “The Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,” said Grover. “People are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.” Only two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year’s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast. Pfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company’s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired. “Because we’re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. — — like the actual second when it aired,” Grover explained. “And then we’re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.” For this year’s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game. The millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS-2.26%) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments — including an off-brand version of Wegovy. Novartis (NVS-2.23%) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings. “If you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,” said Grover.

Title: After DEI, the next frontier is ESG

DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

February 01, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Most Promising Dividend Stock According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks. During a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends. Dividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don’t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth. Also read: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in According to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan’s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future. The main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment. Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters. Investors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. In its Q4 2024, the company reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant 51% growth from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached an all-time high of $30.1 billion, with AI revenue soaring by 220% compared to the previous year, totaling $12.2 billion. This exceptional growth was driven by the company’s cutting-edge AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. For fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% year-over-year, hitting a record $31.9 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is drawing considerable attention from investors thanks to its pivotal role in powering products in various sectors, including data centers and smartphones. Its technology supports more than 99% of internet traffic, underscoring its leadership in networking. Furthermore, the company’s acquisition of VMware, a cloud virtualization firm, a year ago has bolstered its market position. VMware's operating margin has now reached 70%, and the company is on pace to surpass its goal of generating over $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) leveraged its robust cash reserves to boost its dividend. In the most recent quarter, the company generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and $5.48 billion in free cash flow, accounting for 39% of its total revenue. With 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, Broadcom is considered one of the most promising dividend stocks. The company's per-share dividend comes in at $0.59 every quarter for a dividend yield of 1.07%, as of January 30. Overall AVGO ranks 1st on our list of the most promising dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund with nearly $2 billion in assets under management — enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. Nvidia (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns Ycharts This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo — to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ — but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags Ycharts As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Title: Apple is no longer working on smart glasses to rival Meta
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apples-upcoming-ar-glasses-might-be-dead-water/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T14:30:57Z
Full Content:
It’s been a rumor for some time now that Apple had a pair of AR glasses in development, but a new report from Mark Gurman says the company has cancelled the project. Apple has expressed a lot of interest in the AR/VR space, but its first attempt with the Vision Pro didn’t make the splash the company expected. Its over-the-top price and more professionally-focused applications led to fewer sales and a lot of excess stock. The goal was to create a competitor to the Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, but Gurman says the cancellation comes in the wake of an attempt to change and improve the design of the glasses. The first version of the glasses would link with an iPhone, but its limited power meant applications were limited — and the demands of the device also had an impact on phone battery life. Apple pivoted and focused on linking the glasses with a Mac instead, but that was met with poor evaluations. The development team reportedly dealt with frequently-changing goals, adding to the difficulty, until the project was cancelled. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time Apple has shuttered a project. The company has entertained the idea of a self-driving car for a decade, but Apple gave that project the axe last year. Gurman says Apple also cancelled work on in-house LED displays for the Apple Watch, too. The loss of these projects doesn’t bode well for the future of the already-struggling Vision Pro. Gurman says Apple has a planned successor to the Vision Pro that would improve on the flaws in its original release, although there are employees who “believe there’s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team.” Apple hasn’t completely given up on AR glasses. Several unnamed executives “still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday,” according to the report. Meta doesn’t plan to release its AR smart glasses until 2027, so Apple still has some time to come up with another approach. It would be a welcome addition to the lineup, and a much more affordable way to access Vision Pro-like features. According to a report from The Information citing two Meta employees, Meta has canceled its plans for a premium mixed-reality headset. It seems the company told Reality Lab employees to halt work on the product this week after executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reviewed the project. It's uncertain whether the device was destined to be a sequel to the Meta Quest Pro or a completely new product, but it's clear that developing a competitor for the Apple Vision Pro was the purpose of the project. Posts on X are popping up reporting that Microsoft has signed a development and supply contract with Samsung Display for micro-OLED displays. The information originates from a Korean tech site, The Elec, which claims that Microsoft wants "hundreds of thousands" of these displays for an XR device designed for gaming and media consumption. In other words, a competitor for the Vision Pro -- or rather, another competitor for the Vision Pro. There's no doubt that the Vision Pro hasn't exactly been a bestseller. A new report from market analysts indicates that fewer than 500,000 Vision Pro headsets will be sold by the end of the year. However, the report also offers some good news for the future of the platform. According to Bloomberg, citing data from market analyst IDC, Apple is planning a cheaper version of the Vision Pro in 2025, and that could be the company's ticket to a much more popular device, predicting that it could double the sales of the Vision Pro next year.

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Leading with AI-Powered Cloud and Tranium Investments

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Ratings Investors Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. As AI continues to reshape industries, investors are closely watching how companies allocate capital during concerns over high valuations. According to some experts, despite market fluctuations, businesses are unlikely to cut AI investments significantly, as the technology’s long-term impact is still unfolding. The comparison to the dot-com era raises questions about sustainability, but many see AI as an innovation cycle that will drive broader economic growth. Marta Norton, chief investment strategist at Empower, believes companies are unlikely to significantly alter their AI-related spending despite concerns over high valuations, especially as DeepSeek raises questions about supply chains. She discussed this on Bloomberg Technology with Caroline Hyde and Mike Shepard, emphasizing that the market is still in an AI investment race and earnings reports will be key in determining future spending patterns. She noted that recent market reactions have been more about valuation concerns than doubts about AI itself. While Nvidia remains central to AI supply chains, the debate is now shifting to whether businesses need to keep spending at the current pace. Comparing the situation to the dot-com era, Norton acknowledged the risks of high valuations but pointed out that major technological shifts, like AI, can drive long-term economic expansion, similar to how the internet transformed industries. On the potential impact of cheaper AI solutions, she suggested that businesses, including retailers and software firms, could benefit from faster, more efficient deployments. However, she cautioned that these effects may take time to materialize rather than being immediately reflected in quarterly earnings. Addressing concerns about broader market disruption, she acknowledged vulnerabilities in major tech stocks but argued that the fundamental case for AI remains strong, with the primary uncertainty revolving around supply chains rather than AI adoption itself. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) incorporates AI across shopping, entertainment, and operations, fueling innovation through investments, AWS collaborations, and Tranium. On January 30, TipRanks reported that Bank of America’s Justin Post reaffirmed a Buy rating on Amazon with a $255 price target. The firm mentioned strong demand for AWS and its expected 19-20% year-over-year growth in Q4. He highlighted Amazon’s investments in infrastructure, including Trainium chips, as key to sustaining future growth. The company’s practice of billing primarily in USD also helps reduce foreign exchange risks, supporting its overall financial stability. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust.

Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Title: 5 key investing lessons from recent AI-market mania
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tech-stock-crash-deepseek-lessons-ai-concentration-nvidia-bonds-crypto-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-02-01T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
A new AI model from China rattled US markets this past week. DeepSeek represented a breakthrough for the AI industry, delivering results on par with OpenAI's best model while using significantly less computing power. The implications have been substantial. Nvidia stock shed nearly $600 billion in market value in a single day as investors worried about future demand for its GPU chips, which are the main fuel source for large language models. Suppose large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta adopt some of the techniques utilized by the open-sourced DeepSeek and become more efficient. Will they need as much computing power as initially thought? On the flip side, AI adopters, particularly software companies, surged on the prospect that the cost of AI technologies would decrease significantly, leading to higher profit margins. But there are even broader lessons investors can take from this week's black swan event, and they impact everything from bonds to stocks and even crypto. The concentration of a handful of mega-cap tech companies dominating the stock market has crept up to historic levels over the past few years. According to Goldman Sachs data, the top five stocks in the S&P 500 made up about 29% of the index as of December 31, and they're all highly exposed to similar technology trends. "Concentration in several large names is a concern when the drivers of success are the same for most of the names," Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, told Business Insider. Concentration is a double-edged sword. It can work great in bull markets, but a simple disruption to investors' overarching narrative could lead to a painful decline, as seen on Monday, when the index tracking mega-cap tech stocks plunged 3%, compared to a slight gain for the equal-weighted S&P 500. The concentration speaks to the idea that investors may not be as diversified as they believe. "This is an underappreciated consideration," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told BI. "It is common — and understandable — for investors to believe that they are adequately diversified when they buy an S&P 500-linked fund," Sosnick said, but that's not the case based on the extreme concentration levels. "Those seeking true diversification need to look beyond SPX," Sosnick said, adding that the Nasdaq is not the answer, with a handful of stocks making up about half of that index. Nvidia has dominated the AI story since ChatGPT was released in November 2022, as it turned into the key "picks and shovels" supplier to companies developing their own large language models. But Monday's price action revealed that there are second-derivative beneficiaries to the AI trade, which includes the adopters of AI technologies like software companies. If DeepSeek's claims of using less computing power are accurate, that means costs should come down considerably for AI adopters, pushing profit margins higher. Among the software winners amid Monday's bloodbath was Salesforce, which gained as much as 10% while the market swooned. "If DeepSeek has truly shown us that an open-source solution is far less resource-dependent than the ChatGPT paradigm, then the benefits of AI might be easier to reap from companies unwilling or unable to afford to partner up with one of the current firms that currently dominate the arena," Sosnick said. Crypto volatility was on full display this week, even though DeepSeek's appeared to mainly impact tech firms. Bitcoin dropped as much as 7%, in tandem with the sharp decline with the Nasdaq 100. The sell-off highlights that cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to moves in the broader tech space, and absent any crypto-specific catalysts, bitcoin is a high-octane bet on tech's continued outperformance of "Safe havens don't have an average daily volatility of 2%," Sosnick said. "Over the past 6 months, the correlation of the price levels of bitcoin and NDX is about 80%." Apple stock bucked the DeepSeek sell-off, rising about 8% in the week as investors determined that the company's decision not to spend tens of billions of dollars on building its own large language model was a good one. Instead, Apple is focused on leveraging ChatGPT's AI model and using edge computing to deliver quick answers to iPhone users. That edge computing is key, as it could become even more ubiquitous if AI models see a decline in their compute consumption thanks to the breakthroughs identified by DeepSeek. And a decline in compute consumption ultimately means a decline in costs, which could fuel even more stock buybacks and dividends for the company. "Cheap AI means a lot more capital to return to shareholders, either in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. Every US Big Tech company except Amazon already has both in place. Now they can get much, much bigger," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a note this week. If DeepSeek's open-source model delivers the expected cost savings to other large language models, it could ultimately mean higher efficiency and lower costs. According to tech CEOs, like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, cheap AI models should further accelerate the adoption of AI across various industries and lead to a surge in productivity. If that happens, economic growth could continue without sparking a rebound in inflation, which would put interest rates back on a downward trend. "If DeepSeek's processes show that the AI revolution can be achieved at a lower cost and with lower energy usage, that would be good for macro conditions (such as productivity and inflation) going forward," LPL chief strategist Jeff Buchbinder wrote this week. "In theory, this would help reduce the Fed's neutral rate a touch and keep interest rates lower than they otherwise would be if big AI spending continued unabated." Lower interest rates mean higher bond prices, sparking a potential rally in an asset class that was hurt by the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. "More egalitarian AI can and should boost productivity throughout the economy and thus have benefits for price levels and interest rates," Sosnick said, though he cautioned that such an outcome is "not going to happen immediately."

Title: Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Stock for Beginners With Little Money?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner-friendly stocks. Uncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration’s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump's trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows: "Everything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets" Recently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s, or Meta’s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build. The event raised a lot of concerns over America’s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China’s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek’s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple’s App Store demonstrates the country’s rapid gains in the sector. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $275. On January 24, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also got a Buy rating from Scotiabank’s Nat Schindler. Lisa Schreiber from Gradient Investments emphasized Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) being one of her top picks for 2025 as follows: “It’s the leader in online retail and is very well-diversified with its cloud-based business, where it’s also a leader. Additionally, its ad business is gaining momentum and doing very well. Together with the fact that the path to AI monetization seems clearer for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compared to other big names, we just have to recall their latest commentary around their cloud business, where they plan to introduce their own AI chip, which could potentially rival Nvidia down the road. The introduction of their AI agents is also increasing efficiency in their online retail. I think all of that presents great opportunities for 2025.” Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Mixture-Of-Experts AI Reasoning Models Suddenly Taking Center Stage Due To China’s DeepSeek Shock-And-Awe

Time Published: 2025-02-01T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Mixture-of-experts LLM structure becomes super-hot as a result of the DeepSeek AI release. In today’s column, I examine the sudden and dramatic surge of interest in a form of AI reasoning model known as a mixture-of-experts (MoE). This useful generative AI and large language model (LLM) approach has been around for quite a while and its formulation is relatively well-known. I will lay out for you the particulars so that you’ll have a solid notion of what mixture-of-experts is all about. The reason MoE suddenly garnered its moment in the spotlight is due to the release of DeepSeek’s model R1 which uses MoE extensively. In case you haven’t been plugged into the latest AI revelations, DeepSeek is a China-based AI company that has made available a ChatGPT-like LLM. They also made a bold claim that the AI was devised at a significantly reduced cost, causing quite a pronounced stir since the bulk of USA AI efforts assume that only vast and costly amounts of hardware could produce such a capable model. Hardware provider Nvidia took a big hit in their stock price and most of the major USA AI firms also saw their stocks get punished. If you are interested in whether we need to keep scaling up or whether maybe we need to work smarter when it comes to advancing AI, see my in-depth analysis at the link here. I will focus my discussion here on the overall nature of the mixture-of-experts approach, including how it has both key advantages and disadvantages. That being said, please know that the DeepSeek AI system is said to have also leaned heavily into the use of knowledge distillation, which I’ve covered extensively at the link here. The idea is that you can rapidly bring a new AI system up to speed by using an existing fully capable one to transfer or train the newbie lesser model. Some assert that if DeepSeek took that route, in a sense they were “cheating” in that they relied on someone else’s existing model to parlay their instance into existence (see my discussion about the ethical and legal intellectual property or IP rights issues that arise, at the link here). Another factor of their AI approach is that they extensively utilized reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which I’ve covered at the link here. The star of this show is mixture-of-experts or MoE. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). The mixture-of-experts approach traces its roots back to the early 1990s and I will toward the end of this discussion share with you some fascinating quotes from a now-classic AI research paper that got the ball rolling on this innovation in 1991. By and large, the core facets are still true today. The core is what I’m going to introduce to you. To get things underway, I am going to provide a simplified version of MoE. I say this to try and avoid getting harangued by trolls who will be distraught that I won’t be portraying the mathematical and computational complexities. Those nitty-gritty details are certainly valuable, and indeed, I will provide references throughout where you can readily learn more on the matter. Here’s the deal. The most common way to devise generative AI consists of designing the internal structure or architecture as one large monolith. Any prompt that a user enters will essentially be routed throughout this massive byzantine structure and have zillions of touchpoints as it progresses and is processed. This is easy to devise, somewhat easier to maintain, and generally works pretty well. An alternative approach is to decide that we will divide up the monolith into respective parts or components. Each component will have a specific purpose. The AI parlance is to say that these components are “experts” and that we are dividing up the processing into occurring across a multitude of these experts. I personally disfavor the use of the word “expert” to refer to the components since this tends to anthropomorphize the AI, as though it is a set of human experts. Each component is merely devoted to some area of interest, and I would say are specialized in what they can suitably process. Anyway, the word “expert” is catchy and has become the default terminology in use. The bottom line is that the mixture-of-experts approach consists of deciding beforehand that when you create a generative AI or LLM you will divide it up into some number of components that we’ll say are experts. Doing so has some exciting properties that can boost the AI in comparison to the run-of-the-mill monolithic route. Handiness Of A Bundle Of Experts The good news about mixture-of-experts is that you can hone the AI to be adept in specific areas or domains. For example, suppose I wanted to ask generative AI some questions about various U.S. presidents, in particular, let’s say Abraham Lincoln. A monolithic AI structure would take my prompt and feed my question about Honest Abe to the entire landscape of the AI system being utilized. Here and there, various bits and pieces about Lincoln might be touched upon. Eventually, it is hopefully brought together by the AI and presented to me as a cohesive answer to my question about Lincoln. In the case of MoE, we might have set up the LLM on the basis of “experts” that are components devoted to specific presidents. There is a component about Lincoln. A different component concentrates on George Washington. And so on. My prompt asking about Abraham Lincoln would get routed to the Honest Abe component. This component derives a response to my prompt. The response is then presented to me. Voila, easy-peasy. Note that a crucial element of the MoE is that the prompt by the user must be carefully parsed by the AI to suitably identify which expert ought to be activated. Suppose that I asked about Abraham Lincoln, but the AI sent my prompt to the component on George Washington. Sad face. Not where my prompt should have gone. Now then, in theory, the George Washington component would detect that the prompt is about Lincoln and then pass the request either back to the routing function or directly to the Lincoln component. You might say that the gateway or gating of the mixture-of-experts is a make-or-break activity. When a prompt comes in, the gateway had better do a decent job of figuring out which expert should get the request. If the wrong expert is selected, this could be a waste of time and effort. Worse, the wrong expert might try to generate an answer. Imagine my surprise if the AI responded with details about George Washington rather than Honest Abe. The gating has to be reliable; it has to be quick since otherwise time is unduly consumed, and it is also a kind of bottleneck. The positive aspect is that your prompt is likely to end up at the right place in the fastest time in comparison to the meandering monolith approach. The negative aspect is that your prompt might get misrouted and ultimately even produce a wrong or inappropriate response. Just another tradeoff in the harsh world we live in. Seems like you can never truly eat your cake and have the icing too. To showcase how this works, let’s assume that you are using generative AI to help diagnose what is wrong with your car. Your car has been making some oddball noises lately. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious basis for the noise. You log into a generative AI app that is made via a monolith-oriented architecture. The AI has various automotive mechanic capabilities spread around in the overall structure but there aren’t specific components devoted to say the engine, the transmission, etc. Here we go. As you can see, the AI is spreading your request across the landscape of the AI and merely generically seeking car mechanic portions. You decide to log out of the AI and instead log into a mixture-of-experts or MoE-based model. Here’s what happens. You can now see that the AI first used a gateway function that was labeled as a car diagnostician. This overall component decided that the specialized component or “expert” on engines would be the best place to route the request to. Sure enough, the engine expert said that the problem is with the engine. Let’s use the same example and this time the engine expert says that the engine isn’t the culprit making the oddball noise. You can see that the engine expert reported back to the gateway. The gateway then opted to make another guess and routed the request to the transmission expert. Luckily, this was the right final place to land in. Depending upon how the MoE is shaped, sometimes you won’t realize that the various so-called experts within the AI are being consulted. There isn’t necessarily a need for you to know what took place during the processing of your prompt. All you probably care about is that you get a solid answer to your prompt. Thus, another purpose of the gateway is often that it routes internally, collects what is being generated by the internal structure, and aggregates it into the final response that you ultimately see. Everything else is hidden from your view. Here’s what that might be like. In this instance, the gateway carried on an internal conversation with the various AI experts. Once a resolution was devised, the gateway aggregated the results and was ready to present the recommendation to the user. For an AI maker or developer, a big challenge when leaning into a mixture-of-experts approach is what the various experts or components will be focused on. You usually must decide this upfront. Once you’ve made that decision, the structure is somewhat locked into place. Suppose I opted to go with components focused on USA presidents. A user comes along and wants to ask about USA governors. Oops, my LLM wasn’t structured on that basis. At that juncture, it could be that I have set up only some experts and allowed a semi-monolith for the rest of the structure, and I will then route the prompt to that monolith portion. You could argue that this is not too bad since that’s what would have happened in a pure monolith structure, on the other hand, the experts aren’t being of much advantage if that happens quite a lot. Another notable design question is how many experts to have. Should I have experts per president, and then experts per vice president, or maybe just have experts that each cover a pair of a president and their associated vice president? This is a tough aspect to decide at the get-go. Generative AI is data trained by scanning the Internet and pattern-matching on human writing. The good news about MoE is that you can direct the scans toward the areas that pertain to the experts or components that you’ve decided upon. This can expedite data training. A downside is that you need to figure out whether the components or experts are getting sufficient data training. When you do things for a monolith, you at times just let the data training go as long as you can afford to do so or run out of data for training purposes. The MoE is usually best undertaken by assessing how deep and sufficient the components are during the initial data training. The upshot is that data training requires a different semblance of perspective depending upon whether you are data training an underlying monolith LLM or a MoE model. Lots more twists and turns come into the picture. Some advocate that MoE should have shared experts along with dedicated experts. This involves deciding that there will be specialized components that any of the other experts can use versus ones that are only to be used by say the gateway. The beauty of having multiple experts or components is that you can potentially leverage parallelization during the processing of a prompt. Envision that I wrote a prompt asking about both Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. In a conventional monolith, this is clunkily floated around to figure out which bits and bytes have something relevant to generate. With MoE, the gateway could split the prompt into two pieces, routing one piece to the Lincoln expert and the other piece to the George Washington expert, having both components working simultaneously on my prompt. Nice. Speed can be a great outcome of using MoE. A troubling aspect though can at times arise. The gateway might start to overuse some of the experts. Those particular experts become excessively relied upon. The AI gets sluggish. An important ongoing chore might be to monitor the spread of the usage and have some form of balancing algorithm to try and get things evened out if feasible. If you are intrigued by the MoE approach, you might enjoy the now-classic AI research paper that many attribute to having gotten this line of architecture underway (please know that prior papers also postulated and examined the topic). The paper is entitled “Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts” by Robert A. Jacobs, Michael I. Jordan, Steven J. Nowlan, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, Neural Computation, 1991, and made these salient points (excerpts): The emphasis is that generative AI and LLMs typically make use of artificial neural networks (ANN) as the underpinning of the AI, see my explanation about such neural networks at the link here. You can create a humongous artificial neural network as one massive monolith or divide it into subnetworks. Those subnetworks are the components or experts of the MoE structure. As mentioned earlier, doing so can make processing faster, which in AI parlance you say that the “inferencing” is sped up. Furthermore, again in AI parlance, the usual feed-forward network (FFN) layers are essentially replaced with MoE layers. Each MoE layer usually makes use of one or more experts and has at least one gating function. DeepSeek’s AI makes use of mixture-of-experts, as do several other high-profile LLMs such as Mixtral by Mistral, NLLB MoE by Meta, and others. No one can say for sure whether MoE is the best or optimum way to devise generative AI. I’ve noted that it has upsides and downsides. It isn’t a silver bullet. The shock and awe of DeekSeek’s AI will certainly cause a rapid and wider pursuit of mixture-of-experts. Some will rush to include it. Others will be dubious and argue that the downsides outweigh the pluses. All in all, we are in for exciting times. Let’s give the last word for now to Aristotle: “Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives -- choice, not chance, determines your destiny.” We will have to wait and see whether MoE is a choice, a chance, or a destiny.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from DeepSeek rocking the AI world to Garmin's major outage

Here's your firmware update for February 1, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week was wild. DeepSeek came and changed the AI landscape, but it seems like the full impact of its arrival is still yet to be fully understood. Meanwhile, Garmin accidentally bricked many of its devices globally thanks to an errant update, and Android XR broke cover in our first hands-on look at the software. Al that and more of the other big tech news stories you might have missed from the week are recapped below, so you can catch up with everything then get on with your day. Plus, if you're after a way to spend your downtime this weekend, then don't forget to check out our picks for the 7 new movies and TV shows to stream this weekend. It’s been a rollercoaster week for the AI industry, with the DeepSeek app rocketing to the top of the Apple App Store and beating ChatGPT. DeepSeek is a Chinese startup who claim to have developed their deep reasoning model, R1, for a fraction of the price that US AI companies have invested in their technologies. It also offers people access to it for free in its chatbot and at a much reduced price as an API compared to OpenAI. The news that a Chinese company can produce an equivalent technology for a fraction of the price caused a complete crash of the share value of US tech companies that are heavily invested in AI. Nvidia came off particularly badly, with $600 billion being wiped off their stock value in just one day. Share prices have since recovered, but it doesn’t feel like the AI market will ever be the same again. Questions are already being asked about how DeepSeek managed to produce its AI model so quickly, especially after OpenAI claimed it had evidence of distillation of some of its models. Distillation is a development technique where you piggyback off another model’s learning, but is against the OpenAI terms and conditions of use. To make matters worse for DeepSeek, it appears that when questioned about which AI model is best, DeepSeek will sometimes refer to itself as ChatGPT, which some users consider a smoking gun. OpenAI released a statement on the matter, saying: “We know that groups in the PRC are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced U.S. AI models. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. "We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here.” This one may rumble on for a while yet. A tough few months of software quirks boiled over into a massive Garmin outage this week that saw users in their thousands completely lose access to their devices. A rogue GPS file accidentally pushed to Garmin wearables saw watches and trackers plunged into a boot loop dubbed the 'Blue Triangle of Death.' Few customers found they could escape, and even those who did encountered further issues with connectivity and synchronisation. The outage lasted well over 24 hours and we heard from hundreds of customers – owners of devices such as the Forerunner and Epix ranges, as well as more niche devices including Garmin's dive computers, cycling computers, and Approach Golf Range. Garmin has since fixed the underlying issue, but there are reports that some customers remain stuck in boot loops and without a device. Plenty have even told us they regret their Garmin purchases or plan to depart for companies like Apple. It's a PR disaster that has overshadowed the launch of the Instinct 3, and Garmin has some recovery work to do if it wants to avoid a Sonos-style scenario. Nvidia’s new graphics cards are here and… and they’re already gone, with stock sold out across the internet in lightning-fast time. Some of these highly sought-after GPUs will have been bought by legitimate gamers looking to upgrade their rig – and they’re in for a treat, with our RTX 5090 review highlighting that it’s a seriously powerful upgrade that approaches complete overkill performance. Our RTX 5080 review, meanwhile, reports that it boasts some solid gains at a more modest (but still not inexpensive) price. Unfortunately some Nvidia cards also seem to have been picked up by scalpers taking advantage of the limited availability to flip them for a profit on resale sites by listing the GPUs for several times their MSRP. Resale sites have also been flooded with listings that seem to be selling the new GPUs for prices closer to what they should cost – but when you take a closer look, you’ll see they’re promising to send you a picture of the graphics card you desire, rather than the real thing. So, our advice is to wait for another official drop so you don’t get tricked by a scammer or pay three or four times more for the GPU you’re after – and you can follow our live Nvidia RTX 5090 stock updates and Nvidia RTX 5080 stock updates trackers for info on when and where these drops will happen. Nothing shared a short video of its CEO Carl Pei this week. Normally that wouldn’t be super newsworthy, but as the camera zooms in on his glasses we see the words “Launch 4 March” reflected in the lens. A previous Nothing Phone 3 teaser suggested this would be the announcement date for its next smartphone, but now it’s all-but certain. What’s more interesting is a cut in the middle of the clip that seems to shift from a shot from a wide lens, to one from a telephoto lens – the latter of which is absent from previous Nothing phones. We’re taking this as a hint that the Nothing Phone 3 could have a triple-lens camera – with a telephoto camera joining the wide and ultra-wide lens setup found on the Nothing Phone 2. Thanks to a hands-on video from Marques Brownlee on his YouTube channel, MKBHD, we got our first look at Android XR and the Project Moohan prototype this week. While many details including price, release, and some specs are still a mystery, we did get to see aspects of the headset’s design and software. It looks a lot like a combination of the Meta Quest Pro and Apple Vision Pro. There’s no over-the-head strap but instead a Meta Quest Pro-like adjustable strap round the back, and the Android XR headset borrows the Quest’s optional light blockers to change between a VR-optimized and MR-optimized design. It also uses an external battery pack like the Vision Pro to help save weight. As for software, Brownlee’s video predominantly focused on Gemini’s integration – which looks impressive. Though many of the AI features look like they’d be much better suited to a pair of AR glasses, so while we expect Moohan will be impressive, we’re already waiting to see what XR hardware Samsung and Google will launch next. Our favorite wall-crawling superhero is finally back! The latest adaptation of Peter Parker to enter the fray is in Marvel’s new animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. The show has a unique release schedule, though, as each week two episodes will be released instead of one – the first two of which debuted on Disney Plus this Wednesday (January 29). TechRadar’s senior entertainment reporter Tom Power has already seen all 10 episodes and says the show’s “a spectacularly fun ride” in his Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man review. Which is great news for Spidey fans, because two more seasons have been greenlit and the show’s creator already has “big ideas” for where it could go next.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Must-See AI News and Ratings You Might Have Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) stands against other must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. Northland Securities recently issued a rating for a stock amidst the DeepSeek AI frenzy. The firm noted that it isn’t concerned about the AI models just yet and that it doesn’t expect big tech giants to cut their capital expenditures when they report their earnings either. In light of this, the CEOs of tech giants such as Meta and Microsoft have recently defended their massive spending, noting how it was crucial to stay competitive in the new field. Investors panicked after news spread over the weekend about a Chinese startup DeepSeek having released AI models that were built using less power and chips. In response, executives of tech giants are saying that building huge computer networks has been crucial to serving growing corporate needs. Even then, investors have been losing their patience with the huge amounts of spending and a dearth of hefty payouts. READ NOW: These 29 AI Electricity and Infrastructure Stocks Are Crashing Due to DeepSeek News and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz DeepSeek has been causing a stir in the AI world and refuted the gap that previously existed between the AI capabilities in China and the US. After the first Chinese version of ChatGPT was released, there was a lot of disappointment in China considering it was not on par with ChatGPT. However, DeepSeek’s AI models have shifted the AI narrative completely. Not only has it sparked a frenzy in the US, but even its domestic competition has been pressurized. This was made evident when Alibaba released a rival to DeepSeek’s model on the Lunar New Year. According to the company, the “Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B”. Even though DeepSeek’s AI models have been impressive, there is still skepticism and confusion regarding the demand for high-end AI chips and the need for power to run AI-centric data centers. “There’s plenty of uncertainty over what the true demand for state-of-the-art chips, semiconductor fabrication plants and energy will be”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a circuit board with components depicting the intricate electronic componentry products the company produces. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) offers a range of product manufacturing and related supply chain services. On January 30, Barclays raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $139 from $91 and kept an “Overweight” rating. The rating has been issued following quarterly results. According to the firm, investors are valuing Celestica based on 2026 projected earnings, driven by the demand for specialized chips called ASICs which remain a medium-term trend. In particular, 2026 captures the run rate revenue of the TPUv6, Google’s latest generation AI accelerator. The firm further noted that Meta Platforms aims to launch a new ASIC program that could compete with the TPU program in terms of expertise and capability. Overall, CLS ranks 6th on our list of must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of CLS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

"Is DeepSeek an alternate universe that bodes terribly for Nvidia's pricing down the road? Hey, anything's possible," he said. "But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek." Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make — significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis, a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. "I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on," he said. "It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more." Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States, colloquially known as nearshoring, is poised to significantly reshape trucking and rail networks across North America. The push for localized supply chains promises shorter delivery times and reduced geopolitical risks, but it also brings challenges in infrastructure and logistics. The companies solving these challenges are going to be critically important and could be an investment opportunity. Nearshoring offers two big advantages and a few smaller challenges. First, it can help companies avoid tariffs and FX headaches. Second, it can shorten lead times and improve inventory management. Trump’s original push for tariffs and COVID-19’s supply chain shock have made a strong business case for bringing manufacturing back to the United States, but the cost of manufacturing domestically is higher than manufacturing abroad. However, having confidence that your supply chain can deliver and not having to deal with political spats carries significant value. Unfortunately, the higher costs associated with manufacturing domestically generally need to be passed on to the consumer. Higher prices for some goods are tolerable, but if it’s broad-based then it can be inflationary. An additional challenge is that the United States currently faces some constraints on manufacturing. Labor is one – we addressed it last month here – and transportation is another. Put simply, we need our domestic logistics to level up to accommodate a push for more manufacturing at home.

(Photo by Jose Castanares / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOSE CASTANARES/AFP via Getty Images) Mexico has become America’s largest trade partner, recently overtaking China as the top exporter to the United States. It is well positioned geographically and broadly has lower wage costs and a greater supply of labor for factory-level jobs than the United States. U.S. companies have invested significant capital in Mexico over the past several decades and many companies send parts back and forth from the U.S. to Mexico for different parts of the manufacturing process. Canada’s geographic proximity has also made them a critical trade partner for the U.S., but mainly in the realm of natural resources. Crude oil, liquefied natural gas, lumber, and other mined commodities consistently supply US markets. North American trade has become increasingly interwoven and has accelerated as scrutiny on China has mounted. According to the Brookings Institution, the U.S. imported $472.5 billion of goods and services from Mexico while Canada imported $15.6 billion worth of goods. The United States also accounts for over 40% of Mexico’s imports. This partnership is bidirectional and has led to gains for both the United States and Mexico. Generally speaking, Mexican manufacturing shouldn’t be seen as a direct competitor to American manufacturing but rather as a complement. Mexican factories use parts imported from the U.S. and vice versa; corporations have allocated capital across both countries to drive manufacturing efficiencies in an attempt to remain competitive with low-cost goods from China. While investing in Mexico means navigating complicated labor laws and exposure to cartel crime, the low-cost labor makes it a necessary input for effective North American manufacturing. The degree to which companies can nearshore and access cheap labor in Mexico is important because it impacts the mix of goods that can be effectively manufactured outside of China. High-value goods like electronics and automotive components can be manufactured and sold domestically with cheaper labor in Mexico and capitally intensive factories in the United States combining to offer a competitive product. Potential shifts in U.S. import policy, specifically with regards to tariffs on Mexico and Canada could jeopardize this balance. The ability to manufacture efficiently in the United States could actually take a hit if we make trade with Mexico and Canada more difficult. Consequently, while we are broadly optimistic on North American manufacturing, we’d shy away from trying to pick winners or losers who might be impacted by tariffs or trade disputes. Instead, we would suggest focusing on investment opportunities in companies who facilitate trade and transport unfinished components and final goods to their points of sale. The economy is strong and nearshoring has momentum, so the space is probably worth a look. 370225 03: Tractor-trailer rigs are parked at the Petro truck stop May 29, 2000in El Paso, TX. Many ... [+] of the rigs now have modern wireless communications as well as cable television, refrigerators, double bunk beds, and microwave ovens. In the last few years trucks have become more like a home/office on the road. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers) The value of U.S. freight by truck with Canada and Mexico has steadily increased since the mid-2000’s and amounts to over $70 billion as of December 2023, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. With nearshoring comes shorter supply chains, and an increase in the need for valuable truck space, meaning trucking fleets need to navigate the shifting trade landscape to accommodate retailers’ just-in-time inventory approach. With trucking, the two general approaches to shipments are full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) – the latter meaning a single truck carries shipments from multiple customers and the former meaning all goods in the container are destined for the same location for the same customer. Generally, LTL shipments are more expensive on a per-unit basis but offer manufacturers greater flexibility in getting finished goods to retail customers or storage warehouses. Instead of committing and paying up for larger shipments that take up entire truckloads, companies can have goods shipped with smaller, more frequent LTL runs which allow for quick inventory adjustments. These quicker adjustments are helpful during labor strikes or supply chain disruptions. LTL shipments account for just about 10-15% of the industry’s volume today, but the rise in e-commerce and necessary shorter transit times presents a compelling investment opportunity for trucking firms down the road. Companies like FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL), who specialize in LTL shipping, dominate the market and offer solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises that don’t have the scale to fill up whole truck beds with raw materials or finished products. Conversely, the FTL industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on brokerage firms to match shippers with small and mid-size carriers. According to RXO Inc (RXO), the top 15 FTL carriers combine for less than 10% of total market share. More than 95% of carriers operate 10 trucks or less! Although still critically important for the food, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries, it’s a heavily diluted market with minimal barriers to entry. Artificial intelligence and technological innovation are coming for the trucking industry. Something as simple as improving routing could lead to significant cost savings. Technology enabling the real-time tracking of vehicles, predictive maintenance, and dynamic route adjustments based on traffic or weather conditions could all lead to bottom line improvements. Better routes and more well-maintained trucks reduce fuel consumption, repairs, and idle/empty drive times. Firms with enough capital to own trucking fleets and invest in technology, like XPO Logistics (XPO), can also integrate trucking fleets with warehouse management systems to streamline order processing and reduce downtime. Technology can also help tackle regulatory complexity. Importing goods from Mexican maquiladoras, factories that import materials and export the finished goods, requires expertise in customs and border clearance. Facilitating the clearance of goods through U.S. customs and navigating documentation, duties, and inspections means third-party logistics firms like C.H. Robinson (CHRW) with integrated customs brokerage services are crucial for nearshoring to succeed. Finally, the United States is facing an acute shortage of truckers, especially those who are interested in long haul journeys. The adoption of automated driving for semi-trucks would be huge for the industry. Regional routes often involve repetitive patterns and well-defined paths, making them ideal candidates for early implementation of autonomous driving systems. These systems can handle highway driving and reduce driver fatigue, while allowing human operators to focus on more complex urban or last-mile navigation. Currently, according to the American Journal of Transportation, the U.S. has a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers, a deficit expected to double by 2030. This is compounded by the composition of the trucking labor force - the average age of truck drivers exceeds the median labor force age in the U.S. Companies focusing on autonomous driving are therefore going to be crucial if nearshoring momentum is going to keep picking up. Companies like Aurora Innovation (AUR) have teamed up with technology giants like Nvidia (NVDA) to mass produce its integrated driverless systems. Furthermore, companies like Tesla have been working on Semitruck technologies for years. LIVINGSTON, MONTANA – APRIL 5: Boeing 737Next generation fuselages manufactured by Spirt AeroSystems ...

(Photo by William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images) There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the logistics of nearshoring, and trucking is not the only solution. Intermodal transportation, the integration of tracking and rail, is set to grow substantially as trucking routes shrink and the just-in-time approach to inventory management continues to permeate American manufacturing. Intermodal transportation isn’t a novel idea, but the relationship between the two transportation methods will have to deepen to accommodate nearshoring and the current demographics of the trucking labor force. Intermodal transportation relies heavily on strategic partnerships between railroads and trucking companies to optimize the process of getting FTL shipments onto rail cars and shipped across North America. All of the big players in FTL trucking are attached to the hip with Class I railroads like BNSF Railway, Union Pacific (UP)and Norfolk Southern (NSC), so the ability to leverage scale and in-house logistics is of utmost importance. Rail hasn’t seen the same levels of growth as trucking over the last 20 years but is still well-suited for transporting large volumes of goods over long distances, making it a cost-effective option for long transports. Although the actual volume of rail freight is less than that of trucking, rail networks are essential to shortening trucking routes and reducing congestion on highways. Investments in rail infrastructure, including expanded rail yards, upgraded tracks, and digitization of intermodal facilities are all going to be essential in the years to come. However, investing in infrastructure is expensive and scale brings advantages in safety standards and cost efficiency. We wouldn’t be surprised to see M&A activity in the space pick up as nearshoring continues. Even if there’s no M&A, we still expect the space to have significant funding needs. Any build-out of intermodal transportation networks is going to be capital intensive. Electrification, new tracks, and new freight cars all have significant up front costs with long pay back periods. Specialized lenders and private credit shops will have opportunities to engage in asset-backed lending against those hard assets in the years ahead. Nearshoring is poised to uplift the significance of both rail and trucking industries. As manufacturing moves closer to home, the demand for efficient, localized logistics will only grow, requiring substantial innovation and capital. The integration of rail and trucking through intermodal transportation will be critical to maintaining the speed and flexibility needed for just-in-time delivery systems. Meanwhile, the trucking sector will see increased demand for less-than-truckload and third-party logistics as businesses continue to seek more agile, responsive supply chains. Technological advancements will also play a pivotal role in reducing operational costs for shippers. For investors, this evolving landscape presents opportunities in the picks and shovels needed for transporting goods from point A to point B. As nearshoring continues to gain momentum, the future of U.S. freight transportation will be defined by innovation, collaboration, and a renewed focus on North American trade, and is worth keeping a close eye on.
