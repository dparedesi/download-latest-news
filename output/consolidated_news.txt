Another billionaire has entered the rocket race. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has provided "substantial financial backing" and has become the CEO of rocket startup Relativity Space, its outgoing leader Tim Ellis said Monday. The company, which was the first to send 3D printed rockets into space, is building reusable flight hardware and has a long-term goal of building an industrial base on Mars. Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 until 2011 and was Alphabet's executive chairman until 2017, joins as the company aims to launch its Terran R launch vehicle in the next couple of years. The company said in a YouTube video posted Monday the vehicle is now in the design process. It launched its Terran 1 rocket in 2023, but it failed to reach orbit. Relativity Space declined to comment further when reached by Business Insider. "I know there's no one more tenacious or passionate to propel this dream forward," Ellis, also the cofounder of the company, said in an X post on Monday, adding that he'll transition to the company's board. Some of the company's eventual ambitions run parallel to those of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. Under Schmidt's leadership, Relativity Space's rockets could compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Blue Origin's New Glenn and New Shepherd rockets, as Relativity Space aims to create reusable rockets. The company, which was founded about a decade ago, is also known for using 3D printing to produce its rockets. In 2023, Relativity Space made history by sending the first rocket that was mostly 3D printed into space, though it did not reach orbit. The company has since expanded its focus beyond 3D printing and is also incorporating more traditional methods to produce its rockets. Relativity Space was valued at more than $4 billion in 2021, with investors that included BlackRock, Fidelity, and Mark Cuban. Jump to

Title: Panama Canal weighs pipeline to move gas, with eye on Asian clients

Business FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun//File Photo (C) By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY : The Panama Canal is exploring the construction of a pipeline to move liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the trade passage, canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez said on Monday, with Japan seen as a top potential client for gas coming from the U.S. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The canal, one of the world's busiest maritime trade passages, is looking to diversify its operations after getting the greenlight in a court ruling last year. A drought limited crossings and canal officials are planning to build a reservoir nearby. Japan is one of the world's largest LPG customers, using the fuel for domestic and industrial use. KEY QUOTE "We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger," Vasquez told Reuters following a press conference. "Meeting the needs for growing volumes (of gas) through Panama is of the highest priority, but also of the highest complexity," Vasquez said. CONTEXT The move comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Panama, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's claims about reclaiming the Panama Canal. Despite pushback from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino against Trump's claims, the U.S. leader and officials have hailed a recent deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its assets near the Panama Canal. BY THE NUMBERS Initial studies show that "possible traffic capacity through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd (of LPG) in a decade," Vasquez added. WHAT'S NEXT The canal expects to make a decision about the pipeline in the next 12 months, Vasquez said. Investments of $8 billion in infrastructure and sustainability projects are already earmarked for the canal, spread out over the next decade.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs.

Title: AI reveals which reading method is best

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice Here's the starting point for this article. For almost 100 years the Education Establishment has maneuvered, plotted, and schemed to eliminate phonics, and to make American children memorize sight-words. The pitch has always been sweeping: phonics can’t possibly work for a complex language like English, and sight-words are the only way to go. Teachers, students, and parents have been bullied relentlessly to embrace what phonics experts (such as Rudolf Flesch) assume is a fraud and a nonstarter. How does the ordinary citizen deal with this? Well, it's been rough because the professors at Harvard, etc. do not play games. They're trying, in my opinion, to dumb down the country in order to conquer it. They're not going to let you get in the way. In short, we have a perfect situation for testing what AI can do for us. A lot of people have the feeling that AI is like a Magic 8 Ball or Ouija board. Some profound truth is brought to us from the Great Beyond. Sorry, that's a false impression. AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Right. Phonics is essential but it works best on words with fairly simple spellings. It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?). Of course, when a person has true fluency of reading, it’s all by sight. 6 posted on 03/10/2025 5:10:26 PM PDT by Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Agreed. My brother explained the phonics principle to me. But most of my reading was based on whole word recognition. For years, I had a vocabulary of words the pronunciation of which was somewhat vague to me. So it’s not either phonics or whole word, it can be both. And individuals will find different strategies best for them. 7 posted on 03/10/2025 5:35:43 PM PDT by maro (MAGA!)

As as consequence, I went years without misspelling words in English. It was helpful later in Spanish, German, Welsh, Italian and Turkish. I've had a little more difficultly with Irish and Scot's Gaelic since I don't have all the "rules" committed to memory for phonics in those two languages. There are nuances in French to blend trailing consonants and leading vowels. Another body of knowledge to learn.Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. 14 posted on 03/10/2025 10:00:23 PM PDT by Myrddin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them.

My husband and I are homeschooling one of our grandchildren. He started with us the month he turned 12. He was completely illiterate and innumerate. He did not know the alphabet and couldn’t add 3+8. I started him on phonics. Three years and one month later, he is half-way through Saxon Math Algebra 1 and is fluently reading an Advanced Placement history book. Honestly, This has been the most important and satisfying work I have ever done.

In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?).

For years, I had a vocabulary of words the pronunciation of which was somewhat vague to me. So it’s not either phonics or whole word, it can be both. And individuals will find different strategies best for them. 7 posted on 03/10/2025 5:35:43 PM PDT by maro (MAGA!)

There are nuances in French to blend trailing consonants and leading vowels. Another body of knowledge to learn.Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. 14 posted on 03/10/2025 10:00:23 PM PDT by Myrddin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them.

These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better.

It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces.

It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words.

Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Too many contradictions and exceptions for phonics and word sight too limiting in vocabulary. There is no easy or “one size fits all” solution to teaching English as we know it. Sort of know it anyway. Pretty much why English is a required subject for 12 years of primary school. Yepper, phonics :) Right. Phonics is essential but it works best on words with fairly simple spellings. It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?). Of course, when a person has true fluency of reading, it’s all by sight. Agreed. My brother explained the phonics principle to me. But most of my reading was based on whole word recognition. For years, I had a vocabulary of words the pronunciation of which was somewhat vague to me. So it’s not either phonics or whole word, it can be both. And individuals will find different strategies best for them. Two computer history videos I made of computer applications for teaching kids to read. One for IBM Research, and one for BBN in Cambridge MA after I took early retirement and did videos for BBN and MIT Media Lab. A career change from computer language design that came out of being a Trekkie and making music videos. The world is just FILLED with fun things to do. IBM Research - Meadow - 1991 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t03p0B7dCrU BBN Voice Recognition Reading Aide - 1997 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQ5jcex5Ug Now AI is training humans to read the way it wants them to read. That is not all AI will be training us to do... My two years older sister taught me to read, she started when I was 3. My brother was born then, and I remember sitting in his high chair while Mom did dishes at age 5 reading Dickens to her. She took the book, A tale of two cities. Mom said, it’s too deep for you. I could read everything, and started out in 4th grade reading class at age 6. Both of my daughters were taught phonics at an early age, with site words added as they progressed to more complex sentences and words. Both are excellent and prolific readers. Look Say or whatever it is called this year is teaching reading as if English were Hieroglyphics. Literacy is obviously NOT the goal of modern education. “AI” will say whatever it thinks you want to hear. and if you disagree it will say, oh sorry did you want to hear this ? Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them. I highly recommend. Absolutely agree! My husband and I are homeschooling one of our grandchildren. He started with us the month he turned 12. He was completely illiterate and innumerate. He did not know the alphabet and couldn’t add 3+8. I started him on phonics. Three years and one month later, he is half-way through Saxon Math Algebra 1 and is fluently reading an Advanced Placement history book. Honestly, This has been the most important and satisfying work I have ever done. It’s not often a person gets to save a life. That is wonderful! Just one more thing. If we had more school choice, I believe privately run schools would use phonics, more children would learn to read, and government schools would be pressured to adopt phonic programs. Bless you. Truly, it is. He was sullen and discouraged. Today, he is confident, cheerful, curious,and eager to learn. He is a pleasure to teach.

Title: ‘Worst-Case Scenario’: Canada Trades Trudeau For Another … Trudeau

Mark Carney, the newly elected Canadian Liberal Party leader positioned to succeed Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister, may impose familiar far-left policies to the nation already burdened by inflation and regulation, some critics warn. Carney, ex-central banker of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England as well as the former UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, won his party’s support in a landslide victory Sunday. The new Liberal Party leader was recently appointed to head a Liberal task force on economic growth, with support from Trudeau, who resigned in January following years of economic trouble and a public dispute with President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Liberal Party Chooses Mark Carney As New Canadian PM As Trudeau Era Closes) “This is about a worst-case scenario for Canadians,” Marc Morano, the head of Climate Depot and author of “The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown” told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Morano cited concerns over how a Carney-led government would oppose the latest political and economic trends seen in Argentina, the United States and most recently, Germany, to instead “hammer consumers” and “double down on the green agenda.” “It’s as if he’s looked at the world the last five years and completely ignored reality,” Morano continued. Morano described Carney as “Justin Trudeau 2.0” and a “power player” that supports “corporate government collusion,” even comparing him to “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in terms of his power, expertise, connections and ability.” Canada’s Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre now faces a reinvigorated Liberal Party, though he’s led in the polls since October, according to CBC News. “Liberals are trying to trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor, Mark Carney,” Poilievre said on X in response to Carney’s victory. Carney is a staunch supporter of green energy policies and has vowed to “reward Canadians for making greener choices, such as purchasing an energy efficient appliance, electric vehicle, or improved home insulation,” though he also promises to cut the country’s carbon tax, which has been described as “very unpopular,” according to a campaign press release. The Liberal Party leader has a long record of supporting green energy policies, even if they conflict with the flow of the free market. “Achieving net zero emissions will require a whole economy transition – every company, every bank, every insurer and investor will have to adjust their business models,” Carney said at the COP26 UN climate talks in 2020. “This could turn an existential risk into the greatest commercial opportunity of our time,” he claimed. “Canada’s current climate policy has become too divisive,” a press release from Mark Carney’s campaign also reads. “We need a climate policy that is unifying, credible, and predictable—to reduce emissions, drive investment, and build an economy for the future.” During his victory speech in Ottawa, Carney also said that “Donald Trump is trying to weaken [Canada’s] economy. But there’s someone else who, if he succeeds, will weaken our economy. It’s Pierre Poilievre. … A lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.” “Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney continued. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.” Carney has spoken out against Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports, writing on X that they are “unjustified” on Thursday. The Trump administration argues that these tariffs are in response to the “flow of fentanyl” into the U.S. from Canada, further adding, “the situations at our Northern and Southern borders continue to require appropriate action from the Governments of Canada and Mexico.” Canada’s strong response to the unjustified US tariffs is having an impact. I am proud of the united front of workers, labour, businesses, federal and provincial governments that is helping Canada to navigate through this crisis. Today’s announcement is not enough. All tariffs… — Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney) March 6, 2025 “The world is absolutely going in the opposite direction from everything Carney stands for,” Morano said. He noted that Carney is “poised now to wreak this hellscape on Canadians,” potentially forwarding policies that will cause prices and restrictions to soar. “It’s easier to transition your gender than it is our energy supply,” Morano said. He asserted that clean energy power supply comes at a “higher cost, and it’s not green.” The author pointed to the fact that it takes 45 tons of non-renewable plastic to make one wind turbine. Morano also questioned green energy’s profitability, suggesting that if clean energy alternatives were profitable, green energy policies wouldn’t need to be mandated or subsidized. “Why do they have to ban the competition? … Why did you have to mandate them? Why did you have to subsidize them? Why are they the weakest points of energy output?” Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January after nine years in office and a sharp decline in approval ratings. Since 2015, Canada’s national debt has nearly doubled, Bloomberg reported, prompting citizens’ increased discontent with the state of the economy. Canadians cited the cost of living as their biggest concern that they wanted members of Parliament in the next session to focus on, according to an Ipsos poll taken in September.

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks slump as recession risks weigh on investors
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/03/11/roundup-us-stocks-slump-as-recession-risks-weigh-on-investors
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:22:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 11 Mar 2025 by Benny Xie NEW YORK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks plunged on Monday as investors grappled with mounting concerns over the health of U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 890.01 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.71. The S&P 500 dropped 155.63 points, or 2.69 percent, closing at 5,614.56, while the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 727.90 points, or 4.00 percent, to 17,468.33, its worst day since 2022. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, with technology and consumer discretionary suffering the steepest declines, falling 4.34 percent and 3.90 percent respectively. In contrast, utilities and energy managed to post modest gains of 1.04 percent and 0.95 percent. Investor unease was fueled by the recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who acknowledged the possibility of a rough economic patch ahead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Friday that the economy might experience a "detox period" as the new administration implements government spending cuts. During a Fox News interview aired on Sunday, Trump described the economic situation as a "period of transition" when asked about the potential for a recession. "What I have to do is build a strong country," Trump said. "You can't really watch the stock market." These remarks, coupled with escalating trade tensions -- highlighted by ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- have rattled market participants. The technology-heavy Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022, as major players like Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta each fell over 4 percent, with Tesla plunging 15.43 percent. Amid these developments, the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since December, reflecting a widespread move away from risk. "This is the first time we've had an administration pretty much say with a straight face... the objectives are going to cause pain," said Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. The S&P 500 has now erased all the gains it made since Election Day in early November last year. The Nasdaq has been hit even harder, as a rally in big tech stocks driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence reversed course. "There's just no support in the tech stocks right now," said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. Analysts are increasingly worried that the U.S. economy may face a prolonged period of sluggish growth. In a research note, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius revised his 2025 GDP forecast downward to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent while raising his projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3 percent -- up from prior estimates in the mid-2 percent range. These updated forecasts mark the first time in roughly two and a half years that U.S. GDP growth is expected to fall below consensus data, which currently anticipates above 2 percent growth. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Hatzius wrote. "Our near-term view is that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer," he added. Investors continued to seek safe-haven assets, driving demand for bonds and pushing the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down to 4.22 percent, as bond prices and yields move inversely. The simultaneous decline in stocks and interest rates is often viewed as a sign of growing economic uncertainty. Adding to the cautious sentiment, oil prices also dropped, reflecting broader concerns about the economy's outlook. Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson cautioned that U.S. stocks could decline another 5 percent as worries mount over the impact of tariffs on corporate earnings and the effects of reduced fiscal spending. The strategist warned the benchmark could sink 20 percent in the likelihood of a recession. "We are not there, but things can change quickly and so it's useful to know the downside in the bear case to manage one's risk," Wilson said. As market sentiment is fragile, investors continue to weigh Trump's mixed signals on tariffs and recession warnings against the backdrop of tightening trade policies and evolving monetary policy expectations. The coming weeks will be critical, with the February consumer price index scheduled for release on Wednesday and the producer price index set to follow on Thursday. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Bubble is Bursting
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/the-bubble-is-bursting/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:01:37Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMarch 10, 2025 In 2000, Sun Microsystems was one of the hottest stocks in the world. Sun seemed to have everything going for it. They were a leader in computer hardware, and offered cutting-edge software solutions. They were an integral part of the fast-growing internet ecosystem. Shares soared from $5 to $64 at the peak in 2000. The company’s market cap reached $200 billion, and the price/sales ratio reached 10x (price/sales is the ratio between a company’s market cap and its revenue – higher means more expensive). By 2002, Sun Microsystems shares had crashed 90%. That year CEO Scott McNealy penned a famous letter titled “Dear Mr. Shareholder”. In it, McNealy chastised investors for running Sun’s stock price up to such ridiculous levels. Specifically, he singled out the 10x price/sales number, and explained exactly what such a valuation implies: At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking? Eventually Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle for $9.40 per share. That’s down 85% from its 2000 high. As of the end of 2024, the S&P Information Technology index traded at a 9.9x price/sales ratio. Take a look at this chart: Source: Hussman Funds After the recent pullback, the index is probably trading at “only” 8x or 9x sales. The point remains the same. The market is wildly overvalued, especially tech. There are outliers like Palantir (PLTR), which trades at an eye-popping 69x price/sales ratio, even after its recent fall. That’s almost 7x higher than Sun Microsystems at its 2000 peak. Palantir is a solid company, but it’s one of the most overpriced stocks I’ve ever seen. In late January, Jim Rickards penned an article for us titled “A U.S. Recession is Coming”. In it, he laid out the case quite clearly. Markets are at or near all-time highs based on every available metric: P/E ratios, the CAPE ratio, market cap/GDP ratio, concentration risk, etc. This stock market bubble is amplified by indexing, investor complacency and analyst euphoria. When such conditions have existed in the past, they have always been followed by market crashes of 50% to 90% unfolding over several years. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (1929), the Nikkei (1989), NASDAQ (2000), and the S&P 500 Index (2008). We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or other unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. And now the bubble falters. As I write this at 11:00 am on Monday March 10th, the Nasdaq is down 3.6% on the day. If the bubble is popping, it’s still early in that process. As Jim noted above, major crashes involve 50-90% downturns. Right now the Nasdaq is only down about 14%. It could have a lot farther to fall. The hottest stocks typically fall the hardest. Think NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla. They are all fundamentally sound companies, but they trade at crazy prices. Just like Sun Microsystems in 2000, today’s tech valuations are utterly unsustainable. Bubbles can be fantastic money-making opportunities. But it looks like this one is drawing to a close. So if you’re still sitting on major tech gains (or losses), it might still be a good idea to take some off the table. Sure, there’s a chance that the market turns around and soars to new highs. But at this point, that looks highly unlikely. As I explained in The Pain Begins, it appears that Trump has decided to accept short-term market pain for long-term economic gains. We can’t look to Trump to save the market. He’s fully focused on saving the real economy. The market looks to be headed significantly lower. This week we’ll review strategies to navigate this new era.

Title: ROSEN, GLOBAL INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – NVO

March 10, 2025 17:37 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Eric Schmidt joins Relativity Space as CEO | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt’s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago. On Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that he made a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported. Schmidt is succeeding the startup’s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In a post on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company’s board. Schmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up for the 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R’s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported. Schmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google’s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins. Now, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company’s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches. Relativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan to launch the first private space mission to Mars by 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones. In 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R. The Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 and struggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity. While running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry — from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin — it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.

March 10, 2025 14:53 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against AppLovin Corporation. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 5, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery.

Title: Eli Lilly's first weight-loss pill could expand access to GLP-1s around the globe, executive says

Time Published: 2025-03-10T18:31:00Z
Full Content:
Eli Lilly (LLY-0.29%) believes its experimental weight-loss pill could make GLP-1 treatments more accessible worldwide. “We feel that a product like an oral, orforglipron, could serve a significant amount of patients globally,” Eli Lilly CFO Lucas Montarce said Monday at the Leerink (SIVB) 2025 Global Healthcare Conference. Montarce laid out several reasons why a pill could broaden access to the GLP-1 class of drugs, which was made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.00%) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.81%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. Montarce said their are many markets where patients prefer an oral option over an injection — like the current GLP-1s on the market. Pills are also cheaper and more simple to produce and distribute than injections, making them easier to scale globally. Additionally, government and insurance providers may be more likely to cover an oral medication over an injectable, potentially expanding access through public health systems. Orforglipron is currently in a phase 3 trial. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News in January that phase 3 trial results are expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory approval for the drug in 2026. At the time, Ricks said that a pill would be easier to manufacture en masse — and more simple for patients to consume — than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including Zepbound, Wegovy, and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is also working on a GLP-1 weight-loss pill. Last, year the company said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of its pill, amycretin, lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

March 10, 2025 14:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy - ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS' turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They've also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they've struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they "will be designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs." RELATED: Why your drug store is closing "By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we're continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage," a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has "done very little to defend revenue" of the front-end of its stores. "It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it's not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there's growing competition from chains like Walmart," he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself as a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. (The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)

CoinGlass data reveals that just over $535 million in long positions and $176 million in shorts have been wound up in the past day, with Bitcoin alone witnessing $304 million in liquidations. The total figure of $712 million represents an 85%% increase in the past 24 hours, with the dramatic uptick in liquidations resulting in a 4% decline in total open interest, to $87 billion. The cascade in liquidations means that Bitcoin is now down by 4% in the past 24 hours and by 11% in a week, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole suffering a 5.5% decline today. And for some analysts, the Bitcoin price descending to $80,000 today runs the risk of further liquidations in the coming days and potentially weeks. “Looking at the current liquidation heat maps, I think if the price were to drop to $80,000 or so on even weaker sentiment, this could trigger more liquidations of long positions, and in turn cause the price to fall further,” says eToro analyst Simon Peters, speaking to Decrypt. Peters also notes that, in the past, we have seen “retracements of 20-35%” in bull markets before a bottom is found and a recovery is set in mention. “$80,000 is a 28% drawdown or retracement from the $109,300 all-time high,” he explains. “If the price were to fall further due to the reasons mentioned above, a 35% drawdown from the all-time high would put the price at $70,000 before any base is potentially formed.” However, Peters also suggests that a recovery to the $84,000-$85,000 region could end up triggering a liquidation of shorts, thereby helping to accelerate a rebound. For some industry figures, one of the reasons why liquidations have been so severe today is that they’ve been driven by retail more than institutions. “Many of the recent liquidations likely stem from inexperienced traders who entered the market during the “extreme greed” phase in December 2024, driven by the so-called ‘Trump-pump,’” says Unity Wallet COO James Toledano, speaking to Decrypt. The declines that set off today’s liquidations likely followed from several fundamental reasons, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a recession amid a growing trade war with other economies. Investors have also been spooked by analysis which shows that the North Korean Bybit hackers have been able to successfully cash out $300 million of their $1.5 billion haul, with the converted funds unlikely to ever be traced or recovered. “Expectations were simply too high, and the market is now paying the price,” says Toledano. “One of the biggest letdowns has been the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which turned out to be nothing more than a repackaging of seized FBI assets—around 200,000 BTC ($16.5 billion), just 1% of Bitcoin’s market cap ($1.65T as of today)—placed under the control of the Federal Reserve.” The poor sentiment is reflected in one particular prediction market on Myriad Markets, which shows that 100% of participants believe that the Fear and Greed Index will not rise to 25% or above today. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) Yet for some observers, the crypto market isn’t sensitive to macroeconomics so much as it’s correlated to US markets, in particular tech stocks. “The biggest factor pushing prices down isn't the Bybit hack or the disappointing Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it's the steep fall in the Nasdaq stock market index, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks—Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla,” says Glen Goodman, a cryptocurrency analyst and author of The Crypto Trader. Goodman tells Decrypt that Bitcoin's price has generally shown a “very strong correlation” with tech sticks, and that whenever tech struggles “investors flee” from crypto. This view is supported by the fact that, according to Toledano, “Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for a fourth consecutive week, totaling $4.5 billion,” a sign that many of the institutions which have probably been invested in tech stocks have also been selling their crypto holdings. Toledano suggests that if sentiment remains fragile, leveraged positions will continue to be at risk, although a flushing out of over-leveraged traders could help prepare the ground for a rebound. “The key indicators to watch are derivatives positioning, spot demand, and institutional flows,” he says. “If risk appetite recovers, BTC could stabilize or even rally, but if fear continues to dominate, further downside is likely.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=134642&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: How To Create A More Agile Business For The Trump Era
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/03/10/how-to-create-a-more-agile-business-for-the-trump-era/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:22:11Z
Full Content:
ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff. It’s no secret that President Donald Trump’s economic policies have made uncertainty the theme of business in 2025 so far. His chaotic approach to tariffs—announcing them as coming, delayed and then imposed, sometimes with just days’ notice, has set most businesses on edge. Last month, financial health analytics company RapidRatings found that nearly seven in 10 supply chain professionals expect risks to escalate this year. Even before potential tariffs were looming, 81% of respondents said they had experienced supply chain disruptions in the last 24 months. Nearly a third of all of those disruptions cost more than $5 million, the survey found. A blog post from RapidRatings Executive Chair James Gellert brings the tariff threat into more acute focus. The post considers the possibility of a 25% tariff on China, Canada, Mexico and Germany, and finds it would significantly increase the risk faced by 25% of all public companies and 39% of all private companies. The whiplash of Trump-era tariff threats makes these impacts more significant. Companies and countries don’t know if announced tariffs will stand and effective dates will continue. Last week, a new round of tariffs took effect on Tuesday—25% on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on goods from China, adding up to 20%. On Wednesday, Trump decided to exempt Canadian and Mexican tariffs for U.S. automakers. On Thursday, Trump extended that monthlong pause on Canadian and Mexican tariffs to all goods covered by current trade agreements. But on Friday, he once again threatened tariffs on Canada—this time reciprocal tariffs on lumber and dairy products. This week promises more tariff headaches: 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports go into effect on Wednesday. Policies like this are wide-reaching and make planning difficult for companies. They’ve also sunk the stock market, with last week being the worst in six months. On a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump downplayed the market drop but didn’t deny the policies could result in a recession, saying that there will be “a period of transition,” and in the end it will end “great for us.” Figuring out what to do in the current situation is a huge challenge for businesses in many sectors. I talked to Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning company Coupa, about how to get a plan together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. People demonstrate during a protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite National Park. More jobs were cut in February than any other month since July 2020, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray& Christmas. Nationwide, there were roughly 172,000 job cuts last month. As far as February goes, last month’s cuts were the largest since 2009 during the midst of the Great Recession. More than a third of these cuts were in federal government positions, part of Elon Musk’s cost-slashing actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. These speedy and seemingly arbitrary and unfocused cuts have not just impacted federal government workers; CEOs of companies working with the federal government have started to talk about uncertainty caused by these cuts in their quarterly reports, the Washington Post reports. But the government isn’t the only sector seeing deep cuts. Retail is also seeing them, with the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showing 45,375 job cuts announced in the first two months of the year—an increase of 572% over the first two months of 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. According to Labor Department data released last week, the unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in February, though its timing doesn’t necessarily capture the full extent of government job cuts. However, the U.S. added just 151,000 non-farm jobs last month, the weakest February growth since 2019 and missing economists’ forecasts of 170,000 new jobs. A Target store in Novato, California. Target reported soft earnings last week, with declines in net sales, gross margins and earnings, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Compared with the same period last year, sales were down 3.1% and operating income dropped 21.3%. In its earnings report, Target warned of “meaningful year-over-year profit pressure” in the current quarter due to uncertainty—both among consumers and on tariffs. In an interview with CNBC last week, Target CEO Brian Cornell said that produce prices are likely to tick upwards within days of tariff enactment. As its sales and stock price are slipping, Cornell and his senior executive team hosted a meeting last week to discuss a comeback strategy for the retailer, Danziger reported. The retailer is striving to get back to its “Tarzhay” image—a term coined decades ago when it was perceived to be a store that made the everyday elevated and upscale. Target plans to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion in its stores, supply chain and technology over the next five years, with the planned outcome of $15 billion in sales growth. The company plans to invest more in its Good & Gather and Favorite Day private label brands, continue to grow its beauty section, reduce lead times for its home and apparel merchandise, expand partnerships with popular clothing and accessories brands, and enhance omnichannel shopping with AI recommendations and optimized search results. Aside from those investments, however, Target faces a distinct political challenge. In 2023, the retailer went all in on Pride Month-themed merchandise, a polarizing choice in some areas, which brought the store’s corporate reputation score down. Dialing back the merchandise assortment last year didn’t help matters much. As 2025 began and the Trump Administration began cracking down on diversity measures in the government, Target dialed down its diversity, equity and inclusion goals, sending its reputational score down again. The retailer was singled out as part of the February 28 People Union USA Economic Blackout—during which visits to physical stores were down 11% and app usage dropped 14%. A group of Black faith leaders is urging a 40-day boycott of the retailer to coincide with Lent. A New York City Walgreens store. Following years of store closings, falling stock prices and challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance is being taken private by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a roughly $10 billion, writes Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen. The company’s Walgreens and Boots stores will continue to operate, the companies said. Many of the company’s issues stemmed from its rollout of VillageMD clinics, a physician-staffed operator in which Walgreens had a controlling stake. A lack of patients for the clinics led to huge net losses. Japsen writes that VillageMD was the primary reason for losing over $8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The transaction is expected to close at the end of this year. Leagh Turner, Coupa CEO. President Donald Trump’s trade policies and announcements about tariffs have been wreaking havoc worldwide among leaders in both governments and businesses. Companies are working to make the best decisions for their bottom lines, investors and consumers in an environment where conditions are quickly changing. I spoke with Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning software platform Coupa, about how businesses can plan for tariff uncertainty, both now and in the future. Our conversation took place in early March when 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico—both now suspended for a month—first took effect. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What are new tariffs doing to companies? Turner: Companies are going to have to change. Are people ready for nationalism versus globalism? Are they ready for trade to be increasingly based on proximity? New trade partnerships? Goods flowing in different ways and are they ready to optimize for that? If the market’s going to win, companies need to try and find a way to deal with those things quickly and to optimize. How agile are companies? Are they thinking about these things? Do they have the technology to be able to do it? Are people in the right positions thinking about it? Is technology ready to be able to support this? The answer is: To varying degrees but by and large, yes. It’s going to feel like a belt-tightening and a process reinforcement period. And that’s OK, because let’s be honest, If you’re a large global financial institution, you should be spending within appropriate limits. You should have guardrails in place that allow for people to do those things right in the day-to-day. That’s just good practice. It’ll give them more working capital, more cash in hand. It will allow them to be a little bit more resilient to these tariffs or changing policies and allow them to think about what they do next. Once you get the basics, planning is super important. Who do or could I buy from? What would that do to the way that I flow goods into my company? What scenario of all the available scenarios is optional or optimal to me? What does it do to my P&L, and what choices do I make when those become constrained? We’re not done; we’ve put up trade barriers between all countries and the Americas. But there will be a global reverberation. It’s going to be this really interesting elastic effect for a long period of time that people need to insulate themselves from. You get the basics. You drive up your working capital and cash on hand. You do some really good scenario planning. Technology can help you do that. Here’s the awesome thing: The last time we had to go through anything of this order of magnitude, we didn’t have monster data stores and real access to clean data. AI is upon us and we should be leveraging it to help us make good decisions. How should companies be planning for short-term versus long-term? First, accept the reality: We’re just getting started. The second is: Go grab the low-hanging fruit. Pressure is an opportunity to get better. If a business has been operating with loose controls and has been allowing creativity to be deployed against uncreative things, then stop. We have this measure that we use in our business: the amount of spend that you have under management, meaning how much of your spending is controlled. One of the companies that I spoke to over the course of the last week has 3% of their global spending under control, which means that 97% of their spending is not controlled. It’s based on the person who’s doing the spending. In 2025, it precludes you from being agile and from being able to cope with the current circumstances. Once you face the truth that we’re just at the beginning, to get really disciplined. Technology companies have a massive responsibility right now to say that which can be known is known. Instead of bearing down, look up. Scenario plan, leverage the mass deployment of AI to be able to make decisions that you could never have made absent that technology, and create a business that is far more agile than it was prior. Let me say more optimistically that maybe this is just a correction. Maybe this is just an opportunity for everybody, like the great financial crisis, to get better for those who are really diligent and rigorous. And for the cream to rise to the top. At an investor conference last week, streaming giant Netflix announced it would increase its spending on original content in 2025. 11%: Year-over-year increase in content spending, which adds up to a planned $18 billion 301 million: Netflix subscribers, as of its most recent earnings report ‘We do expect the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown to slow’: MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a research note last week about Netflix, which led the company’s stock to drop more than 8% One of the most effective ways to improve your company is putting your employees at the center. And the best way to do that is simple: Prioritizing their well-being. Generative AI can bring positive results to your business in efficiency, creativity, employee satisfaction and consumer experience. But to make it work for you, you need to be able to scale it.

Title: Stock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’

The stock market selloff stretched into a new week, with the latest losses heagain tied to comments from President Donald Trump, whose wide-sweeping and oft-changing tariff policies have rattled Wall Street confidence, as early fears of a recession emerge. Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon’s comeback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September. Monday was be the Nasdaq’s worst daily decline since September 2022. Driving Monday’s pullback was Trump’s interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic “transition” and cautioned “you can’t really watch the stock market.” Trump’s comments are “weighing on sentiment” and “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients. Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week. Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety. 20%. That’s about how much the “magnificent seven” group of big American tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg. The recent decline coincided with Trump’s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump’s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. “The reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,” explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies. Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday’s roughly 5,610. Trump’s policies will be “sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before” lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies “benefit the market later in the year,” said Wilson. “This is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in emailed comments. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What is Alphabet Inc.?
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Alphabet-Inc
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:07:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Incorporated (also known as Alphabet Inc. or simply Alphabet) is a conglomerate of numerous companies, including the search engine giant Google. In 2015, Alphabet became Google's holding company. As of 2025, Google, along with many other companies like Fitbit, Waymo and Mandiant, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Alphabet Inc. on Oct. 2, 2015. They announced their intentions to create a new holding company in August 2015. Alphabet was the result of its wish to strategically restructure the original company to make it cleaner, leaner, and more accountable to its investors and customers. With this change, Alphabet replaced Google Inc. as a publicly traded entity. Alphabet also became the parent company for many other businesses that originally fell under the Google Inc. umbrella and for other companies acquired after the 2015 split. The company is incorporated in Delaware; its headquarters are at Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. According to Larry Page's open letter on the Alphabet Investor Relations page, it says he and Brin chose the name "Alphabet" because the word means "a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search." Page also said they favored the name because it breaks down into alpha-bet. In a financial context, alpha means investment return above benchmark, which is what the company has always strived for, according to Page. As part of the transition from Google Inc. to Alphabet, all Google shares were transferred to Alphabet stock on a share-for-share basis, with the former automatically converting into the same number of shares of the latter, with all the same rights. Alphabet trades on the Nasdaq composite under Google's former ticker symbols, GOOG and GOOGL. These symbols represent two types of shares. GOOGL shares are Class A shares or common stock. These shares confer ownership stake and voting rights on stockholders. GOOG shares are Class C shares that confer no voting rights on holders. By issuing Class C shares, Brin and Page were able to preserve their control while also positioning the firm to take advantage of liquidity in the public market. During a five-year period between December 2018 and December 2023, Alphabet's net income increased by 23% and its revenue by 18.%. Its gross margin also increased by 61%, and cash flow rose 25%. Between March 2024 and January 2025, the share price fluctuated between $131 and $206. Toward the end of January 2025, GOOG shares were trading on Nasdaq composite at over $200. Alphabet offers a broad range of digital products and services. Its most famous product is the Google search engine, which was launched in 1999 and occupies the largest market share as of January 2025. Some other popular products from Alphabet under the Google umbrella include the following: Besides these consumer products, Google's product suite also includes products for business use: Other well-known Google products include Google Cloud, a cloud computing platform that allows users to access numerous services over the cloud, and the Google Workspace suite of cloud-based productivity apps. In recent years, Google has scaled up efforts to develop its AI capabilities and product suite. This has yielded products such as the following: Alphabet's offerings also span products and services such as the following: These products are independently developed and marketed by Alphabet's many other (non-Google) subsidiaries. Between 2015 and 2025, Alphabet acquired more than 150 companies, many of which occurred after the first few years of its inception. Notable acquisitions for Alphabet include the following: The wide range of acquisitions highlights Alphabet's willingness to look beyond its Google search roots and, as Page said in his investor letter of 2015, to contain "the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products" within Alphabet. Despite Alphabet's expansion, Google remains one of its largest subsidiaries. In addition to the original search engine and digital advertising businesses, Google maintains control over many of its other profitable legacy businesses for Alphabet, including YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail and Google Cloud. Other offshoots of the former company including GV (formerly Google Ventures); CapitalG (formerly Google Capital); X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X); and Google Nest (formerly Nest Labs) are also Alphabet subsidiaries. These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

Do you wanna do full range? -Just the elbow motion. -Do you wanna squeeze at the top? -Amplitude… -Eh, you know… If we could do this, like, outside my apartment 5 minutes away at a cafe – sure! Do I swing my sword around like this? Or do I do like… -What are the first 3 supplements that you would recommend the average intermediate trainee to look at. Or formulated otherwise, what are the 3 supplements that you recommend the most often? -Man, that’s tough because I’m now sponsored by a new company that has “the ultimate 6 supplements”. They explicitly told me never ever mention 1 without mentioning the other 5. So I’m actually contractually obligated not to answer this question. Is there another question I can answer? -Right. Go with creatine then. -So this is just creatine 123. Yeah. So I think it depends on how we talk about supplements, because I typically don’t talk about multivitamins as a supplement, even though it is. It’s not something they considered like for health and fitness. And I think it’s like way more for health than it is for fitness. It’s not going to get you more jacked. But I think that if you’re serious enough to be taking supplements, I think that you should consider multivitamin, multimineral in any of the many, many ways that you can take such a thing, including some of the better kind of greens, powders type situations. I think sometimes they have some merit to more or less just round out your intake of micronutrients to make sure that, like, you’re not just missing like entire swathes of, you know, the D vitamins or something, which can make a difference. And so I would say like some, you know, counter consideration can be made for multivitamin multimineral. Though the, the literature on that is not super clear. And there are lots of caveats and contextual things. Creatine is hugely in consideration at the top three. It’s probably one of the most empirically well-supported supplements. It’s empirically supported and also supported in a few different ways that are worth mentioning. One way it’s supported is, it’s just direct scientific investigations show that it almost always works to gain muscle and strength. It’s also, very, very importantly, well understood in the, in the trenches, so to speak, in the fitness world, to be like something that actually works. You know, there’s a few things that have a good empirical support, but the effect magnitude is so small that nobody really uses it. And people who tried it, they’re like, I don’t know if it does anything. Creatine does stuff, which is sweet. It’s also the physiological rationale, the chemical rationale makes perfect sense. And, all those aligning is a pretty damn good. And also creatine is like a few interesting potential cognitive benefits and health benefits, which is at some point creating kind of seems like essential almost to take if you want to optimize and so creatine is good. And, you know, slot number 3 would be kind of a mix and match of what sorts of challenges are you running into in your life? If you are in a situation where you find the literature on intro workout, post-workout nutrition compelling, and worth your time, and then you have everything else sorted in your nutrition, I would say getting a high quality whey or whey like protein with a rapidly digesting carbohydrate, like Powerade or Gatorade powder or something, consuming that during and after your workout might be something that makes it things go better, especially if you’re workouts are very hard or very long. And if you can throw some electrolytes in there, then, if your workouts have you sweating a lot and stuff, then that can really quite, make a decent impact. Very marginal effect in total, but it’s one of those things, like… it makes such good theoretical sense and experientially so many people who have tried it they’re like: “The last half an hour of my workout just goes way better if I do this.” then great. It also sets you up for if you finish your whey protein, your carbs after training, you have time to shower, you have time to drive without needing to be paranoid about instantly, you know, guzzling down as much protein as possible. So that can be quite nice and convenient. It’s also very, has a very good price performance. A lot of people will illusorily say, I’m sure you get this all the time, like, I can’t afford supplements. Like you understand, whey protein is cheaper than meat in almost every context. So… and higher quality. So… it’s just very, very difficult to say it’s bad. But if you’re a person who struggles to get daily protein in, up to high enough levels, then I would say yes, whey protein is a consideration for supplementation, but also so is casein protein. And so it’s like egg protein. And a variety of vegan proteins can do a great job like soy protein if you are a vegan. And so just any kind of protein supplement to get you up to your daily standard of multiple meals throughout the day, roughly even protein, I think, is a really excellent thing. Is it technically a supplement? Oh, yeah, we can argue all day. It’s really kind of just a food. But I think so. Basically. If you’re not taking some kind of multivitamin-multimineral, if your diet is a very well rounded, you don’t have to and then you’re totally good. If you’re not taking creatine and if you’re not taking some kind of protein on an as needed basis, then, I would say though, those are probably the first supplements to look at. A couple of… can I talk about some ones that didn’t make the list? -Sure. Yeah. -Yeah, like… So, you know, if you need energy and focus and stuff, I think caffeine based stimulant product pre-workout can have an utility function that’s positive for you. Not everyone needs that sort of thing. I don’t. A lot of people think, like, you know, they train at 6 p.m., and so, like, it’s just intractable because they would just never fall asleep or the sleep quality sucks, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. And there are, you know, a few other supplements that have kind of sort of contextual situation. Sometimes literature on omega 3 looks pretty good, sometimes it doesn’t look so good. Generally it’s fine, so maybe that’s something to consider, a healthy fat supplement. But, you know, I think those are probably in the conversation for me for things to consider. And the last thing I’ll say is, you know, outside of creatine just probably being better to take than not to take and making sure that, you know, your vitamin mineral levels are good. And if not, feel free to supplement. There are ways to just never have to eat supplements and get all the protein you need. And after that all of the supplements that you could take that really make a difference, at least today, don’t have a lot of convincing evidence that you even need to take them. And so it’s kind of, a thing where I think a lot of people get to the intermediate stage and think, okay, like time for supplements. And they open the door metaphorically to supplements, and that room is like, like one dustbin falls over and a spider crawls across the floor… The fuck? It’s nothing in here, really. Creatine is in there by itself. Like “I thought you’d never come rescue me.” And so, you know, like, it’s just, supplements just aren’t that big of a deal to begin with. So I just want to make sure people get that information. Because I think a lot of people, you tell them, like “When you’re in intermediate, man, get creatine, and protein will jack you up…” and then… is just not true that these make such a huge effect that you even need to be taking them. -Yeah, it’s one of the things where people micromanage the most about the things that actually matter the least… probably. And I would agree that most of the supplements that I recommend to clients or people, there are things that you could get from your diet, but people don’t, whether that’s magnesium or vitamin D, vitamin D you can also get from the sun not so much diet in the first place. And then there’s creatine, basically… Do you put any stock in anything beyond creatine or that you wouldn’t get from your diet like citrulline, beta-alanine? -So beta-alanine is a fun supplement. I don’t like how it makes my skin feel. It’s not. A lot of people think that feels nice. I hate it. -The tingling… -Yes. Is it just not convincing to me that it causes muscle growth and since muscle growth is kind of the only thing I optimize on, if I was interested in sport performance maximally, I would probably have phases of beta-alanine administration because it is quite a decent buffer and it can let you get a few more reps or a few more steps or a few more rolls. -Not for jiu jitsu? -So, I don’t optimize for jiu jitsu. If I was, I’d may very well take it. And, so that’s a fun supplement, Citrulline malate, it does some things, but, it just hasn’t stood the test of time in a way that we can say, like, this is for sure the things it does, and they’re really good and they’re really meaningful. I wanted, you know, in the 2010 citrulline was something that everyone was looking at very closely at, and it just kind of was like, you know, like it’s like your friend goes on a couple dates with a guy and she’s like “I think he’s great.” And a couple weeks later, like, “How’s Frank?” She’s like “.%##&% Frank…”, you know… And you’re like: “Oh shit, you know, it’s just some guy.” So citrulline, it just doesn’t seem to have that kind of real raw, like, wow effect magnitude that makes it malleable for me. -Yeah. What you very often seen with supplements and especially with citrulline is that people get very excited about a proxy for the results that they’re looking for. So citrulline makes you do more reps and then they’re like, more gains. But actually there’s no study finding statistically significantly greater muscle growth with citrulline supplementation than without it. Now, the supplements… the research is a little bit limited, but with supplements I think the bar can be pretty high because there’s so much stuff that goes on. So many publication bias, false positives… So if there’s not very compelling research showing it actually does improve the outcome that you’re looking for, like muscle growth, I think it’s indeed very fair to say you can have a very skeptical outlook towards that something. -Yeah. And it doesn’t mean a cynical outlook because you can say… look like, five studies later, we might all be taking citrulline malate. Five very good studies, replicated by different labs… But for now, there’s no doubt, I think like, from a kind of grander perspective on truth value, there are probably at least a few supplements currently in use and sold somewhere in small health food stores that are actually bangers, like they fuck and they work. We just don’t have the research volume to say for sure. And because humans have limited money, and the number of supplements you can buy is actually so… kind of unlimited. Like there are hundreds of them. And they each cost $20-$60 per month. Man. You know, you just don’t want to take them all. If you’re Brian Johnson, then you’re, you know, trillionaire or whatever, you can take all of them. But he’s really systematic, too, about taking a lot of supplements for a long time, trying to figure out which ones work, which ones don’t. And then he, like, puts a bunch of them away after another. Yep. That didn’t work. That didn’t work. If you want to do something like that, that’s cool. The ROI on that for him is awesome, for you and me and everyone else is going to be a gigantic fucking waste of time. Better he does it and we find out what works by him. But yeah, no doubt there there are supplements because what I don’t want people to get the perception of. And I used to commit this fallacy all the time is the like “Keep it simple stupid” fallacy. You know, can you imagine, like, telling someone who works at a video who designed a GPU cores to keep it simple? He’s like, get out of my face. You have no idea how complicated this is. The human body is quite complex, and there are no doubt supplements out there that absolutely work, we just don’t know about in a real confirmatory way. And so in the future, we have to be open minded that some supplements really do work, because a lot of people get this idea when we speak that, oh, just like 2 or 3 things that work, everything else doesn’t work. It’s like, no, that doesn’t work. It’s some of them don’t work because we’ve studied like, you know, ten times and it just comes up zero every time – probably doesn’t work. But a lot of them were just like, I’m just… I’m just not sure if they work, you know. And so because they cost money, you know… A very terrible analogy I always give is like, would you drive three hours one way and three hours back to, like, hook up with a hook up buddy who, like, just does it every time, like, she’s got it like, yeah, maybe. Right? But if it was like, hey, would you drive three hours for someone that may or may not even show up to the date? You’re like, man, three hours, bro… You know, if you could do this, like outside my apartment five minutes away at a cafe, sure. But like three hours, no. That cost, you know, if someone was willing to ship you free supplements every month and try new supplements all the time, I’d say yes. Try them all. You know, not gonna kill you. But because they cost money and because you put your hopes and dreams into them working I would say for the most part, stick to the ones that probably work. -Speaking of things that actually work, what do you think… What do you think the things are that really move the needle the most for an intermediate level trainee? So they’re doing the basics. You know, they’re doing strength training. They are consuming enough protein. They’re tracking the macros. They have a at least some decent volume of training and decent effort. They got their newbie gains and then they get kind of stuck. What do you think are the things that, for those types of individuals, have the most effect, things they could do, like invest more time in to get better gains? -One is… …so the intermediates, right? They’re early intermediates or late intermediates? -Let’s say early intermediates. -So it’s a… try to analyze whether or not you are pushing yourself hard in the gym on an objective standard. -How do you know that? -So you set yourself a goal of getting roughly 3 RIR in the first week of your mesocycle, and you write down all your sets and reps, and then every single week after until you have to deload you make it your fucking mission as a grown adult to match or exceed every single… exceed every time. So if it’s the same weight, one more rep every set, if it’s, a little bit more weight, same reps. Don’t let your reps fall until you hit failure, and not failure like you gave up. Failure like somebody is there to make sure you don’t die and really learn what that feels like. You may just be training either exactly as hard as you thought and you’re like, okay, that’s not a limiting factor. Great. I can move on to the next thing, or you will be like, oh yeah, I can try harder because a lot of people will do independent RIR estimates, which are totally cool way to train. And that means like every time you come to the gym, whatever you’re RIR is, it doesn’t matter if it’s failure or if it’s 2 RIR, they’ll just sort of organically get to it and every time, independently of what happened last session, independently of the next session. And that’s cool. And if you have, a really hard training drive, it’s an excellent way to train. It’s also very liberating. You just fucking send it, you know, you don’t have to worry about numbers, or anything like that. But if you suspect you might not be training hard enough, which I find that a lot of folks who are intermediates can train harder, than the easiest way to do it, in my opinion, the most straightforward and more systematic is to set yourself a nice, easy goal in the first week and just keep beating it by a little. And at some point it’s going get really tough, and then you’re going to find out how tough is it, because some people will say, oh man, I got ten reps and I couldn’t have gotten 11. But if last week you got 11 and this week it’s just 2.5 more pounds on the bar, you need to get 11, then… …seeing it from that mentality, you might get 11. And then next week you get 11 again. And the week after you’re like, there’s no way I’m going to do it. But you believe in yourself and you get 11 again. Then you find out what really hard training is, and then you find out if it was limiting you or not. Because sometimes hard training like is roughly the same and sometimes hard training is a big, big unlock. So I’d say that’s something worth exploring. Once you’ve done that… So… -Progressive overload, very important. -Yes, yes. -Reps in reserve and testing that you’re actually getting to that desired level of proximity to failure by occasionally going to failure. -Yes. But not, not just going to failure. Trying to meet an objective standard you don’t know if you can meet, but really putting your ego behind it, because what you may think is your failure point is your failure point, but it’s much more psychological and physiological. But if you unlock your psychology to say, I don’t give a fuck what happens, I’m going to go all the way and let’s see if I can get 11 reps and maybe you’ll get 9, And you look like: I really did try absolutely as hard as I could, but whatever. If you think you’re really, really, really, really trying and you’re not making the gains you want, that’s probably not where you’re going to get more, more gains. But if you’ve never objectively put up a standard… Why am I saying this? Personal trainer for a long time, coaching people for a long time, coaching myself for a long time… You’d be really, really surprised in many cases when you put an objective standard to someone’s performance week after week how much their performance elevates, because usually, you know, especially when you’re highly fatigued after a few weeks, you need like, what do you call them? Reactive deload. Your biceps are kind of cooked. You’re like, I deload time. But really, like, you really were three RIR and you know, your girlfriend kind of was bitching at you that week, school kind of got hard, your psychology drained a little bit and you’re like…. And it’s like, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. And I go, well, how many reps were you trying to get? And they’re like, well, I wasn’t trying to get the number of reps, I was just trying to go to failure. Like your mind can trick you, man. Your mind can fucking trick you and can say, oh, this is failure. Like, no, no, no, no, no. Like we don’t have a marathon race or 500 or a 100 meter or a 200 meter race that race isn’t just go really fast until you get tired. Like it’s… the line ends here. You’re expected to go as hard as you can until that line. And so with weights and reps, you just keep extending that line a little bit. Look what you can’t do it. Hey, you know you tried, but there’s always an objective standard you could raise yourself to. And sometimes your body will take you there. And for me personally, like this is really true, especially as you get stronger because like when you’re squatting 400 4 sets of 10 your warm up with 400 for a double. Feels like, dude, I can get 3 and then I fucking break in half. Like there’s no way I can do those. How the hell… And then if it was just a standalone workout, I mean, you might feel your swag a little bit. You might do 400 for a set of 5 next time, pretty hard. You’re gonna… pretty good. Might do a set of 8, then a back off, set of 6. But if you go and look at your notebook and you’re like, last week I did 390 for 3 by 10, I’m gonna do 400 for 3 by fucking 10. I’m going to goddamn try. And then ten, ten, ten and you did it. But like, it took a lot and somehow you got it out of your muscles. Now, you know, you’re training hard and you just don’t have to worry about it anymore if that’s limiting factor. Another thing I would say is an interesting potential unlock for folks of that experience level is to do specialization phases, because you might have gotten away with 5 to 15 working sets per muscle per week, of for all your muscles up to that point, that’s probably the best way to go about it, because you’ll get a huge return on investment. Probably optimal there. But then at some point you’re going to be like, okay, I can crank my volume higher because the literature is crystal clear that cranking your volume, as long as you can recover is probably a good idea. And so you say, okay, there are probably two ways I can crank my volume. One way is I can do more sessions per week, like some people will train three times a week and then go: “My gains are stalled.” and I’m like, hey, there’s nobody on the IFB Pro stage trains three times a week, my friend. The five is probably the average, so try five or try to go to four and then see how four is, go to five. see how five is. So I’d say that’s a good idea. And also specialization by saying, okay, I can’t train everything with 30 sets a week. That’s crazy. I’m human. I’m going to break into pieces. I don’t have that kind of time. And I say, okay, well, most of my muscles I’ll train from 5 to 15 sets. Normally they get the normal gains, and as an intermediate I’ll take, 2 or 3 muscles per mesocycle or per block, a few mesos in a row and really, like, start at ten and just keep cranking the volume up until I get really fatigued and can’t do it any more. And sometimes, you know, for forearms it’ll be 35 sets a week. For biceps that’ll be 30, and for pecs, that’ll be 25. But you get up to pec training 25 sets a week for a few weeks, and your usual is like 10 to 15, you’re going to almost certainly see gains. And so that cranking that volume is something that we almost never tell beginners to do, because it’s just a good way to burn them out. And the return on investment is so marginal for them to make any sense. But the margins change when your intermediate because your regular gains are so small that even slightly bigger gains on an absolute level are at relative level much bigger gains for you, especially the difference between 0 and anything else is infinitely better gains if you think about it. So it starts to be worth it. So I’d say that’s another thing that you could try, really pouring more work effort into it. And then usually… So for intermediates, I wouldn’t say this, but if you’re a more advanced intermediate, I would say it’s probably time to start to work through more exercises in the gym to try different movements. And we have so many movements to try. You’re putting out content to different movements. Milo pack. All the stronger by science people, Jeff Nipper, myself, etc. there’s tons of great people. There’s no shortage of different exercises you can try, and exercises are often very individually specific. Like you like leg extensions? Yeah. Like they really screw you up. My friend, James Hoffman, doctor James… Leg extensions just totally wipe him out. I was like, I can do, like, 5 sets of leg extensions to a pure failure and just smoke a cigarette after and do 5 more, this doesn’t matter. I barely get a pump. Almost nothing happens. But if I do like a high rep set of belt squats or leg presses I can like with one set get sore for three days and some people are like my knees just hurt, I don’t know what the hell you’re doing on there. There’s so much variation and so many ways to move your body in space. So the not only should you be trying different exercises, but slightly different techniques. Do you put the bench bar here on the incline? Do you put it here? Do you put a here? Do you do a guillotine press? Experimenting with that can allow you with a mind muscle connection not only do I feel my muscle moving, but like how much tension do I feel through my muscle? Is it the proper muscle that I’m feeling in this? Is it my feeling triceps in my presses or my pecs, am I getting sore after? So on and so forth. Are the muscles really fatigue? Is the rep drop off really high? Like if you do some kind of new hamstring curl and you rep drop off as insane, you’re like, I cooked my hamstrings. Something happened. And so experimenting like that over a long term can clue you in on what exercises… and also you can do this with the rep ranges and all this other stuff, exercises, technique variants, rep ranges, different split designs to try to see, like, what’s the thing that fits me the best? Because for a lot of individuals, some splits and reps and exercises are just going to be like, oh, oh, this is perfect. Over the course of my career, I’ve had this hundreds of times where I tried something new and I was like, that sucks. What I was doing earlier was better. And also hundreds of times where I tried it and I was like, what the hell was I doing before I figured out how to do this? And I would say that exploratory thing, like, again, it’s not going to be like the difference between night and day, but per individual, some people get some good gains from hack squats, but put them on leg press and they’ll blow up and not only blow up, they like the exercise and it doesn’t hurt their joints as much. They’re axial and systemic fatigue is lower and they can progress on it for longer. And all of a sudden, like even though unit per unit time gives you the same hypertrophy, you’re just going to be able to milk more out with that other one. You know what I mean? It’s like, like, comfortable versus uncomfortable sex positions. Like, oh, they all technically do the job, but you’re going to like some more than others. Try a bunch, see what you like. And if you’re at home alone, like me, then don’t try anything and just look at adult films. -Speaking of specifics… Which exercise do you think… For body parts, let’s start with… Start on the bottom – calves, exercises that people should definitely try or exercise that you recommend most often. Calves are not the most exciting, I guess. -Calves are not the most exciting. Any kind of straight leg calf raise that unloads your spine is probably pretty good. So get on the belt squat, if you have one, go step off the ledge unrack the weight, get the belt going and go down really low off the ledge, hold for two seconds, come up about halfway until it feels easier, and then go back down. And I would do that like mile rep style or a very short rest breaks. I did that yesterday and like I’m not gonna be able to walk most of the rest of the day. It’s just like insane soreness for calves. So I say that’s a good idea. If you’ve been doing seated calf races with a bent leg, I think you just you’re going to get the first calf gains of your life doing this sort of thing. What’s next? Hamstrings? A properly executed stiff legged deadlift is a very rare thing. And, a good morning as well. Same movement really. It’s just is the bar here or here. Because a lot of people will do them and they round their back which unlocks the hips, takes the tension off the hamstrings, they don’t go sufficiently low. So I would say a very good well executed stiff legged deadlift can basically mean that were 2 or 3 sets per hamstring workout. You can get all the stimulus you need, which is really cool. For quadriceps… -Let’s talk… what about the leg curl? Do you think it’s necessary to keep a leg curl movement in there for the short head of the biceps femoris for example? -So like, for beginners and intermediates absolutely not because no one’s going to be able to tell. Neither are you. And you can always start leg curling later in your career and just get, like, awesome gains for the first time ever. If you want complete muscular development and someone who would be stepping on stage, and time is a thing you can afford, I would say like, yes, it’s a very good idea to do some kind of leg curl. What I typically do is if I train hamstrings twice a week, I will do one day where I do hinges and one day where I do curls. And I think it just checks both boxes really well. I would say it’s not the best idea to miss out on either one of those, unless you’re time constrained. And then just do whichever one fits all of your other goals and preferences better. So if you’re like a strength trainer and you want big deadlift and stuff… It’s probably not important for you to be doing many leg curls. But if you’re a person who just only cares about esthetics but you don’t have a ton of time, then I would say mostly leg curls versus hinges are better because they’re a better stimulus to fatigue ratio in many cases. At least, the total systemic and axial fatigue is quite low, they don’t take as much time to do, and they technically probably contribute to a more complete development of your hamstring, especially if you do them in a lengthened position, like a seated like curl with your chest propped forward like that. -For quads you earlier, you already mentioned typically higher rep, very deep type squat movements? -Yeah. -That’s your fave? -Yea, a fave. I would say one of my all time faves nowadays is a really good belt squat. A good belt squat where you come down all the way and sit for like 2 seconds at the bottom, and you come up 2/3rds of the way and come right back down slowly, do a mile rep style, so you get very close to failure, lock out your knees, breathe for 3 or 4 seconds, maybe 5 or 10, and then hit it again and again and again. Do like three rounds of that. Like, it’s actually possible to get a very good workout for many people with 1 set like that. And I think it’s, the axial fatigue is non-existent because the weight attaches at your hips. The systemic fatigue is quite low because it really just kind of is almost only quads at that point, especially if you sit in such a way that…. glutes, but if you sit with your knees going way over your toes, it also doesn’t do your glutes much. A little bit, but not a ton. Also, your glutes leverage against your hips, which leverage to your spine. So if there’s a part of your squat, where are you going like this, glutes are involved, but if the belt is low on your hips, like, glutes don’t even really do much for that. It could be all quads or most quads, definitely some glutes. So, I would say belt squats are like a huge unlock that… I didn’t used to do them because I kind of thought they sucked. But when I, a friend of mine recommended that I do them a certain way, I tried, it was really good, I iterated on that, and I improved it in my own way, and I was like, okay, this is the best quad exercise pound for pound stimulus to fatigue ratio that I found for myself in a long, long time. -What about ABS? Is there even an exercise that you think most people should do for their abs? -I don’t even know if most people should be training their abs. It really just depends on what they want. I like abdominal exercises. Like I like my women: hard, painful, long… -So which exercise would that be? -I like my ab exercises to be based on the same principles as all other exercises. I want them to be a relatively full range of motion with a very long lengthened component. I want them to be loadable, and I want them to be progressable, and I want them to be repeatable in a certain fashion. So I think actually a well-designed abdominal crunch machine with a select rise stack is probably one of the best ab exercises you could do. You could also hold weights and do like an inverted bench, 45 degree invert bench, those are quite good. V-ups are decent. Roll outs, ab wheel roll outs are phenomenal, though they do tax your tricep long head and your lats significantly. Not a big deal, but like if you’re sore everywhere you’re like… It’s just, like, it’s a difficult exercise systemically. But, that ability to have the longest length concomitantly present the biggest tension is huge. Ab rollouts are a little bit difficult to progress. Though I will say, if you can do with what I consider very good technique, 20 ab rollouts, you’re like… I don’t know, we can run you over with a truck and your abs would be fine. But, so there you don’t really need external load in most cases, but I’d say a good resistance profile crunch machine where you really open up and you really crunch down, you really control eccentric and you really crunch down, I mean, I think that’s really, really hard to beat. I just, like, planks and all this fucking shit, I just think it’s such a goddamn waste of time for physique and strength people in most cases. -Yeah, I like the… having the cable attachments with the rope putting it over your shoulders, and then, like a Bosu ball or any type of ball that you can really crunch over to get the range of motion, then use the cable stack, because you can do that in almost any gym. And good ab machines are quite a rarity in the gyms. -What do you do with your feet? -Just put them on the ground. If you get… if you get the right angles it usually works up to pretty high weights. -Okay. -But after body weights you would need some, something to put your feet firmly in place. -Yeah. I have, quite strong abs, and I have very short legs, so I just flip backwards. -Right. -But if you get a bench you put your feet under or a couple of plates, then that can be an excellent exercise for pretty much everybody. -Yeah. For most people, I think, if you dip yourself way to the front of the, the ball, the leverage, it’s usually all right up to around body weight. After that you do start flipping over a lot. -Sure. -Moving to glutes. -Oh, yeah. -Best booty builder. -I mean, front foot elevated smith machine lunges are just really difficult to beat from an experiential perspective. When, like, you can get IOMS from them. Instantaneous Onset Muscle Soreness. When you do one set per leg, you’re like: “Oh, I got a cramp if I move. I got a lay down or some shit.” So it just… -What you think is up with that, by the way, the insane level of soreness that you get in the glute ham tie-in with those types of exercises. I think it’s because most people just don’t do them with a high enough volume and frequency to get used to them. I think it’s just a repeat bout effect. -But specifically the location, right? It’s like very, like, glute ham tie-in. -Is that the case? I don’t know, for me it’s just a whole glute. -I got like the insane… That’s also like the standard bodybuilding law, there’s not really a glute ham tie-in muscle, right? There’s just the glutes… -No. Yeah. Correct. Well, I will say, you know, we do have some data to support the idea of that longer length tension does hypertrophy you distally more and that’s distal part of the glute. And that’s, that’s kind of what it is, I’d say that’s probably something to do with it, but… You know like hip thrust are fine. Hip thrust suffer from a few theoretical problems, a few practical problems. So, you know, like one is that you have to load a fuck load of weight onto a bar. Another one is that, you, the force curve is just backwards. It’s also an isolation exercise, so you just like training glutes by themselves, which is fine if that’s what you want. But a lot of times, like, why not train other stuff too. Front foot elevated Smith machine lunges train your quads quite well, they trainer adductors really well, and they train your glutes into the moon. And train your cardio and your ballsack really well too, because fuck that exercise sucks. And it’s embarrassing because you’re on the Smith machine with like 10s on each side and everyone’s like: “What the hell’s wrong with that guy? His legs are huge, right? He’s so weak!” and you’re like: “You try this, motherfucker!” And I usually do it after quads, so my quads are cooked anyway. So it really is just 10s on a side. It’s kind of embarrassing. -What do you think is wrong with the force curve on a hip thrust? -It is very difficult at the top and at the bottom anyone can lift like 8,000 pounds. -Yeah, true… -And so… -I mean, Bret Contreras might argue that you get probably the highest active mechanical tension in the glutes at the top. So maybe it’s a good thing? You argue it’s too much probably? -I mean like if a force curve was half as extreme, that might be the thing. Also like active mechanical tension is nice. Passive mechanical tension also grows muscle also lengthened tension is so dominant now that it’s difficult to say like how much active tension at the top can counter that? Some. But is it not balance a thing? I’ll say this is where I’m like just currently pretty much by myself in the evidence base community with my bullshit proxies like pump and soreness and fucking shit like that. I do think I still going to win that debate in the end sometime. The pump literature has been very good to me recently. It correlates quite well with growth, we’ll see how that ends up. But I say, like if I do 5 sets of hip thrusts, I get a decent pump, I get a little bit sore, and it’s novel, I haven’t done it before. I’m like, okay, this exercise works. Like, Menno, imagine doing five sets per leg of front foot elevated lunges for first time. Like you won’t come back to the gym. The raw stimulus magnitude is just incomparable. And so I’d say hip thrusts are very, very excellent by the best isolation exercises for glutes or near isolation exercise. And a lot of people like, yeah, the competitive aspirations or they already did enough squats, They don’t want their legs any bigger but they want bigger glutes, man, hip thrusts are… They’re just very difficult to beat. The variety of ways to rig them… Whoever makes the following machine first is going to make a substantial amount of money: Just make a cam leveraged hip thrust machine that makes it very difficult at the bottom, very easy at the top, I will fucking buy one and I will talk about it on the internet and you will sell lots of them. It’s just obvious at this point and no one’s done it yet. So I would say that is a very, very good way to go. And you don’t even have to have some kind of magical construction design. You just have a lever system that’s angled properly at the beginning and that’s it. So the barbell hip thrust is just… it just leaves so much to be desired. And if I have to put six plates onto something that’s on the ground and it’s not a deadlift, I’m just not doing it. -Yeah, a lot of people have that, it’s not time efficient. -Oh my God! -What about, erector spinae? You think squats and deadlifts? That’s all you need? Do you do isolation work for them? -I mean, like, depends on for what? If you want to do, you know -Bodybuilding -Yeah, absolutely. Like, there’s probably no reason to train your erectors for bodybuilding. I would say for overall health I’m increasingly more and more led to believe that dynamic movements for almost every joint are a good idea for preventative measures and for injury prevention, for overall robustness. So I love to do flexion rows of various forms. Cable flexion row, dumbbell, barbell… And that’s where you actually bend at the spine. Ever since I started doing that, like my spinal health, back health has just been like amazing. And I do like combat sport and so my back is always in very precarious positions. The thing is, if you’re very, very strong, just with a locked in posture and someone unlocks you or you bend down to pick up a cup and you pull something in your back because you’re never in spinal flexion. That used to happen to me all the time. I was a decent powerlifter and it still happened to me all the time. So I think some spinal flexion and extension is just a good thing. And for hypertrophy, for physique like rarely. I have really cool like gnarly gigantic spinal erector so I kind of don’t want to lose them and sometimes want to make them bigger just because it’s sweet look. So for vibes yeah, you can do those. But I think having a spinal erector dedicated like… -Like back extensions. -Yeah, back extensions are just like just not a good exercise for so many fucking reasons. They’re not loadable very heavily unless you get the barbell out, then you end up hitting the supports. Fuck this. The force curve’s all wrong because it’s very easy at the bottom, very tough at the top. So on and so forth. So I think, and also like, why not train the rest of your back while doing it? So I just say just do a row with the back extension and there is a flexion row. I do love the way cable rows feel, with the full flexion, because actually, when you’re fully flexed at the bottom of a cable row, the angle of pull for your lats is even better. And so it ends up being just like one of the best all around back exercises that you can do. So I would say this is not very important if you’re doing bent rows and you’re doing stiff legged deadlifts and stuff, I think you’re totally good to go. With squats. your erectors are going to be big and strong. If you have struggle with some back stuff before, I would say starting very light high rep and moving up slowly in weight for flexion rows of various kinds or just like… or Jefferson curls… It’s just like one of the best things you can do for your back. -All right. What about lats? -One arm crossed… I’m kidding. So for lats, man, I just every single time I get away from it, every single time I come back to it, just good old pull ups with any grip… So good, man, they’re so goddamn good. Whether do you want to do them body weight, whether you want to do them weighted… I would say get your chin to the bar, roughly, and then, especially in the bottom two thirds, really milk that eccentric. And you’re not going to able to do that many reps, it’s kind of embarrassing. But you like every time I just cannot beat the DOMS I get and the pumps I get from pull ups with any other back exercise. I’ve tried them all. Nothing compares. Assisted pull ups are awesome, but regular pull ups, man. There’s something special about them. And like, that’s just for me. Some people do them… -You mean pull ups or chin ups? Any grip. -I do not, as I never use the word chin up, ever. I’m not upset that you used it. I’m a little upset. -Convention is like it’s a chin up this way, pull up this way… -Yeah. It’s just like… The exercise to me is called pull up… -You pull yourself up. -Correct. I could even say it’s just called a chin up and then it’s various grips. Cause there’s neutral grip, overhand grip, wide grip, underhand and so on and so forth. There’s also like 45 angle grip which feels quite nice for many people. So I would say like there’s just no wrong answer on grips. It’s whatever feels nice to you. And a lot of them, the right answer is variation. You know, like if someone’s like, hey do you like, you know, blond girls or brunettes or… You would be like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Like, I’ll take them all, goddammit. Not on the same session because, you know, tend to get upset at each other if they’re in the same bed. -What about, rear delts? You do them with your back training? Do you need to isolate them? -Yeah, you need to isolate them if your rear delts are lagging and you can do some rear delt work. That’s quite good. I would actually say one of my favorite exercises for rear delts is the Smith machine. You could do it with the barbell, too. In a rack, the Smith machine inverted row. So you get the Smith machine, you plank your body and you pull yourself and, pulling height can be here, it can be here, it can be here, can be here. Somewhere between here and here is where most people will find, especially if they bring their arms back. Dude, I get a fucking rear delt pump from that. I almost never get a real pump from anything. Also, you get a deep tension, high tension at the stretch. Easier at the contraction because the angle improves for you, vectors get easier and so it’s actually like a really good force curve. It also beefs up the rest of your upper back, which is dope. If you’re spending all of your time on, like, just a rear delts, it’s kind of weird. It’s fine. Then, you know, cross body or rear delt cable stuff is excellent. I hate the rear delt machine. It almost does nothing for me at all, you know, just it ends up being a back exercise. I would just prefer to do the elbows, elbows up and out, face pulls against a barbell. The leverage advantage. You know the TRX? You know what that is? The TRX bands? Those are actually excellent for it because again, they incorporate leverage advantage and with them you can start low and pull high or start high and pull low whichever way hit your rear delts better. I think that’s an excellent exercise. What I generally say to people is I almost always treat rear delts like I treat front delts. I almost never train front delts on purpose. I almost never train rear delts on purpose. Because if you do proper full range of motion back training, bro, if you look at an anatomy book and you look at any back exercise… Pull ups. Tell me rear delt… If you had a tear, like a fucking avulsion in your rear delt, you could do pull ups? No fucking way. It’d be the most painful thing in the world. Oh shit. It looks like they contribute a very large fraction of the force. A lot of people just forget, like like like this… Like… Well, hold on a sec… What other function is part of the delts? To do this. And this. And so you’re doing like 18 sets of rear delts anyway all the time. If you need extra-dope, but what I like to do is for my shoulder volume, all of my shoulder volume, almost all of it, I like extra on the side delt because the side doesn’t get much from pushing and pulling and also the side delt has by far the most visual appeal. Like if you have big rear delts like yeah, it looks cool, if you have big front delts, you look strong, if you have big side delts, like you probably gettin pussy right now, big homie, you feel me? You can’t bat the pussy away, man. It just keeps following you everywhere. -It’s funny, even for rehab there’s research that compound exercises, which anything that pulls the elbow back will train the rear delts, are just as effective as all the standard rehab type external rotation and stuff. -I don’t even know. Don’t even get me started on that shit. -What about traps? Do you isolate those more? -On an as needed basis. I almost never isolate them. I went through a phase where for, like a year and a half I isolated traps, and they got bigger. -Which ones? Middle, lower, upper? -Upper. So because like, so with the way I row with a low angle rowing like mid traps is just not a problem. And so lower traps definitely not a problem. Upper traps could use more work, but honestly like the way, if you do a lot of side delt training, especially with dumbbells and machines and cross body, I mean, like your traps are working. -Do you actively shrug? -No, but what I do is I try to focus on completing the movement with good execution, and I try to focus to make sure that I can feel it in my side delts, you know, like the “elbow up” cue like, pulling with your side delts. But I never, ever, ever try to de-emphasize my traps. And I think that’s a critical problem that many people run into, because the overall neural drive, you can get into a muscle or, he’s going to be limited by your bandwidth mentally of doing 50 other things and be like, okay, do your laterals, focus on your delt delts-okay, focus on not using your traps-okay, focus on your 2017 tax returns, think of all that and what was your first girlfriend’s favorite food? You’d be like, I don’t even fuck I’m doing anymore. You’re not going to get high neural drive. So what I usually tell people is focus on your side delts in side delt training, your traps won’t take over, they will contribute like they’re fucking supposed to. Like when you have people squat, do you tell them focus on your quads? Or do you tell them don’t focus on your glutes? I don’t even know how the fuck to do that. How do you not focus on something? It’s fucking insane. And it’s a big problem because you end up like using 5 kilos instead of 10 kilos, and then you end up just like… oh, the fucking… you know the guys doing this fucking one armed shit, like just to here. And I’m like, why don’t you go higher? Why don’t you use more weight and like fucking: “My traps take over.” And I look at their physique. I’m like: “What traps, motherfucker? You don’t even have any goddamn traps.” And here’s a really good news. If you are working on your biggest side delts that you can and you train them normally your traps will get almost as big or bigger than you’ve even wanted, and that’s amazing. You never have to train your traps. I’ve literally seen men in the gym, guys that are trying to isolate their delts, like with all this crazy shit to get the traps out and then they do shrugs later and I’m just like, did you misunderstand how… it just baffles… that baffles me… -In general, I think there’s a myth in bodybuilding circles that if you get more activity in one muscle group, it must come at the expense of another and research very clearly shows that’s not the case. -Opposite. You know, often case is like really strong triceps can push your pecs to go to limits they wouldn’t be able to before because like you can get the concentric up with more triceps than you’re supposed to and on the eccentric it’s all pecs and your pecs like, dude, I can’t even do this anymore. You can really push your muscles super hard. Do some people have a mind muscle connection problem with a certain muscle? Yes, but don’t worry about the other muscles. Literally don’t think about the other muscles. Think about your pecs. don’t worry about what your triceps are doing. Think about pushing through your pecs. Then you might get a little bit of better result. But like the whole “this other thing is taking over”… Usually it means you need to focus more on the muscle. Here’s another thing. It means your technique might use some work. You imagine someone doing very close grip bench and be like: “I just feel it in my triceps?” Like, oh no shit, motherfucker. Widen your grip a little bit. Some people like… Oh, I’m just getting catty. I don’t, I don’t want to be all negative. But some people like, will talk about mind-muscle connection and feeling a muscle, and you’ll watch them do an exercise of their doing this shit and you’ll like you shut up. What are you doing? Have you ever seen Jared Feather train? When you train like Jared you get to talk about mind-muscle connection till you’re blue in the face. If you don’t train like that, at least start training in a way that externally I can tell you’re like trying to do something organized. Like, I should be like, man, I can’t. I don’t really feel my back in rows and you watch them do rows and they’re like this. You know, like, I don’t I don’t know what you feel at all. I don’t feel my hips or my dick coming out. I don’t know. By the way, do you like my content? Then you’ll love my online PT certification course.

Okay, back to the video. Speaking of triceps and pecs, what are your favorite exercises for those? -So for the pecs, this is like an exercise most people won’t run into. But cambered bar bench presses are just like GOATed beyond recognition. -For the extra range of motion. -Oh my god bro, that extra three inches, let me tell you. Am I right? It’s so big. It’s so big. -But about the bench press now… -Say it again. -We’re talking about the bench press. -Oh, for sure! I… There’s nothing big in my life I would ever say about. So, it’s now 3.5in. The, the stimulus is just wild because, like, on all the technical grounds, like, it’s a very stable movement, it’s a very loadable movement. And it’s very, it’s movement’s easy to replicate technique wise. And all of a sudden it’s a three inches extra insanely difficult eccentric. It just blows your pecs into the moon. So I’d say that’s great. I would say properly executed incline dumbbell presses into which you take the proximal edge of the dumbbell and you touch it to the proximal edge of your bicep or the distal edge of your front delt. Make sure you hear that correctly. I am talking about touching the dumbbell like three inches deeper than your pecs. Because guys do dumbbell press and they stop here. Sometimes they don’t even touch their pecs and I’m like… Every time we have someone on RP, we’re training, We’re like, watch this, we teach them the technique And after one set they’re like, “Oh, oh, holy shit! My chest.” Like, yeah, that’s that’s like pretty straight forward. So those are good exercises. Deficit push ups are amazing. For some folks that want overall chest development and respond well, slightly lean forward dips are actually quite good. I love bench presses. I think bench presses are amazing for the chest. And almost everyone… I know some people don’t like them and I totally get it. Almost everyone that doesn’t like the bench press, or incline press for pecs is almost always doing it wrong. Like they’re not arching or contracting. They’re not controlling the centric, they’re not pausing. Like, of course your fucking shoulders hurt. But they think some of those core movements are just really tough to be. A good press machine is excellent, one that allows you to go really deep, like, that Atlantis machine and things. A lot of… you’ve been around the world, training…. You ever trained on Technogym equipment? -Yeah. -Is there a way we can get the United Nations to, like, cease and desist like Technogym from, like spreading their equipment all around the world? -There’s a few manufacturers that are extremely popular for no reason, that to me that seems related to the quality of the equipment, like force curves are terrible. -Terrible. -Range of motion is not good. They just don’t fit well. The movement. So it feels like a little bit awkward. -Yes. It’s like, I’ve done some of their like lat pulldown stuff and I’m like, I’ve never been able to feel elbow pain on a lat pull down until now. And no lat pump. Like how did you guys do it? -They have some okay… They have some okay machines, but… -That’s one hell of a compliment. -What about triceps? You need isolation work? -Yeah, yeah. Like if you want the biggest triceps, you are behoove you to do isolation work. -What type? Push downs? -So I love skull crushers. The barbell or Smith machine or inverted skull crusher, All to me the same class of movement, are amazing because they have almost the perfect force curve. Especially if you do inverted skull crushers because they’re easier at the top. Way harder at the bottom. And, just by leverage. So I think skull crushers are excellent. I think most people who say they don’t get a lot of skull crushers or their elbows hurt are doing the movement in a way that’s not good for the body, they experiment with different things. Skull crushers. To me, it begins… so there’s a spectrum from close grip bench all the way to overhead behind the neck extension. It’s a full spectrum. So you can do incline skulls. You can do skulls to a bench behind you. You can do skulls to your actual skull. You can do eyes, nose, mouth, chin, throat. That’s actually one of the best exercises I have ever taught anyone. My arms are slightly too big to do it at this point, but. But can you guys see’em, that’s right, that’s right. If you can do this it’s so unbelievable. Get a spotter. But do skull crushers. So unlock at your elbows, I would generally do a false grip because it seems to be easier on the elbows, in my experience, unlock, and then in basically a straight line, come down to where you gently touch, like, open your chin, gently touch and pause for one second with the barbell touching your throat. It’s a deficit. Menno, it fucks people so bad. And it’s just it’s just going to annihilate you. And like that class of movement, deep skull crushers, amazing. Push downs are awesome. I don’t like rope push downs because like they emphasize the contraction, which is the least useful part of the movement and the stretch is kind of always like eh. If you do push downs, I do like people to do the Jared Feather technique where they stay upright and as they bring the bar up, they pull their elbows back to get a deep stretch. I don’t like push downs out front. They’re cool. People are like, yeah, but fucking long head like, yeah, dope. There’s like 18 other ways to train your long head. One of them is just all back movements train your long head quite well. All pulling movements. The other thing is overhead work. I don’t do overhead work for my triceps anymore. Mostly because, I just got big enough to where like… You almost never see, like, like national level guys and pro level guys doing overhead, behind neck extensions. And you’re like, is it just a bro thing? And the reality is they just can’t put their arms there anymore. Like it just doesn’t work. I used to do them for a long time. -They’re too big. -Literally just too big. There’s too much stuff in the way. I did them for a very long time. Some of the very flexible guys can do it, and it’s always a beautiful thing. Unfortunately not in the cards for me, but I did them for years. I did them with a straight bar, I did them with EZ bar… EZ bar standing overhead extensions where you focus on… Your elbows can actually flare any way you want. It’s a decent cue to flare them forward, at least on the way down. Make sure your elbow is pushed really far ahead of you, so it’s like in a squat… You don’t want to squat back and down for your quads, you want to squat forward and down. And so in an overhead extension, you actually want your elbows to move forward as you come down as opposed to back. Now, back work great too but if you move them forward and down, you actually get the peak tension exactly at the peak stretch. And keep them nice and close. Like sets of 15 to 20. EZ bar… Just annihilation. It’s an amazing exercise. Fucks your long head up, fucks every head up. So overhead extensions with cables, with barbells, with EZ bars are awesome. So we have: skull variations, push down… So actually, to use the better anatomical procedure: push downs, skulls, incline variation and overhead. I would do some combination of all those rotated through the years. And I would say for most people, for full development, have some kind of movement that’s either a push down or a skull, one part of the week for triceps or a few of the days, and then one or a few of the days have some kind of overhead movement that you do. And I think it really squares away everything. Dips are excellent, but dips are one of those things like, like in the RP Hypertrophy App we have dips as a tricep exercise, but there’s some nuance there because it does hit your chest. It’s kind of like, oh, it’s kind of more 50-50… There are ways if you plank your body very vertical and when you’re dipping, instead of taking your shoulders and putting them really far forward, which is more chest you actually, this is really difficult, you break and then you let your elbows slide back, but keeping upright. It ends up making like this arm angle at the bottom and it’s fucking brutal. You’re like, oh, I can do 10 dips. Like everyone’s looking at you at the gym. Like this guy is an idiot. In regular dips he could put 225 on and go for forever. Those kinds of dips where you really extend your elbow out, phenomenal for triceps. What I like to do is, for many people to get quite strong, do like 5 sets of overhead extensions or push downs or skulls, and then go do 4 or 5 sets of dips. Holy shit. Like you’re going to do sets of 5 to 10 dips, and every set is going to be like your muscles just burning alive. And it’s all really good. -And then finally, the muscle that all the bros have been waiting for, the guns-biceps. -We did chest already, didn’t we? I’m an idiot. The biceps. So, like, at this point I’ve become like a trillionaire, spoiled bicep exercise enthusiast to where like, if you pick me up in a Mercedes and it’s not a Rolls Royce I’m like, oh, I’m sorry, sir, I’m waiting for my vehicle. And you’re like, I am the vehicle. I’m like, no, there’s been a misunderstanding. I’d never set my foot in one of these. So like barbell curls and shit, cable curls, like they fuck, they’re dope and they work, they’re effective, so they’re great. Feel free to use them. But once you’ve tasted the nectar of inclined curls with a very deep incline, lying curls, on a bench or what… probably my favorite all time bicep exercise… I’m not saying it’s the best, just I love it. Free motion behind the back curls. So really Bayesian curls, but with two arms at a time. And, just basically like the attachments, you step forward and you get the supports to basically be orthogonal to you here so that the cable is pulling back exactly at the bottom. Here you go really far behind your back. I actually did that line curls yesterday, my biceps are sore as fuck. And you pull really far back and then you come up and curl. At the very top here it’s super easy, which is exactly what you want. And you can back up rest for a second, keep going with myo reps. Easy to set up, easy to warm up for. I mean, it’s just like God’s exercise for biceps and it fucking looks lame. But god damn does it screw you up in the best possible way. And because it pulls your elbows back for you and everything, it’s actually, I think, amazing for shoulder health and elbow health because it really stretches the dog shit out of everything. So that. If you don’t have one of those free motion machines, I would say doing dumbbell curls, lay down on a bench and then take dumbbells, come out here, go all the way and up and down… Phenomenal, because the lengthened situation is amazing. The stretch situation is amazing and all of a sudden it’s just a great movement and very easy to do. Myo reps with is not systemically fatiguing. That’s another thing. You lie down and do bicep curls. Like you can do that until you’re blue in the face. Like when you get strong enough standing barbell curls are kind of annoying because like, I don’t know, do you get, like, I get my back gets tired from doing standing barbell curls pretty heavy. I’m just like, ugh… -Yeah. I’m not a big fan of barbell curls in general, -Which is a backwards force curve for hypertrophy. -You don’t get full range motion. You can, if you push your elbows forwards, it’s a little bit better, but then you actually do feel your core a lot with heavy weights. -Yes, yes Jared does that… The Jared curl like that but also like yes, you’re now you get the length and tension, but you’re no longer getting the stretch because you’re actually getting less stretch. And so it’s kind of like you could, you can you can rig curls to be good. Or you can do line curls or behind the back curls and just get like, amazing results. Yeah. -So two things we touched on a few times are good exercise technique, lengthened bias… Actually, third thing is progressive overload. Like to go into those things in bit more detail with problems that people currently face and the last studies. -Yeah. One thing with progressive overload, a lot of people have issue with… They increase the weight, they try to do more reps, but then it comes at the expense of technique. Mindset wise, training wise… How do you deal with maintaining good technique, not compromising range of motion while implementing progressive overload? -I’ll make an analogy here that’s maybe a little funny, but… it’s a stretch, but I think it has some wisdom in it. And I say, you’re hooking up with someone, right? You’re doing the deed. Anyway, sorry. I hope that sound comes through. You’re going back and forth at a certain amplitude… -Amplitude… -Amplitude, man… She’s like: “Oh my God, give me amplitude!” What? Stop picking up physics grad students. -”Increase force output!” -”Oh my God! Let’s do this in an accelerator!” You’re like, “I don’t know if that’s a good idea!” So how important is your amplitude? How important is your rhythm? How important is frequency? How important is all those things important for stroking. Right? How important is it that you are still inside of the vagina? I would say it’s of preeminent importance, because that’s the only place that that matters. It’s a stretch. It’s an exaggeration, but there’s some grain of truth to that that applies to technique. The purpose of technique is not for evidence based bros to be: “Good technique, bro!”, though it does do that. The purpose of technique is to put the tension where you need it to make the stimulus happen. And to keep you safe and to let you know like am I really progressing or am I bullshitting myself. Standardized technique. So technique to me is like a first principles. I don’t like the term first principles because there are many layers of principles, but a lower level of principle than how many reps you’re doing. It’s within the context of good technique, how many reps you’re doing. Here’s a better analogy. You’re doing a bicycle race and you decided to take a shortcut. You won the race, but they don’t give you a trophy and they say you can never compete again. And you’re confused. But I raced my bicycle to the finish line. No, idiot. You were supposed to go around this way, not through this way. Oh that’s right. So because technique allows us to maximize the stimulus, allows us to minimize injury risk and fatigue, and allows us to make sure that we standardize and we know our progression is happening, then technique is something we do not trade out ever. So people always ask me, when is your time to throw technique out the window? Like never. And certainly there are times where I can bullshit you and do nuance. And when I talk to bros, I got to be like, well, sometimes it’s fun, YOLO and all that shit. But real talk, I feel like for real though, like never. Good technique is good technique. And then everything on top of that is like, oh, I can’t do another rep if I use good technique. Good job. Your set is over. Well, I need more stimulus. Sweet, take five seconds of break and do a myo rep, or take two minutes and do another set, or do lengthened partials. But if you have to like, throw your technique off completely to do more reps, I think you’ve really like, you’ve made a fundamental mischaracterization of why you’re in the gym. You’re not in the gym to do reps, you’re not in the gym to… RP Hypertrophy App says 15 reps at 300 pounds, you’re not there to get 15 reps. You are there to stimulate the muscle, which means you do good technique and then however many reps you can with good technique. Is 15 the goal? Yes. Do 15. Can you not do 15? Then it’s 14 and you’re done. To me, Menno, it’s that simple. Am I missing something? -Mindset wise you basically have to get zero tolerance policy. You just have to… -Great question. Not zero tolerance in an insane OCD way because guys will be like, their elbows will do this, they say: “That’s it. I’m failing.” No no no no no no no no no no no. Fundamentally decent technique, right? So like sometimes you’re… We’re going to getting banned on YouTube for the shit I’m going to say. It’s going to use another vagina analogy. Like it is not true to say that your penis has to go all the way in every time and almost all the way out every time. Sometimes you can have a few mid strokes in there, sometimes a long strokes, but make sure it’s still in. Technique is how I look at it. Like, are you still doing the range of motion that you try to do? Is your ability to control your body still decent? Like if you’re doing dumbbell press, this is what a good rep looks like. This is what a bad rep looks like? Fuck it, send it, do another one. But if a bad rep looks like this, like bro, you’re done. If someone who’s a third day at the gym can tell you you have bad technique you’re not doing good technique anymore. So there’s a tolerance limit. But the tolerance limit is small enough to know, like I’m still doing the thing. Let me give you another decent analogy. Driving a car. Just don’t get half your car on the other lane. If your wheel hits this lane a little bit and then that lane, you’re good. But don’t drive on the fucking wrong side of the road. And I think most people, when they struggle with what’s perfect technique and what’s good technique, a lot of times they really know what it is but it’s very easy to give yourself the excuse to say, oh, my technique is not good anymore because you could push it further and still have decent technique. Here’s another thing. I’ll speak for Jared, though he’s not here. What Jared would say is this: when you feel that your technique is slipping, that’s when it’s time to have even better technique. Like, oh fuck. Like, oh, I don’t know if I can do this with a good technique. Sweet. Really retract and go again. But now think even more technique and even more strength. It’s not versus. It’s at the same time. It’s like, do I swing my sword around like this with zombies or I do like…. Well, no. You do the Roman short sword. It’s athletic, it’s fast, but it’s also precision. It’s both. It’s both, like, that’s the best way to describe it. So don’t get psychotic and OCD and be like, oh, as soon as my elbows are off… As soon as your technique feels off-fix it. Fix it right there for the next rep. And if you’re trying your goddamn best and your technique is really getting wacky, then it’s time to go. Technique is one of those things, like something they say about, like collapsing nations and armies and stuff is everything seems fine until the whole thing goes, you know. Technique is one of those to me where if you really try to focus on it again and it doesn’t work, then, you know, it’s no go. -Right. And how do you feel about the recent preprints that came out that’s show supposedly technique doesn’t matter? Yeah, for those that don’t know. Yeah, it’s a group of untrained individuals. It’s a limitation. Trained one arm with push downs and biceps curls. One arm did strict technique, elbow at the side, just the elbow motion, and then the other arm used a lot of body movements, body English where the push downs kind of turning into a dip, like lean into the weight and for the curls really swing up the weights and make sure you get the weight up kind of no matter what. And they got essentially equal gains in this eight week study. -I mean there’s a usual limitations of first of all it’s only a weak second of all it’s on untrained people. Another problem is one study at a time shows you almost nothing and then multiple studies together show you something. So taking all those limitations, I would say if we just say, okay, actually, this study is revealing the ground truth and this study turns out to be one of those, like, really middle of the bell curve studies after 20 studies are conducted. Let’s just assume that for experiment, for just like thought experiment sake. I would say what that studies illustrated is that you get roughly the same growth for if you cheat or if you don’t cheat. And there is a way to interpret that it doesn’t matter if you cheat or not. And that way to interpret that study is wrong. Because if you take your car and you drive 150 miles an hour, and you get to someplace weaving in and out of traffic and you get to that place at the same time as someone who drives 60 miles an hour and drives calmly, you can say, it just doesn’t matter how fast you go. And that’s true as far as the measured variable of how soon you get there. Because like, everyone ran into traffic and it just didn’t matter. But that’s looking at part of the picture. I’ve never heard anyone say that strict technique will have a very high effect of maximizing your direct stimulus to the muscle. I’ve never made that claim myself as far as I can tell. For some people the technique is so bad that that’s the case, but for most folks it’s just fine. So what I’m saying is if you do cheat curls your biceps will grow plenty big and strong. The thing is what are you paying? What are the costs? So you’re using more weight to get the same effect, or you’re doing more reps to get the same effect. -Which was indeed the case in this study. -Correct? You spend extra energy from all the other muscles of your body. You are needlessly exposing yourself to injury risk and fatigue. -Because of the higher weights? -Because the higher weights, because you’re doing more mechanical work. And the mechanical work… Imagine there’s another way to say this. Like the two groups did very different amounts of mechanical work. The cheat group did much more work, but only got the same exact results. Holy shit, why would you do that? And so if you think that doing cheat reps like bent rows, cheat bent rows, cheat curls, is going to grow you muscle. Well, you’re right, but how many more sets of bent rows could you have done if you just did strict technique and just had more energy to do more sets of bent rows? And how much better would your leg workouts go two days later because you didn’t use your posterior chain to lift half the weight? The answer is it’s meaningful and significant. And so what I would say is this study is hopefully one of many we’ll see in the future that I think probably will illustrate the fact that cheating is a fine way to get direct gains, but the stimulus to fatigue ratio is just highly suboptimal. The stimulus to risk ratio is highly suboptimal. There have been many people who have done strict curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people screw themselves up on… or sorry, strict curls, cheat curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people get hurt doing strict curls. And so at the end of the day, it’s like if I’m taking all of these other risks and imposing this much fatigue on the rest of my muscles, on my system, on my spine, what else am I getting out of it? And the answer is nothing. Well, gee whiz, man, that means really, that good technique is a really good thing. And to me, the study is just a really good partial recognition of the fact that good technique has really big upsides. So we did not need a study on this. We could have reasoned through it. Good to have a study because our reasoning could be wrong. It’s never a good bet unless you have empirical testing. But, that’s the way I interpret the study is like, yes. So on mechanistic grounds, there’s I wouldn’t actually predict that you could have less growth. Like, I’ll put it this way… If the study discovered that there’s significantly less growth for the cheat rep condition, I would actually be a little bit confused. Like, fuck man, I guess my muscle connection really does matter a lot or something. Like maybe like, I don’t know, like the triceps don’t really get to failure because everything else did. It would really be confusing. And the high absolute forces on the eccentric and stuff like they help, they help, but apparently they don’t help enough. And so the stimulus to fatigue ratio, stimulus to risk is not great. And now it’s something that we can be more confident about saying. No doubt people will put out the study and comment and Instagram comments on YouTube about how technique is done and cheat reps work and it would just say that most of those people just haven’t thought it through sufficiently and most of those people aren’t the kind of people that need to think about things. They do have a feeling. And then they later do the very mild level of thinking on top of that, to justify their feelings. -Another area that we’ve had a lot of studies on recently that work mostly in the negative is the lengthened bias. So we had a lot of really compelling research initially coming out pretty much at the same time, an avalanche of research in favor of exercises with more lengthened bias, even lengthened partials beating full range of motion training. And then last month alone, we had meta analysis, well, October this was… Meta analysis showing that lengthened exercises have basically a trivial effect size in favor or over shortened exercises like training at longer muscle lengths does produce more growth, but it’s pretty much trivial. And then we had two studies in trained individuals showing pretty much equal growth with lengthened partials versus full range of motion training, in contrast to the basically two other studies, compelling studies that we had showing at lengthened partials even beats full range of motion training interestingly. And now we also have a study showing that, cable lateral raises didn’t significantly produce more growth, a bit of a trend… -I saw that… -than dumbbell lateral raises. So has the tide turned? Is lengthened bias still something you should seek out in your training? -If you look at all the studies together, there is still a clear relationship that the lengthened component is extra special. I don’t think it’s by like double or triple the growth. I never thought that. I think it’s by a margin, but I think it’s one of those things where if you can easily do exercises that accommodate a longer length, if your stimulus proxies also agree, like it gets you way more sore, way more pumped, way more locally fatigued, and has allowed you to progress faster and see better visual gains than I would say, because you have full decision about what to do in the gym, I would say my best advice, and this has been the case for a long time, if you can manage to, don’t skip the deep bottom stretch of an exercise and pick exercises that load the deep bottom stretch extensively. Whatever else you do, do you want to do partials? Sweet. Do you want to do full range? Cool. Do you want to squeeze at the top? Dope. But if you have an exercise in which you’re missing that like bottom half or the bottom half is there but with like incline curls, it’s just not loaded. I say probably not doing your best to get the growth that you want. Is it marginal? Absolutely. Could you just do more sets of shortened partials and still get the same growth? Yeah, definitely. Stimulus to fatigue ratio. Does that make sense? No, not a ton. I think the local fatigue imposed by lengthened partials is massive. But that’s what you want. For similar or lower systemic fatigue, which is good. So I say my my best tentative conclusion for now, this could change, is at the very least try to have most of your exercises not obviously skip the lengthened component and try to load it extensively. Does that mean you should be doing lengthened partials for everything? I’m not confident enough to say that yet. The recent literature has not been kind to it yet or so far, and so I would say at the very least, just don’t skip that bottom part and really focus on it and whatever else you want to do is kind of like, no one really knows what else is better. Just for a bunch of functional benefits and stuff I think full range of motion is kind of cool. And so what I would say is… and there was a direct study on this a little while back where it was like emphasizing the lengthened component with full range versus just lengthened and they got essentially the same results, I’d say, like, yeah, like… That’s more or less how I train much of the time is emphasizing the bottom stretch, but still going through most of the top. -Right. It makes sense. I think in general, a big confusion is that people have, with fitness research they interpret something as like this is now debunked. -Yeah. -Whereas if you look at it purely empirically, like, like a statistician, many of the things we recommend that we have in common, even though we disagree on some things, is that almost all the things we recommend purely statistically, even if you don’t know the mechanisms, you have no idea if this study is good, that study is good, but research overwhelmingly shows it’s either positive or neutral, and the chance of it being detrimental is very small. -Yes. -And you could make that argument with high frequency training, with lengthened partials, like with partials maybe not so much, but at least making sure that you stimulate muscles at long muscle lengths. -Yes. -It’s going to be either positive or maybe at worst neutral. But, based on the current literature, the chance of it being harmful is really, really small. -Yeah. Yeah, harmful or missing out on obvious gains. -Yeah. -Which is the biggest harm of all. -Yeah. -Yeah, 100%. And I think people often also mistake or just don’t understand… Not to their, you know, not trying to, you know, disparage anybody, but like, effect sizes are just something people don’t really know. Most people think, they just don’t know the difference between significance and effect size. And just to sort of clear this up. So significance is like, can you even really say you’re looking at two different things? Even though they might be very, very like someone’s like, okay, here’s significance, ready? You get two different species of South African ant, and a really like deep dive insect person would be like, yeah, those are two different species. They look the fucking same. They’re both tiny and damn near equivalent, but they actually are different. But are they different in any meaningful way? Like well, this one not bite me? Like no, they both fucking bite you. Like, okay. Do they behave differently? Like not really, they’re about the same. But they’re different. We know they’re different. That’s significance. So when someone’s like, oh, this is significantly better. Like, you know, it’s almost certainly really better. Effect size is by how much better. And so it’s kind of like, oh, oh, here’s actually a better one than the ant analogy. You get 2 pro boxers, a guy that’s ranked #1 and a guy that’s ranked #3. Is it true that the rank one guy is significantly better? Yes. Is it true that the effect size of him being better is high? No. Every third match he lose to the other guy and also, if you look at a guy at a club and he looks at you wrong, you’re like, “The fuck is that guy?” Like, “Oh, that’s the boxer dude.” You’re like “Yeah, what’s his rank?” Like? “He’s #3.” Like “I’m going to fuck him up!” Like, no you’re not. No you’re not because you’re ranked nothing And he’s going to… he’s like ten times the boxer you’ll ever be. That’s effect size. So we go back to the exercise science literature. People will say, you know like lying leg curls are inferior to a seated leg curls in many experiments. True. Significant. So they’re different. But like lying leg curls are like the, #3 boxer and seated are like #1, like they’ll both fuck you up big time and the differences between them are nuanced and also if you match up to that #1 boxer and like, you have some kind of advantage where you’re like, you’re a southpaw or you have really big reach, you actually have better results against the #1 guy then against the #3 guy, the #3 guy comes way into your circle too match, his uppercut game is out of this world, his body shots are gnarly, and while that #1 guy can neutralize him, you can’t. And so it’s actually better for you to be fighting the #1 guy. And for some people lying leg curls work definitely better than seated leg curls. And if you do seated leg curls for six months straight by novelty alone lying leg curls will be better. That’s how close it is. And I think some people will confuse those two. They’re different by a margin versus they’re meaningfully different in a way that you can apply and that’ll take things like, oh man, like so we don’t do anything at a shortened length anymore. Like, no no no, they’re still great, but like, it’s probably true to say that on average it’s a little bit better to emphasize the lengthened component, and it’s a bit of nuance there, for sure. The reality is like, you know, go to the gym, read the literature, do generally the stuff that’s a good idea, experiment with the stuff that maybe you don’t know about, the stuff that’s not as good-try it anyway and see if you like it and if you like and it works for you, great. Fucking do it. But, don’t pretend like, you know, some things are just categorically just night and day better than others. Those things do exist, for sure, but they’re mostly like, how do I get my quads bigger? Is it doing bicep curls or is it doing leg extensions? Like, yes, you will see very big effect sizes there. -Mike Israetel, everyone. I would tell you to promote your products or anything, but everyone on this channel knows who you are.

Shandong Yulong Petrochemical started up its first crude processing unit of 200,000 bpd in September 2024. This unit has kept crude processing rates at 90% of capacity since November. Now the refiner, whose refining and chemicals complex is worth $20 billion, is set to begin trial runs at the second crude unit of another 200,000 bpd at the end of March, according to the trading sources who spoke to Reuters. The new refining unit could raise crude oil imports in the world’s top crude buyer after recent slumps due to tepid domestic fuel demand. But more fuel production could also depress already weak refining margins in China and the region. Faced with a hectic reorganization of the crude trade following the U.S. sanctions on Russia, Shandong Yulong Petrochemical has reportedly boosted purchases of West African and Brazilian crude in recent weeks. The Chinese refiner last month bought four shipments of crude from Angola and Nigeria a trade source familiar with the deals told Reuters in February. Shandong Yulong Petrochemical booked a cargo each of Angola’s Dalia, Plutonio, and Girassol crude and one cargo of Nigeria’s Nemba, all for delivery in March. The Chinese refiner has also bought two shipments of crude from Brazil for delivery in April, according to the source. At the same time, China’s crude oil imports over the first two months of the year fell by 5% compared to the same period of 2024 as the parting round of sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Russian energy affected international flows.

Title: CVS is opening smaller stores that only have pharmacies | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about the half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy — ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS’ turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They’ve also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they “will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.” “By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,” a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Related article Will private equity kill Walgreens? Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has “done very little to defend revenue” of the front-end of its stores. “It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it’s not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there’s growing competition from chains like Walmart,” he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Get to know Ireland’s three medal winners from the European Indoor Championships

Sarah Healy Age: 24 Club: UCD Athletics Club The first time Sarah Healy heard Amhrán na bhFiann play out after her victory on the track, the assumption was she wouldn’t be waiting too long to hear it again. And she wasn’t, as two days after winning the 3,000m at the European Under-18 Championships in Gyor, Hungary in July 2018, Healy also won the 1,500m. Then came a series of near misses after running from the front – second in the 1,500m at the under-20 championships in 2019, second again at the under-23 championships in 2023, narrowly beaten by Sophie O’Sullivan – before some seven years later, Healy did get to hear Amhrán na bhFiann again after she won the 3,000m at the European Indoor Championships on Sunday. 🇮🇪☘️ Sarah Healy’s gold medal-winning moment in the 3000m. 🥹#Apeldoorn2025 pic.twitter.com/hy6pZy0nI4 It was a historic win for Irish athletics, Healy the first Irish woman to win gold at these championships which have been running since 1970, but it was deeply satisfying in a personal sense, given some of the setbacks she has endured. Healy choose to stay home rather than pursue a US scholarship, studying law at UCD while also adjusting to competing in the senior grade. Equally committed to her academics, graduating in 2023 with honours, she was by her own admission often prone to losing concentration in her races. In May 2022, she ran a world-class time of 4:02.86 for 1,500m at the at the World Athletics Continental Tour gold meeting in Ostrava, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record of 4:05.81 set 31 years previously in Monaco. But at the 2022 European Cross-Country Championships she suffered a bone stress fracture in her foot, requiring a lengthy lay-off. Still, Healy never lost her focus on where she wanted to go. After being carefully nurtured by her coach Eoghan Marnell at Blackrock AC, they realised the need to go beyond the big fish in the small pond scenario, and Healy moved to the husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, based in Wigan, whose group included Keely Hodgkinson, who won gold in the 800m at the Paris Olympics. There’s a newfound confidence and consistency about Healy’s running since, and nowhere was that more evident than in Apeldoorn on Sunday, where she held her nerve to hit the front for the first time inside the last 50m, right when it matters most. Mark English Age: 31 Club: Finn Valley AC They sometimes say your sport chooses you, not the other way around, and things might have been different had Mark English not been spotted winning the egg and spoon race at his school sports day in Letterkenny. For a while after English continued to focus on Gaelic football, playing with Letterkenny Gaels, encouraged by Colm McFadden – former All Star, current Donegal selector and one of English’s teachers at St Eunan’s College. English however soon realised his true potential was in athletics, particularly the 800m which requires that delicate combination of speed and endurance. Still he stayed close to Donegal football, standing in Hill 16 when they won the All-Ireland in 2012. That was the same year English lowered his 800m best to 1:45.77, the fastest under-20 time in Europe in 2012, just .17 shy of the Olympic A-standard for the London Olympics. Athletics Ireland choose not to nominate him on the B-standard, and at the time that hurt. Despite several enticing offers to take up a US scholarship, including at Villanova, English choose to stay at home, opting for UCD. Originally enrolling in physiotherapy, he later transferred to medicine, studying alongside Jack McCaffrey, where the talk was who might be the fastest in that class (Note: there would only be one winner). He won his first Irish senior title indoors in 2011, aged 17, and now, 14 years later and a qualified doctor, English has repeatedly broken the Irish 800m record indoors and out, and is still running stronger, faster, and more determined than ever. His bronze medal in the 800m on Sunday was his fifth European medal in all, making him the most decorated male athlete in the history of Irish athletics. Kate O’Connor Age: 24 Club: Dundalk St Gerards AC It was at the time seen as one small step for Irish athletics, and one giant leap for Kate O’Connor, who in winning the heptathlon silver medal at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships in Boras, Sweden back in 2019, first wrote her own little piece of history. No Irish woman had ever won a championship medal at any level in the heptathlon, the seven-event disciple demanding all-round talent and athleticism, and O’Connor had already made sure of it going into the final event, the 800m. The then 18-year-old from Dundalk St Gerard’s Athletics Club, coached by her father Michael, was racing to determine which colour, and in the end was rewarded with silver, her total of 6,093 points also smashing the existing Irish senior record, the first time any Irish woman had surpassed 6,000 points. O’Connor later won silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, representing Northern Ireland, and last summer in Paris became Ireland’s first representative in the Olympic heptathlon, finishing 14th. Still, Sunday’s bronze in the pentathlon – the indoor, five-event version of the women’s heptathlon – was another giant leap, given O’Connor jumped from fourth to third in the last event winning the 800m outright in 2:11.42. It was the first medal won by any Irish athlete in a senior multi-event. Her 800m time at was enough to bring the 24-year-old’s total to 4781 points, improving again on her previous Irish indoor record of 4683 set last month. Her father still oversees much of her training along with Tom Reynolds, and she’s currently dividing her time between Dundalk and Belfast, where she’s completing a Masters in Communications and Public Relations at Ulster University. The outdoor season and her return to the heptathlon now promises even more.

Title: Novo Nordisk's Ozempic successor disappointed Wall Street again

Time Published: 2025-03-10T14:31:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.00%) released clinical trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Monday, disappointing Wall Street for the second time. The pharmaceutical giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, announced on Monday that patients taking its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema, lost an average of 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks in a phase 3 clinical trial. This was the second of four planned phase 3 studies of the drug. The first trial, called REDEFINE 1, tested CagriSema in people who were obese or overweight but did not have type 2 diabetes. In that study, patients lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The second study, REDEFINE 2, focused on 1,206 patients who were obese or overweight and had type 2 diabetes. Neither trial met the company’s or analysts’ expectations of a 25% average weight loss. Novo Nordisk had hoped that by mimicking multiple hormones, CagriSema would deliver greater weight loss. The drug combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.29%) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk’s stock fell more than 8% on Monday morning following the news. “We had believed that adults living with both overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes represent the patient segment for which CagriSema has the best chance to outperform Zepbound. Therefore, we believe today’s results are especially disappointing,” William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh wrote in a note. CagriSema belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, popularized by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.81%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. As a result, several pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss medications. Novo Nordisk currently plans to file for regulatory approval for CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. Meanwhile, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX-6.06%) and Amgen (AMGN-2.11%), which are also developing next-generation weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 3.5% and 1%, respectively, on Monday.

Title: Wall Street Is Quietly Hinting At Major Ideological Shift Toward Bitcoin This Year

Time Published: 2025-03-10T13:32:49Z
Full Content:
ByDan Runkevicius ByDan Runkevicius , Senior Contributor. President Trump Trump with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House crypto czar David Sacks. On his first day in office, Trump made a bold promise: Bitcoin will have regulatory clarity by midyear. Soon after, the Jan. 23 executive order followed, directing the nation’s top policymakers — from the Treasury secretary and SEC chair to the CFTC chair and attorney general — to find a way to integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. Even ruling out edge cases like a full-fledged “national bitcoin reserve,” Trump’s wishlist, detailed in the order, marks the most aggressive pro-crypto push in Bitcoin’s history. And there’s already progress. Right after taking office, Trump’s appointed acting SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, revoked SAB 121, an accounting rule that forced banks to put crypto on their balance sheets, making custody impractical. What actually comes out of Trump’s pro-crypto push is still unclear, but Wall Street looks eager to call it a done deal. From financial advisor surveys and money flows to Wall Street’s recent investments, a mounting pile of data points to a major ideological shift about Bitcoin at an institutional level—one that goes beyond empty talk. On Jan. 14, 2024, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, giving institutional investors a backdoor into Bitcoin. These funds solved three key problems that had kept big money on the sidelines: compliance, tax inefficiencies, and custody. For the first time, institutions could buy Bitcoin as easily as the S&P 500. The result is nearly $113 billion in inflows in under a year—representing about 10% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Demand was so off the charts that Bitcoin outpaced every other asset class — including its ideological rival gold — becoming the fastest-growing ETF debut ever. In the first three trading days, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $10 billion. For perspective, gold took nearly three years to hit that mark in the early 2000s. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it “insane.” Since its launch, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust — the first spot Bitcoin ETF — has collected $53 billion in assets, making it the fastest ETF to hit the $50 billion mark. “I wasn’t sure we’d ever see it, but I’ve never seen anything like it in my career, something going from $0 to $50 billion in basically six months,” BlackRock CFO Martin Small said earlier this month at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference. Within their first year, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up more than $100 billion in assets. Considering that gold ETFs ended last month with $306 billion in assets, Bitcoin is already a third of the way toward matching gold in terms of ETF safe-haven demand. This isn’t just a retail-driven frenzy. According to SEC fillings, institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs has tripled over the last quarter from $12.4 billion to $38.7 billion. That’s in stark contrast to a 69% rise from retail investors, according to Fintel. Ironically, “institutions are perhaps the only investors that remain excited about cryptocurrency right now,” Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, told me. And there may be good reason why. Not long ago, Wall Street slammed Bitcoin as the biggest fad in history. Warren Buffett famously called it “rat poison squared,” and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon dismissed it as “worse than tulip bulbs.” But many fund managers who once wrote off Bitcoin have changed their tune. BlackRock and Fidelity have both issued Bitcoin ETFs. Goldman Sachs quietly bought up $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs in 2014. In April 2022, Fidelity became the first firm to let employees add Bitcoin to their 401(k) accounts. Last year, Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street bank to allow its advisors to offer Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Yet, most money managers still scoff at Bitcoin due to its volatility and regulatory uncertainty. A 2024 CoinShares survey found that nearly two-thirds (62%) of financial advisors believe recommending Bitcoin conflicts with their fiduciary duty. That may soon change because Bitcoin is becoming too significant to ignore. On a recent webinar, Cathie Wood called Bitcoin a promising new asset class that money managers now have “some fiduciary responsibility” to understand, even in its early stages. While the number of advisors actually allocating crypto to client portfolios remains small, it’s growing fast. The latest Bitwise and VettaFi survey found that 22% of financial advisors started allocating crypto in client accounts in the past year—twice the rate in 2023 and a record high for the poll. For context, that’s not far from gold. A recent Bank of America study found that 71% of U.S. financial advisors have little to no gold allocation, often keeping it below 1% of portfolios. Even BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — is making a case for Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier akin to gold as the traditional stock-bond correlation continues to break down. “The erratic correlation between stock and bond returns has defined the new regime — and government bonds have become a less reliable cushion against equity selloffs as a result,” BlackRock analysts wrote. “We see the potential for other diversifiers — old like gold and new like Bitcoin — to step in.” As of today, all crypto held by institutional investors — including Bitcoin in ETFs and brokers that allow digital asset trading — is stored with crypto-native firms rather than traditional banks. Coinbase dominates this space. Of the 11 SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, Coinbase serves as custodian for nine funds, controlling 86.4% of total ETF assets under management. That raises concentration risk, not to mention the fact that institutional investors remain wary of crypto-native firms, regardless of their size, given high-profile collapses like FTX and security breaches at firms like Bybit. To address this, Wall Street banks are stepping in to pick up the baton. Citi and State Street — the world’s second- and fourth-largest custodians — announced they will offer crypto custody services next year. This isn’t just another sign of crypto’s maturation. It’s also one of the biggest wins from recent regulatory shifts, including the revocation of SAB 121, a rule that forced banks to put digital assets on their balance sheets. Keeping assets off the balance sheet is what makes traditional asset custody safer and also more cost-effective. It reduces reserve requirements for custodians and lowers liquidation risk for asset owners if a custodian goes bust. “Asset managers have to put their assets with some sort of custodian, but with crypto, they do not currently have the ability to place large amounts in banks because of limitations like SAB 121,” according to a legal executive at a bank interviewed in an article by John Crabb for Institutional Investor. “If these limitations go away, asset managers will have more options — they could still use a non-bank custodian for crypto assets, but they would also have the choice of a chartered bank.” Another telltale sign of crypto’s evolution as an institutional asset is Wall Street’s willingness to become liquidity providers. Rumor has it that Citadel — the largest market maker on Wall Street — is preparing to enter the digital asset market. If true, it would be the first traditional market maker to provide liquidity in crypto. According to sources familiar with the matter, as first reported by Bloomberg, Citadel wants to join major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Crypto.com. This move follows Citadel’s 2023 initiative to bypass mainstream crypto exchanges — still deemed too risky for institutional investors due to regulatory uncertainty — and create its own institutional-grade crypto exchange. “Citadel Securities teamed up with brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, to form an institution-only crypto exchange that mirrors how assets are held and settled in stock and bond markets. That venue, EDX Markets, went live in 2023 and offers crypto trading exclusively for institutional investors,” wrote Katherine Doherty of Bloomberg. Out of fear of missing out, even the most conservative institutional investors are following suit. “Interestingly, several U.S. states are taking significant steps toward Bitcoin adoption, with pension funds in Michigan and Wisconsin already holding crypto, and Pennsylvania approving legislation to allocate up to 10% into Bitcoin,” Jason Yanowitz, a founder of Blockworks, told me. Wisconsin’s state pension fund recently doubled its Bitcoin ETF position to $320 million. Then there’s Michigan, with a $6.6 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs within its $143.9 million pension fund for state employees. Both allocations mark a significant share of their portfolios, substantially higher than BlackRock’s recommendation of a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. Endowments are also hopping on board. Last month, University of Austin announced a $5 million Bitcoin allocation within its $200 million endowment, marking the first dedicated crypto endowment fund in U.S. higher education. Sovereign wealth funds are hopping on the bandwagon, too. Just weeks ago, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, revealed a massive $437 million stake in Bitcoin. It’s now the seventh-largest investor in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF by assets. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) indirectly owned 2,446 BTC worth around $250 million at the end of the first half of 2024, more than double its holdings from the end of 2023. Then there’s the speculation about Trump’s Bitcoin national reserve. What Trump is proposing is similar to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has already introduced a bill suggesting the U.S. acquire 1,000,000 BTC over five years. It’s a long shot because buying Bitcoin means borrowing, which Trump is trying to avoid. What’s more likely is that he builds a de facto reserve out of the 200,000 BTC confiscated by the federal government, for which Trump signed an executive order last week. Any additional Bitcoin purchases would likely require congressional approval. Even a symbolic move — relabeling seized Bitcoin as a “reserve” — could spark what some economists call a global Bitcoin arms race, triggering another wave of institutional buying, only this time at the state level. No matter how big the push, Trump’s executive powers may not be enough to enact whatever he envisions, even if it’s as simple as reclassifying seized Bitcoin. Moish Peltz, a partner at Falcon Rappaport & Berkman, told CoinDesk after Trump’s victory that the rules surrounding seized Bitcoin might change on a department-by-department basis, depending on how it was confiscated. “Some portion of the seized Bitcoin might need an act of Congress, but not necessarily,” he said. “Trump’s pro-crypto stance has the potential to be a catalyst for transformation, but we need to separate the signal from the noise,” Yanowitz told me. “What the market needs to see moving forward is the administration continuing to push on the policy front.” Despite the uncertainty, the FOMO factor is already evident at the state level. There are already reports — though anecdotal — that other developed nations, including Japan, Russia and China, are actively considering to acquire Bitcoin ahead of a potential U.S. national reserve announcement. Meanwhile, while the Trump administration works on a federal Bitcoin reserve, 15 states — including Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida — are considering or have already introduced bills to add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming believes states will lead the way. “My bet is that you’ll see a state establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government,” she said at a recent conference hosted by crypto personality Anthony Pompliano in New York, as reported by Bloomberg. At the end of the day, it’s uncertain whether institutions will hold their ground in the face of a broader market sell-off. But one thing is clear: Big money is throwing its weight behind Bitcoin as something that’s here to stay.

Title: AVGO Stock To $100?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/10/avgo-stock-to-100/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. AVGO Stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered an impressive 9% stock price gain following an upbeat quarterly performance reported on March 6. The company’s performance was fueled by continued demand for its AI products. With the stock soaring 50% year-over-year and maintaining robust revenue growth averaging 24% over three years, Broadcom surely presents a compelling narrative. But, here’s the thing, in a downturn, AVGO can lose – no – there is evidence, from as recent as in 2022, that AVGO stock lost as much as 36% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio – and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings? While Broadcom's AI prospects remain promising, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. Risk Factors to Consider The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Concerning Performance Metrics Notably, AVGO stock has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent market downturns—a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today’s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) • AVGO stock fell 36.3% from a high of $67.09 on 4 January 2022 to $42.71 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $250.00 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $195 Covid Pandemic (2020) • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $31.57 on 19 February 2020 to $16.79 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In conclusion, while AVGO stock currently enjoys investor enthusiasm driven by significant AI sector expansion, it commands a premium valuation at 30x forward earnings. Consider that despite Broadcom’s impressive 44% revenue surge last year, projections indicate a decelerating growth trajectory—21% this year followed by 15% next year. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your AVGO stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $100, or even lower levels? Holding on a falling stock is not always easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset – a Boston area wealth manager, whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during 2008/2009 timeframe, when S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? See the last six market crashes compared.

March 10, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 28, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. Captioned Bray v. Rocket Lab USA, Inc., No. 25-cv-01733 (C.D. Cal.), the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit charges Rocket Lab as well as certain of Rocket Lab’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-rocket-lab-usa-inc-class-action-lawsuit-rklb.html You can also contact attorneys J.C.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Rocket Lab is a space company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (ii) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (iii) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (iv) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” that alleged, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Rocket Lab class action lawsuit.

Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a “period” of transition from the policy changes he’s making. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.21%) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA+4.48%) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will “burn” Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR+3.56%) stock also declined. Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure. Here are some stocks to watch today: Airbnb (ABNB-4.96%) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company’s durable growth and its addition of an “experiences” category. Bally’s (BALY+5.87%) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company’s shares. Cognizant (CTSH-1.27%) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm. Coinbase (COIN+7.18%) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported. Crowdstrike (CRWD+7.81%) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company’s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week. All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets. Doordash (DASH+3.33%) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company’s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices. IBM (IBM-2.53%) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR’s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn’t comment on the decision. Microchip Technology (MCHP-1.57%) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that’s been exacerbated by the chipmaker’s falling revenue and weak margins. Oracle (ORCL-3.29%) will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Monday. The software giant’s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth. Consensus estimates call for profit of $1.49 per share and revenue of $14.38 billion. The stock fell 4.6% in morning trading ahead of the report. Harri Weber contributed to this report.

Title: 7 Rewarding Career Paths for the Fearless Agile Program Manager

STARCIO drive digital transformation STARCIO The redesigned StarCIO blog formally names Social, Agile, and Transformation. Learn more. Agile program managers are one of the roles hit hardest in the monthly stories of tech layoffs. I computed this by reviewing a sample of the 2022-2023 tech layoffs by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. From this sample, 8.3% of 500 layoffs impacted program managers. I suspect that the risk is much higher for program managers who champion waterfall, top-down, or command-and-control methodologies. Forrester reports 61% of organizations have deployed agile methodologies over the past five years and waterfall continues to decline. One of my most popular articles from 2021 was about how to be an agile program manager. Watch the embedded video on five key responsibilities of successful agile program managers and developing an agile program manager office. There may be a need for a program manager role in large enterprises with multi-team agile. Who manages vendors, contracts, and reporting for agile release trains (ARTs), tribes, or scrum of scrums, etc.? For other organizations, agile program manager roles are declining, especially during times of layoffs and downsizing. Agile program manager may feel a little vulnerable and scared about where to take their career paths. If you are laid off, you must consider repositioning yourself above and beyond your agile knowledge and program management skills. One of the key lessons in Chapter 1 of Digital Trailblazer is key to agile program managers. “Step out of your comfort zone and broaden your perspective by seeking outside‐in learning opportunities.” This is what I mean by the fearless, agile program managers. They step out of their comfort zones and develop competencies beyond the leadership skills and agile collaboration competencies. Consider your skills and experiences leading large-scale agile initiatives as building blocks. Here are seven career paths for agile program managers. This career path is for the more technical program managers. They develop DevOps, SDLC, cloud architecture, and other technical skill sets. It requires a hard pivot into more technical responsibilities, like becoming an agile technical team lead or solutions architect. The combination of agile program manager and architecture experience can lead to agile delivery leader roles and, potentially, CTO opportunities. Agile program managers who work in a single industry and develop expertise around its business models, customer segments, and operations should consider pivoting into business leadership responsibilities. The key to getting these roles is developing relationships with business executives in the industry who recognize program management as a key skill set and will open the doors when new opportunities emerge. Invest time at industry-specific conferences and networking events. This is a common career path for companies embracing agile methodologies and recognizing they need more product managers and agile product owners but fewer program and project managers. However, this transition only works well when CIOs commit to product management and the agile program manager embraces the key differences between program and product management responsibilities. If you seek this career path, consider reading selections from my 12 books for product managers and developing design thinking skills. Agile program managers who successfully lead product initiatives, grow end-user adoption, and drive revenue growth can pursue chief digital officer opportunities. Agile program managers with a knack, interest, and passion for compliance functions have two potential career paths. For those with data skill sets and an interest in machine learning and AI, developing a strong understanding of proactive data governance and GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, and other regulations can pivot into data governance leadership roles. Expand the skillset to AI governance and add a certification in ISO 27001 or similar, and there’s the opportunity to become an organization’s chief data officer. Pivoting from program management to information security roles may be a less likely career path, but it is still plausible for those willing to invest in the technical acumen and gain CISSP or similar certifications. One opportunity for agile program managers is to take on roles reporting to the CISO, including that of SOC Director, GRC Director, or security awareness leader. This career path may feel like taking a step backward in responsibilities, but it’s an option for agile program managers looking for stability and career opportunities in larger enterprises. ITSM leaders typically come up the ranks from individual contributor roles, but larger enterprises benefit by having ITSM directors who have strong customer support skills, agile backgrounds, and business relationship-building experiences. This career path is also good for agile program managers who are metrics-driven and enjoy driving continuous operational improvements. I know several program managers who achieved Six Sigma Black Belt certifications and developed expertise in change management who went on to become department directors. The key is to focus on a specific department’s operations and challenges and the opportunities beyond operational functions, especially in sales and marketing. The biggest mistake I see program managers make is getting too comfortable in their roles and expecting new opportunities based solely on the size and success of the initiatives they lead. Some program managers may go on to lead agile PMOs or become the CIO’s chief of staff. For many others, program management is a step in the journey, not a career. Find your path. I’m here to help.

Title: Forbes Daily: Markets Rattled, But Trump Remains Resolute On Tariffs

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. For all of the advancements in modern fitness technology, one of the latest viral crazes is remarkably simple: a headband with a ball attached by a stretchy string. Boxbollen has received endorsements from celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Conor McGregor, Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg, a strategy that hasn’t been cheap—Boxbollen has reinvested as much as 50% of its revenue into its marketing. But it’s paid off: In 2024, the company posted $59.2 million in revenue, its best year yet. “The question is sustainability,” a retail analyst told Forbes. “[A] $50 million business can grow into something larger, or it could fade away. … It’s hard to know what a $50 million business looks like a decade out.” President Donald Trump gestures as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2025. President Donald Trump downplayed last week’s stock market drop in an interview Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” Last week featured a dizzying amount of tariff news, and Trump on Friday said he might impose reciprocal tariffs on some Canadian goods, despite previously delaying the 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods for a month. MORE: The uncertainty of tariffs weighed on markets, as the S&P 500 recorded its worst weekly loss since September, declining 3.1%. More than $3 trillion in market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its February 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data. Mark Carney will replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister, and was critical of President Donald Trump in his victory speech on Sunday night. Carney, an economist who previously served as the governor of both Canada and England’s central banks, won with nearly 86% of the Canadian Liberal Party’s leadership vote, and vowed to keep retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.” Cracks are starting to show in the labor market, as fewer jobs were added than expected last month, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in February, and government jobs fell by about 10,000, though the March report is more likely to be impacted by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts due to the timing of the February survey. William Lansing took over as CEO of credit scoring company FICO in 2012, when the business was still recovering from the financial crisis. In 13 years, he’s made a bundle for long-term shareholders and himself an almost-billionaire, largely by pushing through margin fattening price increases. The once secretive analytics company has become a consumer brand that anyone looking to finance a car or home obsesses over. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY APU GOMES/GETTY IMAGES; JAAP ARRIENS/NURPHOTO; WANG ZHAO/AFP; HANNES P ALBERT/PICTURE ALLIANCE Elon Musk claims Tesla is not an electric car maker, but rather an AI company that can become the most valuable in the world—thanks to the data it collects from its cars. In theory, it could help train vehicles to operate without human assistance, but that data isn’t necessarily as helpful as Musk claims: Training AI on videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle the most critical edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios. Federal investigators suspect that hackers of password manager LastPass caused one victim to lose XRP cryptocurrency that is now worth some $716 million, due to a massive spike in crypto values following the election of President Donald Trump. It’s already been a big year for massive crypto thefts, after hackers stole $1.5 billion from the ByBit exchange in February, in what was dubbed the biggest crypto heist in history. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and other insiders at Dominari Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed wealth management firm, acquired 1 million company shares through a private placement and bonuses—the day before it was announced that the Trump brothers would join its advisory board. The timing probably does not violate insider trading laws, experts told Forbes, but raises questions about whether directors acted in the company’s best interests by selling the shares cheaply to themselves. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday sent a letter to President Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and asked him to make his financial disclosures with the government public, days after Trump announced the creation of an American crypto strategic reserve. In her letter, Warren asked how Sacks intends to prevent “the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.” The latest casualty of DOGE’s work is Notify.gov, a federal system designed to send mass texts to the public, and it’s in imminent danger of shutting down, according to publicly-available proposed changes to its website. The tool is used by governments at all levels to send out important warnings and reminders to citizens, but sources tell Forbes most of the team that manages it have been “fired, transferred, or have resigned.” The CDC is planning to study potential connections between vaccines and autism, a link that has been pushed controversially by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures spreading the long-debunked theory for years, and health experts have widely condemned his stance. MORE: Health officials in Maryland reported a positive measles case in a resident who had traveled internationally last week, unrelated to outbreaks of the disease in Texas and New Mexico. Measles was announced as being eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, given the success of vaccines in eliminating the disease, though outbreaks of the virus have still popped up among the unvaccinated. President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering new “large-scale” sanctions and tariffs on Russia to compel an end the Russia-Ukraine war, but hours later, he said “it may be easier dealing with Russia” compared to Ukraine. The warnings contradict a Reuters report earlier last week that the White House was considering easing sanctions against Russia to improve relations as it works to negotiate a ceasefire and permanent end to the conflict. “One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.” TOPLINE Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares’ quest to sell what he considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand for nearly a decade. Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target, as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across grocery store soup aisles industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category. Despite its growth, Mares wants the company to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of independent board member Sam McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue.

MORE Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Retailers shed among the most jobs of any private-sector industry last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that could be just the tip of the iceberg: 6,300: The number of jobs the retail industry lost in February, second only to food services and drinking establishments, which lost 27,500 positions 19,000: The number of jobs cost from the bankruptcy of crafts retailer Joann, and another 16,000 jobs were lost from Party City Up to 15,000: The number of stores that retailers are expected to close this year, more than double the amount that closed in 2024 With all the talk of tariffs, layoffs and more, economic uncertainty is bound to cause stress. Focus on the things you can control: For instance, come up with a Plan B, like a side hustle to earn extra income. Exercise self-care and immerse yourself in the things that bring you joy, and don’t leave your financial situation up to chance—keep track of the money coming in and out.

Title: The Dow tanks as Trump won't rule out a recession. Nvidia and Tesla stock take a hit

Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street’s fears tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,” Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, “are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.” The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA+4.48%) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA+3.21%) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears. The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged. Goldman Sachs (GS+0.58%) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase. On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA-1.87%) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn’t rule it out as a potential outcome. “I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market’s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has “just become hooked” on government spending and that “there’s going to be a detox period.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn’t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn’t affect federal policy. —Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

Title: BlackRock: Texans are getting the retirement jitters as golden years loom

businessPersonal Finance By Javier E. DavidBusiness Editor Business Editor A growing number of Texans fear their golden years could turn to lead, with many feeling financially unprepared as retirement draws closer, BlackRock reported on Monday. In a new survey, the world’s largest asset manager found retirement security fears “consume” many in the Lone Star State. Out of about 500 respondents surveyed, BlackRock found that 78% are concerned that the system is leaving too many Americans without sufficient savings to live in old age. About 62% of Texans reported having under $150,000 in retirement savings, BlackRock said. Meanwhile, a slim 22% of employed Texans felt “very confident” in having enough money to last through retirement, the data showed, while nearly half are more concerned about going broke during their golden years than they are dying. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy BlackRock’s findings are consistent with a body of evidence showing widespread retirement insecurity, especially with the solvency of Social Security a big question mark as more depart the workforce. Costlier living expenses driven by inflation have exacerbated the problems. In a 2021 report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that Texas “has a high share of population groups that tend to struggle with retirement savings,” including low-wage workers, people of color (specifically Hispanics) and rural residents. The data suggests that Americans in general — and Texans in particular — “are not as prepared as they need to be for retirement,” the Dallas Fed’s researchers wrote. For those over 45, available figures show that average retirement account balances lag far behind levels considered comfortable enough to retire. BlackRock’s survey respondents felt $2.1 million was the magic number they’d need to live comfortably after retiring; however, not even 30% have personally stocked away enough to do so. The problem is growing more acute, as more Baby Boomers retire and the first wave of Generation X turns 60 in 2025 — with retirement not far off. According to Fidelity data, Baby Boomers are considered the most financially secure, with the average 401K balance at $249,000, with the average individual retirement account carrying a balance of about $257,000. But for Gen X, reality is starting to bite. The average 401K for that cohort is just over $192,000, according to Fidelity, with the average IRA barely over $100,000. BlackRock found that among the Texans they surveyed, Gen Xers were indeed the most anxious, with 60% having under $150K in retirement savings. Half of voters in Texas between the ages of 55 and 64 have under $50,000 saved for retirement, the firm noted.

“Everything is bad and will get worse” – Ukraine Serviceman to British Media By Ahmed Adel, March 09, 2025 Ukraine’s Armed Forces have lost the initiative on the battlefield, and even with the resumption of US military aid, the Ukrainians would have little chance of stopping the Russian army’s advances. More Guns, Less Butter: Starmer’s Defence Spending Splash By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, March 09, 2025 Spend, spend, spend is the theme, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shown himself willing to join this wasteful indulgence. On February 25, just prior to his visit to Washington, Starmer announced that spending on defence would reach 2.5% of GDP from April 2027. German Elections – With Some Highlights of President Trump’s State of the Union Address By Peter Koenig, March 09, 2025 On 23 February 2025 advanced elections were held in Germany towards a new Government, as the old Government coalition, the so-called “Traffic Light” – red (Social Democrats), yellow (Free Democratic Party), green (The Greens) – collapsed in early November 2024. This had been expected for some time. The advanced snap elections were no surprise. Recycling ‘Russiagate’ in Romania By Drago Bosnic, March 09, 2025 Romania has been going through unprecedented instability in the last several months, with the Brussels-run neoliberal dictatorship effectively taking over the country. It could even be described as a “soft coup” orchestrated to nullify the will of the Romanian people. Hamas, Palestine, and Israel By Dr. Vladislav B. Sotirović, March 09, 2025 In essence, any economic prosperity of Palestine directly depends on political relations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. The Israeli general embargoes are more or less constant and, therefore, limit the available natural resources and economic potentials to be properly used, causing starvation and dehumanization of the Palestinians. Agent Zelensky, Ukraine on Sale. Manlio Dinucci By Manlio Dinucci, March 09, 2025 In 2021 Zelensky, overwhelmed by huge economic problems, changed the law preventing the sale of Ukrainian land and resources to foreign companies. So it was that half of Ukraine’s precious black earths and mineral resources ended up in the hands of Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, controlled by big US funds including BlackRock, Vanguard and Blackstone. RFK Jr. and Federal Health Agencies Wisely Oppose Mass H5N1 Animal Vaccination Over Mutation Concerns By Nicolas Hulscher, March 09, 2025 America has public health leadership that uses common sense and the most up-to-date science. Mass animal depopulation for H5N1 bird flu prevents population immunity, while widespread vaccination would accelerate viral evolution—prolonging the crisis, destabilizing the food supply chain, and increasing the risk to humans.

Title: Walgreens heading down a very risky path | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Walgreens has been attempting a financial turnaround for years, and now it says it’s found a new path to finish it. But if history is any guide, its path is more likely to lead to its eventual demise than long-term success. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns drugstores in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and Thailand, announced last week that it would be ending a century as a publicly traded company, and would be sold to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Less than a decade ago it was America’s largest drugstore chain, and its stock was successful enough to replace iconic conglomerate General Electric in the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 companies selected for their importance to the economy and the overall market. But its shares have lost 83% of their value since that day, with a 71% plunge coming in just the last four years. And it would have lost more than that, if it wasn’t for investors looking ahead to the sale to Sycamore, which lifted shares more than 7% in Friday trading. Sycamore and Walgreens have both insisted the purchase will allow for the company, which has already closed many of its stores, to complete the turnaround more quickly. “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,” said Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth. “Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.” Related article Walgreens is going private in an up to $24 billion deal But despite the promise, retail’s graveyard is full of the bones of many once-dominant retailers who closed up shop after being bought by private equity firms. The list includes Toys R Us, Sports Authority and RadioShack — all once leaders in their fields. Even some companies that survived being taken private that survived, such as Aeropostale, did so only after a trip through bankruptcy court. Not all retailers taken private have failed. Some, such as Sycamore-owned Staples, continue to do well. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that this is the right solution, said Mark Cohen, the former head of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “Intellectually it sounds like a good idea to relieve a company of the quarter-to-quarter need to satisfy shareholders and instead focus on long-term success,” said Cohen. “But from a historical point of view, most of these deals result in the company circling the drain.” The private equity business model often relies upon forcing the company to take on massive amounts of debt to give the greatest possible return to the private equity firm, with the long-term survival of the business often not a priority. The debt is often used to pay “special dividends” to the firm itself to cover the initial purchase price, as well as heavy “management fees” placed on the company, to be paid to the private equity firm. Many times brick-and-mortar retail chains have been forced to sell off the buildings that house their stores and pay rents that they can’t afford to new owners, leading to even more store closings and layoffs. Neither Sycamore nor Walgreens had a comment when asked about the history of retailers closing after being taken private. As of last August, Walgreens had about 8,500 stores in the United States, and 3,700 foreign locations. That’s down by about 1,000 American stores and 1,000 foreign stores from where it stood when it joined the Dow in 2018. There are more store closings to come, as the company announced plans in October to shutter another 1,200 stores. Related article Walgreens admits locking up shampoo and toothpaste hurts sales. But it’s still doing it Walgreens itself was booted from the Dow a year ago and replaced by Amazon, which is providing its own growing competition with an online pharmacy. Walgreens has been passed by CVS as the nation’s largest drugstore chain. Both Walgreens and CVS and rival Rite-Aid have been struggling due to lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, hurting the pharmacy business in the back of the store, and growing competition not just from Amazon but from big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target, which often sell the same items as those in the front of stores. Whether or not Sycamore can fix the problems with Walgreens, it is likely to do well in the deal, considering it is getting the chain at a fraction of its former value and because of the way the deals are structured to benefit the private equity buyers, said Cohen. “The pathway to heaven is to fix the business and then take it public and make an enormous amount of money because you’re the shareholder,” Cohen said. But that’s not often the way things play out. “The typical pathway is to milk the business for as long as you can, then break it up and dispose of it,” Cohen added. The fundamental problems leading to the private equity purchase don’t go away with this deal, according to Cohen. “What is it about this transaction that is going to result in the recovery of this? In my opinion, nothing. Are they fundamentally going to be better able to compete with CVS or Amazon? No. Will they be able rationalize the behavior they’ve had to engage in of locking up toothpaste, rather than find some other way to protect their inventory, causing customers to run, not walk to Amazon? No,” he said. “The net of this is it’s just deck chairs on the Titanic being moved around.” CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: ‘Panic-Selling’ Could Be About To Crash The Bitcoin Price

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”

March 10, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 10 March 2025 – Today, Novo Nordisk announced headline results from REDEFINE 2, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 2 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to placebo. The trial included 1,206 randomised people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes and a mean baseline body weight of 102 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 2 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 61.9% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 15.7% after 68 weeks compared to 3.1% with placebo. Weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks was a co-primary endpoint and was achieved by 89.7% of patients on CagriSema, compared to 30.3% by placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 13.7% compared to 3.4% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “The REDEFINE 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes”, said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. The detailed results from REDEFINE 1 and REDEFINE 2 will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. The phase 3 trial programme includes: REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,417 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – an 84-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

Title: German Elections – With Some Highlights of President Trump’s State of the Union Address

See original: Germany Voted a New Government – What Will Change? By Peter Koenig, February 24, 2025 . On 23 February 2025 advanced elections were held in Germany towards a new Government, as the old Government coalition, the so-called “Traffic Light” – red (Social Democrats), yellow (Free Democratic Party), green (The Greens) – collapsed in early November 2024. This had been expected for some time. The advanced snap elections were no surprise. What came across for many – but not for all — as a surprise was the result of these snap elections. As was expected, the center-right CDU/CSU came out ahead with 28%, considerably less than they expected – they hoped for more than 30%. Second was the relatively new party (founded in 2013) Alternative for Germany (AfD – German acronym) with about 21%. Exit polls apparently indicated that about two-thirds of Germans prefer the values AfD stands for, as compared to those of the broken “traffic light” coalition. Former East Germany voted almost exclusively AfD. AfD is said to be a right-wing party. However, all things considered with reason, AfD is a common sense party, standing for national sovereignty, controlled immigration, anti-war, thus anti-NATO, and possibly considering DEXIT – meaning leaving the European Union, as well as the Euro, for more monetary sovereignty. AfD vouches also for renewed cooperation with Russia, which is a MUST, not just to revive Germany’s economy but to make Europe independent again, with a sovereign track, being able to freely choose her partners not just following the shifting dictate of the United States, and worldwide appearing as a weak vassal of Washington’s. In terms of parliamentary seats (total 630), the result was even stronger for AfD. The winning party CDU/CSU (symbolic color black) will have 208 seats, and the runner up, AfD (blue) has 158 seats, together 360 seats. As a coalition, they would have more than secure absolute majority which is 316. However, and this is where German Un-Reason comes to play, under the mandate of Olaf Scholz, the defunct chancellor, all parties pledged, they would not enter a coalition with AfD under any circumstances because they considered AfD a neo-Nazi party. AfD has been “stonewalled”, as they call it. Germany also pledged they would continue supporting Ukraine’s war against Russia, no matter what Presidents Trump-Putin negotiations come up with. They feel offended and side-kicked for not having been invited to the negotiations. Chancellor Scholz even attempted to forbid the AfD as a party. It did not fly. But how undemocratic! As JD Vance, US Vice President, pointedly said at the Munich Security Conference on 14 February. Prohibiting the second largest party would be an absolute nonsense; just because AfD does not follow the then US President Biden (US neoliberal globalist Democrats) mandate. As if the US would have to set the tone to which Europe may dance. As an anecdote, President Trump congratulated Alice Weidel, co-founder and front person of the AfD party, for her party’s excellent election results. So, the Washington wind has shifted perhaps by as much as 180 degrees. How do “puppets”, 27 of them dis-united under the EU, react? It is an unspoken and unwritten fact that at least half of the EU members would want to share AfD values, however they do not dare say so, except for Viktor Orban from Hungary. They feel too weak to express their opinions, lest they might be punished or sanctioned by the ever-more tyrannical EU leadership. * The likely Chancellor to be, Friedrich Merz, a former executive of BlackRock Germany, leader of the CDU/CSU party, must therefore avoid the “stonewalled” party and start coalition negotiations with the third party, the Social Democrats, Scholz’s party. This may be extremely difficult as ideologically they are far apart. CDU/CSU are much closer to AfD in strategic thinking. In a CDU/CSU-SP alliance, lots on concessions might be needed on both sides. Even if they are willing to make these concessions for the sake of the coalition, nobody knows how long the compromise will last before there will be rifts appearing – and the coalition may fall apart again. Many analysts predict a repeat early election, as they may not even come to an agreement within the next couple of months during which time a new Government should be in place. The target for Mr. Merz is early April, the deadline is more likely early May 2025. For example, one key issue between the two coalition partners-to-be is immigration. Throughout the campaign, Merz and his party talked about controlled immigration. Whereas the Socialists want to keep the doors wide open, à la Joe Biden USA, not even thinking of adjusting it to the new US Administration. In a recent speech, Merz said and repeated, “Here nobody speaks of “controlled Immigration. Our borders are and remain open.” Here we go: first concession! Will it last? Mr. Merz said already in strong terms that he wants an independent Germany and Europe, distancing the bloc from the Trump-USA. This would parallel the fiercely anti-US drive of the unelected EU leadership; the typical deceptive game of the other side of the same coin, a rather primitive approach of Klaus Schwab’s WEF which itself is just a puppet for the forces behind it. Rumors have it, though informally and insinuating confirmed by President Trump’s brilliant State of the Union Address tonight, that he will invite Chancellor-to-be Merz to the White House in the not-too-distant future as he did with France’s Macron ten days ago. Macron may still be nominally pro-Europe, pro-Ukraine war and pro-NATO but since his surreptitious visit to the White Hose, he remains just a lame duck leader of the Big Ones in Europe. Mr. Trump had a conciliatory tone for Europe, calling them friends. Although this may be purely strategic, since Trump wants Europe on his side for rebuilding ties with Russia. Europe will eventually go along because “alone” between the Atlantic Ocean and the great contiguous Eurasian Continent, life might become mighty hard. Conciliatory also in more ways than one. When Mr. Trump was talking about tariffs during his State of the Union speech, he was no longer throwing around these insane rates of 25%, 50% or 100%, but assured the world that tariffs will be reciprocal which sounds like a fair deal. That must be a relief for Europe’s struggling economies. A couple of days ago, Trump also hinted at completing the second phase Nord Stream pipeline [the one that was not blown up, but was never finished], so that Russian gas could again flow to economically wrecked Europe, especially Germany which badly needs cheap energy to revamp her economy. At first, the German Government childishly under false loyalty to the dying Biden-globalists may refuse. But business and industrial pressure will either overturn a resisting government or bring them to reason. On another breaking news, President Trump announced tonight that just before his State of the Union message, he had received a conciliatory letter from Ukraine President Zelensky, telling him he wants Peace and that he wants him, President Trump, to negotiate Peace. This adds a new dimension in the European defiant resistance to Peace. Once Germany calls the tune, the rest of Europe, including the bloc, if by then it had survived, will follow the new trend of a new US of A – which very likely will want a more sovereign Europe, or sovereign European countries, as partners. With Ukraine declaring they want Peace, no longer war, ambitious Merz, rather than risk a re-election and losing, especially after his visit to Washington, where Trump will receive him probably with positive words for AfD, may reconsider breaking the “stonewall” and may be seeking, after all, a coalition with AfD. These predictions are just that, speculations blowing in the wind. In these chaotic days, we must be prepared that our ideas and forward-looking wishes might be overthrown in the glimpse of a second – as counter-chaos may enter the stage anytime. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Agent Zelensky, Ukraine on Sale. Manlio Dinucci

Time Published: 2025-03-09T20:28:27Z

In 2021 Zelensky, overwhelmed by huge economic problems, changed the law preventing the sale of Ukrainian land and resources to foreign companies. So it was that half of Ukraine’s precious black earths and mineral resources ended up in the hands of Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, controlled by big US funds including BlackRock, Vanguard and Blackstone. We talked about this a year ago on Grandangolo about Scott Ritter’s investigation “Agent Zelensky?”. Scott Ritter, a career US Marine and intelligence specialist, demonstrated intellectual honesty and courage when, as the head of UN inspectors in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, he concluded that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and publicly opposed the 2003 war. His investigative documentary shows the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens. “His puppet masters provided him with a financial cushion” with an initial payment of $41 million. He shows the luxurious villas Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), Israel, Italy in Forte dei Marmi, London, Georgia, Greece and even Crimea (the only bad investment because now Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also demolishes the false narrative that Russia is destroying Ukrainian grain and thus starving Africa. The reality is that Cargill and other multinational agribusinesses are seizing the best Ukrainian land and using the grain produced here for their own strategies. This is part of the US plan to reduce Europe’s food security in order to better control the allied countries themselves. Ukraine – the investigation shows – is not only being robbed of its land, sold by Zelensky and Co. to the multi-nationals, but is also becoming increasingly indebted. The huge military supplies it receives from the US and European superpowers are not given away, but on credit. Ukraine has already accumulated a foreign debt that would take centuries to repay. This debt will grow with the ‘reconstruction’ that Zelensky has put in the hands of the US-based BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. Investigation – not only is it being robbed of its land, sold off to multinationals by Zelensky and his associates, but it is also being plunged further and further into debt. The huge military supplies it receives from the US and the European superpowers are not given away, but given on credit. Ukraine has already accumulated a foreign debt that would take centuries to pay off. This debt will grow with the ‘reconstruction’ that Zelensky has entrusted to the US-based BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: IBIT Vs. FBTC: Which Bitcoin ETF Is The Better Buy?

Time Published: 2025-03-09T19:00:00Z

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut , Contributor. Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio. Bitcoin Spot ETFs have emerged as a leading way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, which has delivered tremendous returns since its launch in 2009. In 2024, the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allowing retail and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency on stock exchanges alongside other assets like the best stocks for 2025. In this article, you’ll learn the key differences between the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), how they compare in terms of fees, performance, management and security. While these bitcoin ETFs may not be right for some investors like the risk-averse or those who wish to hold bitcoin directly, they can provide exposure to an exciting asset which is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption. Investors may wish to invest in bitcoin in the first place, because of its strong performance, returning 47,116.2%% over the last 10 years and 997.9%% over the last 5 years. Depending on who you ask, bitcoin can serve as a promising speculative asset, an alternative store of value to the fiat currency like gold or a currency as it can serve as a means of exchange. A bitcoin ETF is most suitable for investors who wish to gain exposure to bitcoin as a speculative asset, earning a potential return from the asset’s growth. Bitcoin Spot ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allow investors to invest in bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to store bitcoin assets themselves. These ETFs provide liquidity, regulatory oversight, and simple trading alongside stocks, bonds and other funds in your portfolio. For investors who only wish to invest in bitcoin and not in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana from their existing brokerage account, bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are a good solution, rather than a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase. IBIT and FBTC both track the price movements of bitcoin but with differences in fees, how they’re structured, and their providers. Both of these bitcoin ETFs trade on the major stock exchanges like NYSE, allowing broad access to retail investors and institutional investors. IBIT is a bitcoin ETF managed by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with $11.6 trillion under management. This ETF provides direct exposure to bitcoin price movements by holding bitcoin against its shares. BlackRock has a strong reputation of successful fund management with many established relationships across the global financial world, lending credibility to its bitcoin ETF. FBTC is a bitcoin ETF managed by Fidelity, another major asset manager with $5.8 trillion under management. Like IBIT, FBTC directly holds bitcoin against its shares, ensuring close price tracking of bitcoin. Fidelity is a commonly used asset manager by retail investors while BlackRock attracts more institutional investors. Fidelity has a long track record of engagement with cryptocurrency tracing back to 2014 when the firm began researching digital assets like bitcoin and blockchain technology. Both IBIT and FBTC closely track the price of bitcoin as they hold bitcoin against shares. FBTC’s 1-year return slightly outperformed IBIT with FBTC returning 137.65% vs 137.32% but investors will likely earn comparable returns going forward. Future performance is dependent on the price movements of bitcoin and effective custody of bitcoin for both ETFs by their managers. Both IBIT and FBTC hold bitcoin against their shares and closely track the price movements of bitcoin. The core holdings of IBIT and FBTC are identical as both are entirely invested in bitcoin. Slight differences may emerge based on fund management and liquidity. Bitcoin is not an income generating asset like a bond or dividend-earning stock and neither IBIT or FBTC offer dividend yield to investors. Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are best suited to investors who wish to gain a return from capital appreciation rather than dividend yield. Bitcoin is a speculative asset which can experience wild swings in price that retail investors may not be used to from traditional investing. For example, in February 2025, bitcoin experienced a 17% drop in value, followed by a 10% rally in March spurred on by speculation regarding a U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve. If the U.S. government invested in bitcoin through a strategic reserve, it would further shore up institutional adoption of the asset. The launch of bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC in 2024 increased adoption of bitcoin by allowing retail and institutional investors to more easily invest in the cryptocurrency alongside major assets like the best ETFs on exchanges. Public companies can also add bitcoin to their balance sheet as Microstrategy notably has as well as asset managers who wish to add bitcoin to their portfolio. With increased regulatory clarity by the SEC, more investors may feel comfortable investing in bitcoin, increasing its market cap and price. As mentioned, bitcoin is a volatile asset and both IBIT and FBTC can swing in price based on breaking news or market sentiment. Although regulatory clarity regarding bitcoin seems to be increasing, there is always the risk of adverse regulatory decisions affecting the price or availability of the asset in different markets. A risk which could potentially affect an ETF like IBIT or FBTC is a custody issue of bitcoin, like a hack or mismanagement of assets. As with any investment, investors should weigh their risk tolerance before investing in a bitcoin ETF like IBIT or FBTC. A good rule of thumb for bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin generally is to not invest an amount you would lose sleep over losing the entirety of. Bitcoin ETFs are subject to both short and long-term capital gains tax just like direct holding of bitcoin. One difference from a tax perspective is that bitcoin ETFs can be easily invested in through a traditional or Roth IRA, unlike direct holding of bitcoin. This can increase the tax efficiency of bitcoin investment as you may be able to defer taxes on bitcoin gains with a traditional IRA or not pay tax on these gains at all with a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax professional with cryptocurrency expertise if you’re concerned with the tax implications of investing in bitcoin ETFs. While IBIT and FBTC offer comparable bitcoin Spot ETFs, these ETFs differ based on expense ratios, asset manager strengths, and custody strategies. IBIT may be better suited for investors who wish to track the price movements of bitcoin with a lower expense ratio of 0.12%, all managed by the largest asset manager in the world with strong institutional support. FBTC may be preferred by investors who don’t mind a slightly higher expense ratio in exchange for Fidelity’s self-custody model and a decade-long track record of cryptocurrency expertise. Investors should further research both firm’s security protocols for custody as well as considering alternative bitcoin Spot ETFs and holding cryptocurrency directly as an alternative. Bottom Line IBIT and FBTC are very similar ETFs. They track the same asset and both are effective means for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin at low expense ratios from established asset managers. The ultimate decision of which ETF to choose for your portfolio comes down to reputation, minor expense ratio and performance differences, and the approach by which each firm custodies their bitcoin. Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio. Rapid spikes and falls in price are an inevitability but since its inception, it has outperformed major indexes like the S&P 500. The launch of IBIT and FBTC through BlackRock and Fidelity respectively demonstrates mainstream interest and adoption by the financial services, providing the possibility for stellar returns to a greater number of investors.

ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

Choose your location By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Hey, guys. So I’m noticing egg prices are still super high and the stock market has been dropping kind of fast and inflation is up and thousands of federal workers are getting laid off. But you know what? In moments like this, I find solace in one thing: The billionaires are going to be just fine. President Donald Trump did say that he’d fix high food prices on Day 1 , and that everything was going to get better immediately. And now he and other people in his administration are using words like “ pain ,” “ disturbance ” and “ detox period .” I don’t really like those words, but I don’t think they will impact important people like Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, who all stood behind Trump during his inauguration when he said : “The Golden Age of America begins right now.” I guess “right now” isn’t exactly “right now” for us, but perhaps the billionaires get to enter the Golden Age first, which seems only fair. Opinion: Tariffs? Not on that! (Yet.) You're fired! Oops, you're rehired. Trump is all chaos. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about Trump’s recent tariffs and the trade war they’ve launched and said: “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” I wondered for a moment if he had ever visited America, but then I realized he was probably talking about billionaires who historically have not had to worry about cheap goods, unless a sharply discounted private island counts as one. So while I, personally, am in favor of cheap goods, as they allow me to spend less money to continue living, I totally understand why the American dream of the wealthy will be unfazed by tariffs. Prices are bound to increase for U.S. consumers , but the rich can endure a Wagyu beef bump just fine, and the rest of us already know how to stretch a box of mac and cheese out over several days anyway. That brings me comfort as I travel to the grocery store to purchase one egg with my weekly wages. Bessent then told CNBC on Friday that all the things Trump and Musk are doing to the federal government – which appears to be mainly firing people and flipping the “TARIFFS” switch on and off over and over again – might put the economy through a “ detox period .” “There’s an adjustment,” The Treasury chief said . “We’ll see whether there’s pain.” OK. My preference would be for there to not be pain, but I do rest easy knowing that Bessent, who according to The New York Times has assets and investments “worth in excess of $700 million,” will not feel that pain the same way you or I might. I simply hate it when stratospherically rich people feel pain. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday told Fox News that regular Americans shouldn’t worry about things like price increases or the S&P 500 having its worst week in months : “We're transitioning from Bidenomics and the terrible economy that was delivered by the last administration. It takes a while to turn that ship around.” You see, transitioning from 50 straight months of job growth , the second best market returns for a presidential term since 1945 and factory construction hitting its highest point in over 50 years is going to take some time. President Joe Biden had to fix the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, so it only makes sense Republicans and their billionaire assistants will need time to take it apart and make it work better for them. A Times headline Friday read: “Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook.” Per that story: “Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data . And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. "Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession.” Opinion: Trump's speech was all about dodging responsibility for the economy he's crashing Now it might sound bad when you put all those words in one place, but remember, if you’re a billionaire, everything’s probably going to work out great. For the rest of us, there will apparently be some pain, some disturbance and some detoxing. But I imagine we deserve that for not being uber-rich. Rather than look at my glass as half-empty, I prefer to look at the glasses of billionaires as overflowing onto the floor, and then being mopped up by servants whose glasses are all-the-way empty.

What we need to focus on as we stand in the unemployment line or put off retirement for a few years or trade our least-productive child for a carton of expired eggs is that Musk and Bezos and Zuckerberg and Trump are on solid footing with nothing to worry about. Don’t be discouraged by our current Golden Age. I’m sure the billionaires the president is helping get billionaire-ier are living their best lives on our behalf, and they’ll welcome us in soon, or possibly never.

Title: Will The Growth Scare And Tariffs Continue To Sink Stocks?

[+] The Magnificent 7 has retreated by almost 16% since mid-December. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Performance The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time. The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case. Estimated First Quarter U.S. Economic Growth Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth. The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%. Monthly Job Growth The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again. The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn. Initial Jobless Claims The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession. Consumer Sentiment Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of former President Joe Biden’s term. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies. Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating. The February consumer inflation release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome. Consumer Inflation Estimate Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt. While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio. S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. Warren Buffett’s recent annual letter did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”

Published: March 07, 2025 Yet companies keep using them over and over. In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center upended American travel, layoffs rippled through the airline industry. By late September, ~81k jobs had been cut industry-wide. Nearly everyone made cuts, from bargain carriers like Frontier and Spirit to heavyweights like American, US Airways, and United, which each laid off between 15%-23% of their workers. The lone holdout was Southwest Airlines. It delayed purchases of new planes and nixed a renovation of its corporate headquarters, but it didn’t enact layoffs. Co-founder and former CEO Herb Kelleher saw them as anathema for a successful company. “Nothing kills your company’s culture like layoffs,” Kelleher once said. If that’s true, then company culture has experienced an economy-wide massacre in recent years: Even Southwest joined the club, announcing mass layoffs for the first time in over 50 years in February. Kelleher wasn’t around to see them. He died in 2019. Herb Kelleher addresses stockholders. (David Woo/Corbis via Getty Images) Research has consistently shown he was right about layoffs: They’re damaging to companies — especially when done for cost-cutting purposes; they’re damaging to laid off employees, who’ve seen higher rates of suicide in the aftermath of layoffs; and they’re damaging to the employees who keep their jobs. So why do companies keep doing them? Once upon a time, US businesses had far more people who thought like Herb Kelleher. In the middle of the 20th century, as America entered an era of unprecedented prosperity, influential companies practiced a form of capitalism that balanced profits with employee welfare and the public good. Seasonal employees got axed at times, but mass layoffs were relatively rare, as workers routinely stayed at a single company for much of their career. Things changed starting around the 1980s. As companies sought to rebound from a nationwide economic funk, they began practicing a more rough-and-tumble capitalism that prized shareholder value and ushered in a “free agent” model of employment. Celebrity CEOs like “Neutron” Jack Welch and “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap popularized a style of management predicated on reducing costs to produce short-term profits. Clockwise from left: Chainsaw Al Dunlap, Elon Musk with chainsaw, Neutron Jack Welch. (John Pineda/Hulton Archive via Getty Images, Valerie Plesch/Washington Post via Getty Images, Thomas Lohne/DDP/AFP via Getty Images) One of their favorite tools was mass layoffs. Welch, who ran General Electric, laid off more than 100k employees during his 20-year tenure. Every fiscal year, he’d rank workers and slash the bottom 10%. Dunlap’s strategy was to cut quickly and deeply — and ask questions later. “My philosophy is to err on the side of too much,” Dunlap wrote in his memoir, Mean Business. “Too many asset sales. Too many layoffs.” Plenty of corporations followed their example: Olivia Heller/The Hustle “All of a sudden,” David Gelles, author of the Welch biography The Man Who Broke Capitalism, told NPR, “other CEOs saw that…if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that.” That ethos remains today. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 1.5m-2m Americans are typically laid off or discharged every month, a number that increases during recessions. But the belief that company earnings and stock prices increase through layoffs typically doesn’t match reality. At best, research indicates that companies that lay off employees, on average, don’t see a better financial payoff in the long term compared to companies with a stable employment base. And they often fare worse. There are findings that suggest layoffs lead to both short-term and long term issues, including: Even during bad economies, when layoffs are rampant and often more justified, the results are similar — and that’s according to Bain & Company, which, ironically, consults for firms that make cuts. After the early-2000s dotcom bust, Bain researchers found that stock prices for S&P 500 companies that had no layoffs or laid off less than 3% of their workforce increased an average of 9% in the next year. Meanwhile, stock prices were flat in companies that laid off between 3%-10% of their workers, and prices plummeted 38% for companies that laid off more than 10%. Laid off tech workers network at a “Pink Slip Party” in San Francisco after the dotcom bust in 2001. (David McNew/Newsmakers via Getty Images) Some of these issues stem from the fact that a company that does layoffs is typically in distressed shape already. But experts have found several other reasons for why layoffs lead to negative results: As they recruit, these companies often find their reputation has been damaged among potential applicants, says Wayne Cascio, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who’s researched layoffs for decades. “If they have two offers and one is with a company that just had layoffs last year and another one is with a company that hasn’t had layoffs, which one are you going to pick?” Plus, the employees who survive layoffs grow discontent with the company and burn out faster as they handle more tasks, Cascio adds, leading to expensive voluntary worker exits. Layoffs don’t always portend future problems: Companies who enact them as part of a broader change in strategy, Cascio says, fare better than those who enact them simply to cut costs. It’s also true that recent layoffs among some tech brands have been accompanied by positive reactions from investors: Some tech layoffs fit into a category that Cascio describes as proactive downsizing. The companies were relatively healthy but realized they’d hired too much during the pandemic or saw signs of struggles down the road that they believed they could avoid with restructuring. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, says Jeffrey Pfeffer, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor and expert on organizational behavior, “the tech layoffs make no sense to me.” He attributes some of them to a contagion effect that led to companies enacting layoffs simply because everyone else did it. And if overhiring or underperformance was the true problem, Pfeffer says the companies should question their leaders, who green-lit the overhiring and may have failed to develop productive roles for their employees. “You could blame the workforce,” he says, “or the managers and leaders who are leading that workforce.” Some companies clearly trust management over the workforce. After a layoffs announcement last month, Meta doubled the potential amount of bonuses its executives can receive this year. So, what are the best alternatives to layoffs? As Southwest Airlines showed in 2001, companies can reduce expenses by delaying purchases and investments, cutting in places that don’t lead to job losses. If that’s not enough, Wayne Cascio says companies should attempt to reduce hours or initiate furloughs (a temporary unpaid leave of absence) rather than layoffs. His research has shown that, even if layoffs occur, companies that try these alternatives perform better than those who instantly lay off employees when faced with financial problems. At least during the pandemic, many companies showed a willingness to delay or resist layoffs. Cascio says that a survey from the Society for Human Resources Management found that a majority of firms enacted furloughs or cut travel and employee perks before laying off workers. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, as the last few years have shown, layoffs are happening — and often without any signs that they’re indicative of larger strategic moves. The problem, Cascio says, is that there are only two ways to make money in business: growing revenues or cutting costs. Slashing costs is a far more predictable way to ensure future growth than finding new ways to generate revenue. And, too often, companies do the predictable thing. Pfeffer was reminded of this impulse on a recent flight when he got upgraded to first class and ended up next to an airline executive. The industry had used buyouts and layoffs to shrink staff sizes during the pandemic and faced difficulties in refilling positions when demand picked up. Pfeffer told the executive the layoffs had been a terrible idea. Then he asked him if his airline had gotten rid of any airplanes when business was down. The executive said it had not. “So why,” Pfeffer says, “get rid of employees?” Get the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop. Want even more business resources?

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

The latest reports on inflation, jobs, and consumer sentiment could be in the spotlight this week, with Wednesday's release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) offering a key update on price pressures in February. Investors will also be watching for scheduled earnings reports from tech giants Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). Results from several retailers, including Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), and Dollar General (DG), could offer a look at retail sales amid worries about tariffs and consumer confidence. Monday, March 10 Tuesday, March 11 Wednesday, March 12 Thursday, March 13 Friday, March 14 Fresh inflation figures due this week are expected to offer a look at how prices performed in February, the first full month of data under the administration of President Donald Trump since his reelection. The CPI release on Wednesday follows other recent inflation reports showing price pressures easing somewhat, though the January CPI reading ticked higher. The data could be key for Federal Reserve officials, who have said they are closely watching pricing data as they evaluate interest rate levels. Other inflation-related indicators scheduled for this week include wholesale pricing data Thursday with the Producer Price Index. The scheduled Friday release of March consumer sentiment data tracks consumer expectations of inflation, an indicator also followed by Fed officials. The University of Michigan's sentiment survey comes after recent reports have shown U.S. consumers are beginning to lose confidence in the economy amid tariff uncertainty and job loss fears. The NFIB small business sentiment survey scheduled for release Tuesday could also provide insights on how small businesses are evaluating economic conditions. Tech giant Oracle is set to kick off the week's earnings on Monday, with analysts expecting rising revenue and profit after disappointing sales in the prior quarter. Oracle’s report comes as the cloud software provider joined a $500 billion joint venture with OpenAI and other tech firms to help build out AI infrastructure. Creative software leader Adobe is expected to follow Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching for signs its AI efforts are paying off, after reporting lower-than-expected revenue in the prior quarter and offering an underwhelming sales outlook. Retailers will also be in focus with several chains scheduled to report this week, including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s, Ulta Beauty, Casey's General Stores, and Dollar General. The results come as market participants watch for the impact of shifting trade policies and waning consumer confidence. CoreWeave, a cloud computing company backed by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), could also go public as soon as this week, in what is expected to be one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years.

For years, the internet has been shrinking. Not in size, not in data, but in ownership. A vast, decentralized network of personal blogs, forums, and independent communities has been corralled into a handful of paved prison yards controlled by a few massive corporations. Every post, every “friend,” every creative work—locked behind closed doors, and you don’t have the keys. The fediverse is a jailbreak. It’s not a product, not a single platform, it’s not something you can buy stock in or use to enrich yourself at the cost of our shared humanity. It’s a network of independent, interconnected social platforms, all running on open protocols like ActivityPub. It’s an ecosystem where you - not some incellionaire obsessed with eugenics - own your digital identity. Where your social graph belongs to you, not an algorithm’s shifting fucking whims. Where moving from one service to another doesn’t mean losing everything you’ve built and everything you’ve ever said. We’ve been trained to believe that the way things are is the way they have to be. That Meta, Google, and whatever the hell Twitter is calling itself today are the price of admission to digital society. That you can’t have discovery without algorithmic engineering. That the internet was supposed to become a shopping mall where every interaction is measured in ad revenue. But none of this was inevitable. It was built this way—on purpose. And the fediverse offers something else: freedom. This isn’t a utopian fantasy. It’s not a pipe dream, like web3’s non-existent decentralization. It already exists. Mastodon, Pixelfed, Lemmy, PeerTube, BookWyrm—these are real platforms, these are real people, these are real conversations. The problem isn’t that the fediverse isn’t viable. The problem isn’t that it’s “too complicated.” The problem is that the giants of Silicon Valley have spent 20 years convincing us that anything outside their control isn’t worth our time. And that’s just not bloody true. We’ve all seen what happens when social media platforms treat users as a commodity rather than a community. Creators who built entire careers on centralized platforms, only to see their reach strangled and manipulated by "bonus" programs and algorithms. Friends and networks erased overnight by corporate priorities and billionaire egos. Whole communities forced into digital exile because they didn’t fit the new monetization strategy. The fediverse is an escape from that cycle. It’s digital self-determination. The fediverse won’t succeed just because it’s better. It will succeed if and only if people choose it. If they reject the idea that being trapped in someone else’s ecosystem is just the cost of existing online. If they stop believing that “free” means surrendering ownership of your own connections, your own history, your own data. If they see that the internet wasn’t built to be a factory for engagement metrics and AI-generated content farms. It was built to connect us, not silo us to pad a wealth-extremist’s bank account. We don’t need billionaires. And we sure as shit don't need their vision for the future of our web. We need our vision. The fediverse isn’t a distant dream—it’s here, right now, waiting for you to step outside the walls and see what’s possible. The internet was meant to belong to everyone. And it still fucking can. Fuck it man. Just put on some Grateful Dead. Put on some Aretha. Print some kind of zine. Paint a sign. Start a band. Write a manifesto. Bootleg a t-shirt. Hand out stickers. Throw a party. Keep it weird. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 cast a long shadow. France, humiliated and burning for revenge. Germany, rising and certain it had to strike first to stay on top. Every decision, every alliance, every military maneuver was shaped by one core belief: another war wasn’t just possible—it was inevitable. We curate ourselves into something safe. We smooth out our rough edges. We keep things palatable, we stay detached, we’re less invested, we’re dedicated to avoiding embarrassment at all costs. That’s the mantra. Be cool. Be aloof. Don’t try too hard. Don’t try at all. A blog about stuff

Title: Jamaican tech workers targeted by recruiters, attracting high salaries
URL: https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20250309/jamaican-tech-workers-targeted-recruiters-attracting-high-salaries
Time Published: 2025-03-09T05:20:53Z

A United States-based fintech firm is currently recruiting at least 20 software engineers for a project here in Jamaica that will see them earning a starting salary of $10 million per year. But insiders in the tech sector say it is not unusual for foreign companies to scout local talent, some of whom migrate to take up positions elsewhere, while others work remotely here in Jamaica. Intellibus, described as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States and which is at the forefront of artificial intelligence and platform engineering, is looking for about 20 to 25 tech graduates to create a hub in Jamaica to service its clients in the US. To find the right persons, the company is organising a hackathon in which groups of students and potential employees will collaborate in solving problems, using coding to test their suitability to join the Intellibus team. “We know of the BPO sector, which hires 60,000 people, but the question is, how do we create a robust software sector, which requires a higher level of productivity and where employees can demand higher pay. For the Jamaican economy to really be transformed, the conversation must be, how do we boost the economy to the next level through productivity through the service sector?” Aditya ‘Ed’ Watal, founder and principal of Intellibus, told the Financial Gleaner. The India-born Watal spoke on the impact of AI on the job market at the Jamaica Stock Exchange’s Regional Investments & Capital Markets Conference in January, and returned a few weeks later to set up his Jamaican project. Watal said his company usually employs only one per cent of the persons interviewed, but said the bar had to be lowered for the Jamaican operation, meaning, about 500 persons will be interviewed. “I am trying to run an experiment that says, can I hire 20 people who are able to do similar jobs to the people that I have in the US today, are those people available and can I find them quickly enough?” Watal said. The entrepreneur said, based on his research, software engineers in Jamaica have a starting salary of US$35,000 per year (about $5.5 million). He said Intellibus is willing to pay about $10 million per year. A software developer with more than 30 years in business confirmed that only persons with a master’s degree and at least 10 years’ experience would normally command a $10-million salary. Watal said a similar project he tried in Cyprus, a member country of the European Union, was unsuccessful, but he believes it will be different in Jamaica. “We tried an experiment like this in Cyprus, but we did not scale it because, geographically, it was too far, and the economic advantage was also not as much. We weren’t getting a huge price break, because (Cyprus) is still part of the EU,” he said. Watal said in the US, his company has to pay top dollar for talent to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. Meanwhile, technology consultant Christopher Reckord told the Financial Gleaner that there is very little recent data on the size of the tech sector. He said, however, that most jobs now require some level of knowledge of technology. “When I started in this industry we were providing technologies and tools, running cable, and installing networks and computers in offices. All these things were connected by a wire; Wi-Fi never existed. A massive leap forward four decades later and we are communicating right now with technology that didn’t exist 40 years ago,” Reckord said. Reckord indicated that many other companies from abroad recruit tech workers from Jamaica, some doing so through LinkedIn and other social media sites. More than 500 persons graduate from the University of Technology, Jamaica, UTech, and the University of the West Indies, Mona campus with degrees in computing each year. The UTech annual report for 2019-20, the latest year available on the institution’s website, showed that there were 758 undergraduate offers in the School of Computing and Information, which is in the Faculty of Engineering and Computing. The bachelor’s degree in computing can be completed in either three or four years. Meanwhile, at UWI Mona in 2022-23, there were 1051 students registered in the Department of Computing across the three years of the bachelor’s degree. With technology rapidly changing the work world, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica is also changing how tech jobs are counted in labour force statistics. A representative at Statin said that while the Jamaica Industrial Classification, JIC, for industry workers underwent a review in 2024, the new classification has not yet been published. In the previous JIC in 2016, tech jobs were represented in the industry group ‘information and communication’. Statin last estimated the size of the information and communication employed workforce at 17,200 persons. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com

She has a Master’s in International Development from the University of Birmingham, UK. More Info United States President Donald Trump has vowed to make it easier to develop oil and gas projects in Alaska, despite concerns about environmental degradation. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to “unleash Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential”, effectively undoing former President Biden’s climate protections for the state. However, it is uncertain whether oil and gas companies will invest in a region with such strict regulations and high project development costs. In addition, many fear potential lawsuits from environmental and indigenous organisations against new developments, as well as what a change in U.S. administration could mean for projects in the future. President Trump’s order aims to expedite the permitting and leasing of energy projects in Alaska, undo resource development restrictions on state and federal lands including crucial areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), overturn the cancellation of leases within the ANWR, and prioritise the development of LNG. Alaska’s oil production decreased from around 2 million bpd in 1988 to just 426,000 bpd in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At present, just two major projects are under development, ConocoPhillips’s $8 billion Willow and Santos’ Pikka, which are expected to increase the state’s output to 650,000 bpd. Many oil and gas companies are wary of developing projects in Alaska due to the high costs involved with operations, the lack of regulatory stability, and litigation risks. Much of the state’s oil and gas reserves are within federally protected lands such as ANWR and NPR-A, which make project development risky, as a change in administration could mean more policy changes. In addition, several environmental groups have launched lawsuits against oil and gas developers in Alaska in recent years, citing environmental and climate concerns. “We’ve seen this before… where this administration breaks the law we will fight and we will enforce the environmental laws in Alaska,” the managing attorney at Earthjustice Carole Holley stated. Referring to the areas Trump is aiming to reopen for oil and gas exploration, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute Dustin Meyers stated, “Many of these areas have been closed for a good long while.” Meyers added, “There is always the risk that these areas could be reclosed after the next election cycle.” This view reflects the concerns of several oil majors. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency expects global demand for oil to slow over the next decade, while many oil and gas companies are moving to easier-to-develop areas where they can implement “low-carbon oil” operations. The Trump administration aims to attract investment for the $44 billion Alaska LNG project on Alaska’s North Slope, originally proposed by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) around a decade ago. The project was authorized by President Trump’s administration in 2020 and was reauthorized by the Biden administration in 2022. If developed, it could provide 20 million tonnes of LNG per year. “[Alaska] is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far. We’re talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and [the US] having to do with Alaska oil and gas,” Trump said at a joint press conference. However, over the last decade, several big players, including BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, have pulled out of the project. While it is unlikely that oil majors will flock to Alaska, given the plethora of challenges involved with managing oil and gas operations in the state, the threat of tariffs from the Trump administration could reinvigorate interest. On 4th March, Trump introduced 25 percent tariffs on the import of Mexican and Canadian products and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods. This has made other countries fear a similar move on their products. Trump has threatened tariffs on various countries and regions, such as the EU, if they do not increase the purchase of energy from the U.S. in the coming months. In early February, Japanese trading giant Mitsui announced it may consider investing in the Alaska LNG project, although no decisions had been made. Japan is the second-largest LNG importer globally and the government has stated that it may be open to purchasing more LNG and other energy products from the U.S., most likely in a bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on Japanese products. A few days later, Taiwan’s Economy Ministry expressed interest in purchasing more LNG from the U.S., particularly from Alaska. Taiwan’s state energy company CPC is “indeed quite interested in Alaska's natural gas and will continue to assess the feasibility and is also willing to make additional purchases,” the Ministry said in a statement. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and several EU member states have expressed interest in buying more U.S. oil and gas to reduce trade gaps that put them at risk of U.S. tariffs. However, with record highs being seen in U.S. gas production over the last year, it is not clear whether this will attract the interest and investment needed to develop new fossil fuel operations in Alaska.

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action. Momentum behind the initiative has been growing rapidly, with a Change.org petition directed at Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein surpassing 16,666 signatures as of press time. Meanwhile, influential SHIB group “Shibzens” have recently outlined compelling reasons why SHIB deserves ETF status, drawing parallels to the recent success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As per the group, one of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is the cryptocurrency’s massive and highly engaged community. With millions of holders actively participating in the SHIB ecosystem, it argued that the token enjoys a loyal user base that could drive demand, liquidity, and long-term price stability, key factors for a successful ETF. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, further strengthens its case. Since its launch in August 2023, the group emphasized that Shibarium has introduced real-world utility by powering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and payment solutions. The network also supports ecosystem tokens like BONE, used for gas fees, and TREAT, which could be incorporated into a diversified SHIB ETF, expanding its investment appeal. Another major factor is affordability. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be expensive for small investors, SHIB’s low price per token makes it an accessible entry point for retail traders. This inclusivity allows a broader investor base to gain crypto exposure, while SHIB’s high trading volume and strong liquidity provide a solid foundation for institutional ETF products. A SHIB ETF could also align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. The Shib Karma Foundation, a philanthropic initiative within the SHIB ecosystem, highlights the community’s commitment to social good. Additionally, SHIB’s growing adoption across industries, including gaming and payments, demonstrates its increasing real-world relevance and utility. This push comes amid significant political and institutional shifts that signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency, further strengthening the case for a SHIB ETF. Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently acknowledged major digital assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, fueling speculation that increased regulatory clarity could benefit altcoins like SHIB. On Friday, the President hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, bringing together key figures in the crypto industry. Among them was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, a well-known advocate for meme-based assets whose involvement has further bolstered optimism. The SHIB community led by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama have expressed optimism that Tenev could play a role in advocating for the inclusion of meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin in the discussions. That said, while BlackRock and Grayscale have yet to submit a formal application for a SHIB ETF, the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs proves that crypto-based investment products are viable. With strong community backing, increasing adoption, and favorable market trends, Shibizens believe SHIB is next in line.

AVAX’s rapid user growth in 2025 highlights potential for a breakout. And yet, it’s largely overlooked. Avalanche [AVAX] has been quietly gaining momentum, with new user sign-ups surging in Q1 2025. While the market often fixates on Ethereum’s L2 boom and Bitcoin ETFs, Avalanche’s rapid adoption has been overlooked somewhat. In fact, history suggests that user growth often precedes major price shifts. With DeFi and GameFi activity accelerating, could Avalanche be positioning itself as the next breakout L1? Avalanche’s new user growth has seen clear fluctuations over the past two years, with periodic cycles of rapid expansion followed by cooling-off periods. In fact, the latest surge in early 2025 was one of the strongest spikes since mid-2023. It saw monthly new users exceeding 600,000 and average daily sign-ups surpassing 6,000 at its peak. This seemed to be in stark contrast to mid-to-late 2024, when user acquisition stagnated below 200,000 per month. Source: X The pattern suggested that Avalanche tends to experience bursts of adoption, likely triggered by key ecosystem developments or broader market conditions. If this trend continues, the Q1 2025 spike could signal renewed investor and developer interest, potentially setting the stage for sustained growth. Avalanche’s recent surge can be attributed to a $250 million investment in December 2024, led by Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital, aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Additionally, the Avalanche9000 upgrade, launched on 16 December, reduced transaction fees by 75% – Driving a 38% hike in daily transactions and further boosting network activity. Institutional adoption has been rising too, with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton leveraging Avalanche for tokenized funds. Despite its surge in new users, Avalanche remains largely absent from mainstream crypto discussions. Much of the market’s attention is focused on Ethereum’s L2 expansion and Bitcoin ETF inflows, leaving Avalanche’s growth relatively overlooked. Media coverage has also been skewed, with Ethereum roll-ups and Solana’s memecoin frenzy dominating headlines. Another factor contributing to its relative silence is the lack of high-profile endorsements. Unlike Solana, which benefits from outspoken backers like Visa and Jump Crypto, Avalanche is yet to secure a similarly visible champion. However, this under-the-radar momentum might create an opportunity for early adopters positioning themselves ahead of a broader market realization. Source: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock data indicated that AVAX’s price action has closely followed whale activity, with occasional spikes in large transactions aligning with price movements. This suggested that institutional and whale investors remain engaged, though sustained accumulation might be uncertain. Source: IntoTheBlock Finally, there is a correlation between active addresses in profit and AVAX’s price cycles. Historically, sharp increases in profitable addresses have often preceded local price tops, while periods of underwater holders have set the stage for recoveries. If these patterns hold, AVAX could see further upside in 2025, provided demand remains strong and broader market conditions are favorable.

UPDATED 10:58 EST / MARCH 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Since the generative artificial intelligence awakening, we’ve said consistently that Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc. are the No. 1 and No. 2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, down on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt and more. Broadcom’s fiscal first-quarter results were impressive and support our base case for the company. They also calmed some investor concerns, at least for now. At one point the night after the earnings print, Broadcom’s stock was up 15% from its previous close, and finished up nearly 9% on Friday, despite a down day in tech. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high-growth sectors are not big enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. Nvidia doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different situation in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Multiple high-volume hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. In this Breaking Analysis, we pivot off of Broadcom’s Q1 earnings to revisit our thesis on the company. That premise has centered on the idea that connectivity both within the XPU complex and across distributed clusters remains a massive opportunity for Broadcom, combined with a radically new strategy for VMware that is delivering results much in the way as we projected. We initiated our Broadcom coverage in earnest on Breaking Analysis about three years ago, triggered by the VMware acquisition. Several of our research notes are shown below, tracking the company’s semiconductor and expanding software business. Let’s start by looking at how Broadcom applied its ethos to VMware. Broadcom’s acquisition strategy for VMware — initiated several years ago — has been executed in almost exact alignment with leadership’s publicly stated plans. Initially, industry observers were skeptical about Broadcom’s ability to “tame the VMware beast,” given VMware’s historically broad portfolio and aspirational visions. The subsequent narrowing of VMware’s focus, increased attention to core products, and elevated pricing strategy all confirm that Broadcom is following a well-defined operational model. Specifically, we expected Broadcom to focus research and development to prioritize core value areas, shed non-performing assets and push customers toward bundled subscription offerings. Though this tactic has created frustration among longtime VMware users accustomed to perpetual licensing structures, it has also driven measurable gains in revenue and profitability. This shift forces customers onto higher-value contract models, which in turn boosts average deal sizes. Notably, many critics attribute the changes to “price hikes,” although Broadcom characterizes them as “increased value.” There is legitimate merit to Broadcom’s assertions, despite the forced move to bundling. We documented this on theCUBE with Broadcom’s Drew Nielsen last summer at VMware Explore. We found the economic analysis to be fair and defensible, with the fundamental and controversial assumption that customers go “all in” on the VCF bundle. In our opinion, one of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan’s defining traits is a high “do:say” ratio. By closely examining past statements, we find that Broadcom’s strategic moves consistently align with Tan’s predictions. Our research suggests that customers — though often uncomfortable with the forced transition to subscription and bundled packages — benefit from a company that reliably executes on its roadmap. This level of predictability resonates with financial stakeholders, despite short-term challenges in the customer and partner ecosystems. Broadcom’s operational philosophy was highlighted last year at MWC, better known as Mobile World Congress, during discussions with the company’s semiconductor chief, Charlie Kawwas. The consistent message emphasized Broadcom’s ability to drive durable business outcomes and navigate new frontiers such as AI, all while applying the same methodical, profit-oriented approach. We believe these insights reinforce a unified corporate ethos — one that systematically applies proven processes to each new acquisition and market challenge. Though critics may continue to voice concerns about Broadcom’s vision for VMware’s combined offerings and licensing approaches, our research indicates that Broadcom’s results and track record of fulfilling stated goals cannot be dismissed. Customers that have long enjoyed perpetual licenses are being pushed toward subscriptions, often experiencing sticker shock in the process. Nonetheless, our data suggests that many of these organizations are willing to absorb the transition if they see tangible returns and ongoing product innovation. In our view, this dynamic underscores the importance of aligning cost structures with demonstrated value. Despite market chatter about negative customer experiences, Broadcom’s consistent execution has validated its strategic plan and strengthened its reputation on Wall Street. We believe the transition to a subscription-based model — though abrupt for some — reinforces Broadcom’s broader ambition of extracting higher margins and focusing on profitable, core technology areas. Our research indicates that VMware’s licensing and pricing changes — initiated under Broadcom’s stewardship — have triggered noticeable market backlash, which is reflected in the Enterprise Technology Research data. This data illustrates customer sentiments and spending intentions across several hundred VMware accounts, spanning various product lines. In our view, the most striking evidence of this negative reaction lies in the shift in Net Score — a metric similar to a Net Promoter Score except Net Score applies to spending intentions. Below we show the ETR methodology applied to VMware. Net Score tracks the percent of more than 700 VMware customers in the ETR survey within the following categories as shown above: Collectively, we see Net Score, which subtracts the red from the green and is reflected in the blue line, dipping from the mid-20s into negative territory, suggesting that VMware is experiencing real pressure in the market. The pervasion metric — VMware’s percentage of overall customers in the ETR survey — also declined, reinforcing the narrative that some organizations are walking away from or reducing their VMware footprints. One would look at these results and come to the conclusion that VMWare is in real trouble. But that conclusion is not correct. On the chart above the vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum, what we just explained in the previous chart, and you can see the dot plots for VMware over time. VMware’s Net Score went from around 20% down to the negative territory. It kept steadily tumbling since January of 2023. We’ve plotted Nutanix, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, picking three target platforms that potentially people would migrate to. We left Microsoft out because it always skews the data. One would look at this data and think it’s really bad news for VMware, but the reality is that this doesn’t reflect revenue — it’s an account-based metrics. In our opinion, these trends reflect a combination of higher costs, forced migrations to subscription bundles, and significant shifts in VMware’s operating model post-acquisition. VMware’s large installed base suggests that Broadcom is comfortable with the negative impact of abrupt pricing changes, reduced flexibility and low margin customer defections. The evidence shows that many customers continue to invest in VMware solutions, suggesting that the company retains a measure of loyalty, albeit forced, and a core foundation on which it can rebuild. Going forward, we believe it will be critical for VMware to strike a balance between monetization and customer satisfaction. This means a continued investment in core functionality and innovation, including supporting AI workloads with what VMware terms “Private AI” — that is, on-premises workloads. In our view, the driving rationale behind Broadcom’s evolving business model is shown below and describes the pressures facing traditional hardware infrastructure — specifically server, storage and networking. These segments are increasingly squeezed by advances in silicon, cloud economics and software, which continue to take value from the middle of the stack. As a result, Broadcom has systematically repositioned itself, participating more aggressively in two key value-creation areas: Last year at MWC 2024, Kawwas underscored the crucial role of networking in AI workloads. When scaling beyond single XPUs, interconnecting massive clusters becomes paramount. According to Kawwas, the inability to scale up to thousands of XPUs effectively — without the right networking strategy — diminishes performance and efficiency. In our view, Broadcom’s approach highlights its capacity to integrate hardware and software solutions that address the full scope of AI’s demands. [Kawwas explains the changes to connectivity required by AI workloads.] When you talk AI, everything has changed because with AI, you have these elephant workloads that cannot run on a single processor, whether it’s a GPU, TPU, NPU, the flavor of the day, let’s call them for the next 15 minutes XPUs. If you take these XPUs, and you take some of these elephant workloads, you can’t run them on a single XPU. You can’t even run them on eight CPUs or XPUs or GPUs, you have to now scale into the thousands today, thousands of these. In order to do that, you’ve transcended now a single system where you’ve scaled up. Now you have to scale out to many, many of these systems and racks, and you have to interconnect them. And guess what? If you don’t have the right network strategy and connectivity strategy, this will not work, this will not scale up. – Charlie Kawwas, Broadcom The conversation around AI also surfaces a notable duopoly in the networking space with only two company’s truly able to excel at connectivity within the chip and across large-scale clusters: We believe competition will intensify as AI expands beyond traditional data center workflows, but the massive market for flexible, high-performance network fabrics is booming. Though each player differentiates via proprietary versus more open approaches, the rapidly growing size of the AI market suggests headroom for both to thrive. Overall, we believe Broadcom’s strategy of balancing semiconductor innovation with infrastructure software is well-positioned to address the next wave of high-performance, AI-driven workloads. The one area we’ve felt was lacking for VMware has been its lack of a clear data strategy. It appears VMware generally will leave the data piece to its customers and others in the ecosystem to sort out. In reviewing Broadcom’s performance from May 2022 to March 2025, the numbers paint a vivid picture of how the VMware acquisition has fundamentally altered the company’s profile. The most striking theme is the accelerating shift toward software: Our analysis indicates that, while some legacy VMware customers are exiting due to price hikes or dissatisfaction with forced subscriptions, Broadcom remains focused on high-value customers willing to adopt its full VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack. According to Broadcom, approximately 70% of its top 10,000 customers have migrated to VCF, driving improvements in gross and operating margins. Those customers no longer aligned with Broadcom’s direction are effectively being pruned from the portfolio. Beyond VMware, Broadcom continues to leverage the surge in AI-driven workloads: One of the few negatives in Broadcom’s financial picture is free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, down from over 50% to around 40%. Management attributes the decline to several factors: Despite these headwinds, investors appear willing to tolerate near-term pressures in light of Broadcom’s operating discipline and rapid revenue expansion. Critics often liken Broadcom to a private equity firm, arguing it narrows R&D investment and focuses on near-term extraction. However, from our perspective, Broadcom employs a deliberate approach to concentrate R&D on core technologies (for example, Tomahawk switches, SerDes, custom silicon for hyperscalers). While it curtails broad experimentation, it invests heavily in targeted areas with strong returns — contributing to robust margins and a notable market valuation surge. Looking ahead, Broadcom’s strong orientation toward software, AI and custom silicon positions it to regain the trillion-dollar market-cap mark if current momentum continues. The TAM expansion signaled by Tan ($60 billion to $90 billion excluding the four new design wins), coming from hyperscaler demand for XPUs and AI infrastructure, further bolsters the bullish case. The chart above, developed by David Floyer, depicts total data center spending worldwide — including servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, and also hyperscale infrastructure. After years of relative flatness and even contraction in 2020, the market has entered a super cycle fueled by “extreme parallel processing” or EPP, or what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang often calls accelerated computing. Overall, the data center market is entering an era where parallel processing becomes the default architecture for emerging workloads, driving unprecedented growth and reshaping vendor strategies. From an investor perspective, companies enabling EPP — particularly in the areas of specialized compute, high-speed networking and AI acceleration — stand to capture significant new value as the market rockets toward a trillion dollars and beyond. Broadcom and Nvidia in our view are two of the most well-positioned “picks and shovel” companies that will benefit from the growth of this market. Broadcom now counts three primary hyperscalers (Meta, Google, ByteDance) plus two additional disclosed, plus two more unnamed design wins. In our view, these design wins anchor Broadcom’s strategy of mixing custom and merchant silicon, complemented by a robust software business. Broadcom’s durable approach — projects lasting 10 years or more — mirrors its history of building deep moats and reliable profit engines. The company highlights a $60 billion to $90 billion SAM by 2027 for its AI-related offerings, excluding the potential upside from the newly added “+2” hyperscalers. According to company statements, Broadcom’s AI business currently operates at a $16 billion run rate, growing at 40% to 50% (with a notable 77% spike in the latest quarter). These figures underscore a trajectory that could elevate Broadcom to a scale comparable to other top AI enablers such as Nvidia. Despite Broadcom’s positive momentum, regulatory questions loom. Hock Tan has been queried on how AI export restrictions and technology diffusion rules might impede sales to Chinese hyperscalers (for example, ByteDance and Alibaba). Though Broadcom can partially tailor its silicon to comply with controls (for example, down-tuning certain features), it ultimately cannot dictate geopolitical policy. The company’s ability to navigate these evolving restrictions will be crucial for sustaining future growth. Broadcom stands out as a durable, highly profitable enterprise, enjoying both near-term gains in AI networking and longer-term expansions of its custom silicon customer base. Though there are real risks — especially around export controls and an uncertain geopolitical environment — the company’s diversified approach, deep moats and robust margin profile suggest a compelling story for investors. Whether one is bullish, bearish or neutral likely depends on risk tolerance for regulatory issues and belief in Broadcom’s capacity to execute on its design wins. What do you think? Is Broadcom’s software strategy forcing you to rethink your on-prem infrastructure partners? Or are you staying the course and sticking with VMware, defecting or taking a hybrid approach?

This data illustrates customer sentiments and spending intentions across several hundred VMware accounts, spanning various product lines. In our view, the most striking evidence of this negative reaction lies in the shift in Net Score — a metric similar to a Net Promoter Score except Net Score applies to spending intentions. Below we show the ETR methodology applied to VMware. Net Score tracks the percent of more than 700 VMware customers in the ETR survey within the following categories as shown above: Collectively, we see Net Score, which subtracts the red from the green and is reflected in the blue line, dipping from the mid-20s into negative territory, suggesting that VMware is experiencing real pressure in the market. The pervasion metric — VMware’s percentage of overall customers in the ETR survey — also declined, reinforcing the narrative that some organizations are walking away from or reducing their VMware footprints. One would look at these results and come to the conclusion that VMWare is in real trouble. But that conclusion is not correct. On the chart above the vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum, what we just explained in the previous chart, and you can see the dot plots for VMware over time. VMware’s Net Score went from around 20% down to the negative territory. It kept steadily tumbling since January of 2023. We’ve plotted Nutanix, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, picking three target platforms that potentially people would migrate to. We left Microsoft out because it always skews the data. One would look at this data and think it’s really bad news for VMware, but the reality is that this doesn’t reflect revenue — it’s an account-based metrics. In our opinion, these trends reflect a combination of higher costs, forced migrations to subscription bundles, and significant shifts in VMware’s operating model post-acquisition. VMware’s large installed base suggests that Broadcom is comfortable with the negative impact of abrupt pricing changes, reduced flexibility and low margin customer defections. The evidence shows that many customers continue to invest in VMware solutions, suggesting that the company retains a measure of loyalty, albeit forced, and a core foundation on which it can rebuild. Going forward, we believe it will be critical for VMware to strike a balance between monetization and customer satisfaction. This means a continued investment in core functionality and innovation, including supporting AI workloads with what VMware terms “Private AI” — that is, on-premises workloads. In our view, the driving rationale behind Broadcom’s evolving business model is shown below and describes the pressures facing traditional hardware infrastructure — specifically server, storage and networking. These segments are increasingly squeezed by advances in silicon, cloud economics and software, which continue to take value from the middle of the stack. As a result, Broadcom has systematically repositioned itself, participating more aggressively in two key value-creation areas: Last year at MWC 2024, Kawwas underscored the crucial role of networking in AI workloads. When scaling beyond single XPUs, interconnecting massive clusters becomes paramount. According to Kawwas, the inability to scale up to thousands of XPUs effectively — without the right networking strategy — diminishes performance and efficiency. In our view, Broadcom’s approach highlights its capacity to integrate hardware and software solutions that address the full scope of AI’s demands. [Kawwas explains the changes to connectivity required by AI workloads.] When you talk AI, everything has changed because with AI, you have these elephant workloads that cannot run on a single processor, whether it’s a GPU, TPU, NPU, the flavor of the day, let’s call them for the next 15 minutes XPUs. If you take these XPUs, and you take some of these elephant workloads, you can’t run them on a single XPU. You can’t even run them on eight CPUs or XPUs or GPUs, you have to now scale into the thousands today, thousands of these. In order to do that, you’ve transcended now a single system where you’ve scaled up. Now you have to scale out to many, many of these systems and racks, and you have to interconnect them. And guess what? If you don’t have the right network strategy and connectivity strategy, this will not work, this will not scale up. – Charlie Kawwas, Broadcom The conversation around AI also surfaces a notable duopoly in the networking space with only two company’s truly able to excel at connectivity within the chip and across large-scale clusters: We believe competition will intensify as AI expands beyond traditional data center workflows, but the massive market for flexible, high-performance network fabrics is booming. Though each player differentiates via proprietary versus more open approaches, the rapidly growing size of the AI market suggests headroom for both to thrive. Overall, we believe Broadcom’s strategy of balancing semiconductor innovation with infrastructure software is well-positioned to address the next wave of high-performance, AI-driven workloads. The one area we’ve felt was lacking for VMware has been its lack of a clear data strategy. It appears VMware generally will leave the data piece to its customers and others in the ecosystem to sort out. In reviewing Broadcom’s performance from May 2022 to March 2025, the numbers paint a vivid picture of how the VMware acquisition has fundamentally altered the company’s profile. The most striking theme is the accelerating shift toward software: Our analysis indicates that, while some legacy VMware customers are exiting due to price hikes or dissatisfaction with forced subscriptions, Broadcom remains focused on high-value customers willing to adopt its full VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack. According to Broadcom, approximately 70% of its top 10,000 customers have migrated to VCF, driving improvements in gross and operating margins. Those customers no longer aligned with Broadcom’s direction are effectively being pruned from the portfolio. Beyond VMware, Broadcom continues to leverage the surge in AI-driven workloads: One of the few negatives in Broadcom’s financial picture is free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, down from over 50% to around 40%. Management attributes the decline to several factors: Despite these headwinds, investors appear willing to tolerate near-term pressures in light of Broadcom’s operating discipline and rapid revenue expansion. Critics often liken Broadcom to a private equity firm, arguing it narrows R&D investment and focuses on near-term extraction. However, from our perspective, Broadcom employs a deliberate approach to concentrate R&D on core technologies (for example, Tomahawk switches, SerDes, custom silicon for hyperscalers). While it curtails broad experimentation, it invests heavily in targeted areas with strong returns — contributing to robust margins and a notable market valuation surge. Looking ahead, Broadcom’s strong orientation toward software, AI and custom silicon positions it to regain the trillion-dollar market-cap mark if current momentum continues. The TAM expansion signaled by Tan ($60 billion to $90 billion excluding the four new design wins), coming from hyperscaler demand for XPUs and AI infrastructure, further bolsters the bullish case. The chart above, developed by David Floyer, depicts total data center spending worldwide — including servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, and also hyperscale infrastructure. After years of relative flatness and even contraction in 2020, the market has entered a super cycle fueled by “extreme parallel processing” or EPP, or what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang often calls accelerated computing. Overall, the data center market is entering an era where parallel processing becomes the default architecture for emerging workloads, driving unprecedented growth and reshaping vendor strategies. From an investor perspective, companies enabling EPP — particularly in the areas of specialized compute, high-speed networking and AI acceleration — stand to capture significant new value as the market rockets toward a trillion dollars and beyond. Broadcom and Nvidia in our view are two of the most well-positioned “picks and shovel” companies that will benefit from the growth of this market. Broadcom now counts three primary hyperscalers (Meta, Google, ByteDance) plus two additional disclosed, plus two more unnamed design wins. In our view, these design wins anchor Broadcom’s strategy of mixing custom and merchant silicon, complemented by a robust software business. Broadcom’s durable approach — projects lasting 10 years or more — mirrors its history of building deep moats and reliable profit engines. The company highlights a $60 billion to $90 billion SAM by 2027 for its AI-related offerings, excluding the potential upside from the newly added “+2” hyperscalers. According to company statements, Broadcom’s AI business currently operates at a $16 billion run rate, growing at 40% to 50% (with a notable 77% spike in the latest quarter). These figures underscore a trajectory that could elevate Broadcom to a scale comparable to other top AI enablers such as Nvidia. Despite Broadcom’s positive momentum, regulatory questions loom. Hock Tan has been queried on how AI export restrictions and technology diffusion rules might impede sales to Chinese hyperscalers (for example, ByteDance and Alibaba). Though Broadcom can partially tailor its silicon to comply with controls (for example, down-tuning certain features), it ultimately cannot dictate geopolitical policy. The company’s ability to navigate these evolving restrictions will be crucial for sustaining future growth. Broadcom stands out as a durable, highly profitable enterprise, enjoying both near-term gains in AI networking and longer-term expansions of its custom silicon customer base. Though there are real risks — especially around export controls and an uncertain geopolitical environment — the company’s diversified approach, deep moats and robust margin profile suggest a compelling story for investors. Whether one is bullish, bearish or neutral likely depends on risk tolerance for regulatory issues and belief in Broadcom’s capacity to execute on its design wins. What do you think? Is Broadcom’s software strategy forcing you to rethink your on-prem infrastructure partners? Or are you staying the course and sticking with VMware, defecting or taking a hybrid approach?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: I’ve spent a week taking on fighting game competitors with the Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO and it's the game-changer that might finally convert me from a fight stick

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is one of the most customizable leverless fighting game controllers yet, while still retaining the comfortable ergonomics of its flagship fight sticks. It will still take many more hours of mental rewiring if you're used to a traditional joystick, but with additional customizable buttons to suit your playstyle, there's no better way to transition over to this fighting game meta. Customizable button placements right out of the box Thin, light design but still with a comfortable wrist slope on the surface Switching out buttons is very easy More affordable than the standard Victrix stick Bulkier than other leverless options Leverless controls take time to adjust Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is the latest premium take on the leverless all-button controllers that have been transforming the fighting game community's meta in recent years, built for the current generation of consoles while still backwards compatible with last-gen consoles at the click of a switch (while the controllers are also compatible with PC, you will need to buy separate controllers for PlayStation and Xbox consoles). It's a much sleeker build than Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller while retaining similar features, such as customizable LED lights, a three-meter braided USB-C cable, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a comfortable ergonomic 6.28-degree wrist slope on its surface to prevent fatigue. It also includes L3 and R3 buttons that the Pro FS models lacked, while naturally including a tournament lock switch to disable all the other buttons on the top bar. Where the Pro KO really stands out from the other contenders vying to be one of the best fight sticks is just how customizable its buttons are, with the space for 16 mappable and movable buttons compared to the default 12 of other leverless controllers. With spare buttons provided within the shell of the controller, an easy-to-pop-open cover, and tweezers that make changing buttons accessible straight out of the box, it's an easily customizable controller where you can add and program new buttons that are most comfortable to reach for your play style. Being available at a better comparable price to similar options at launch makes it an excellent choice for players looking to convert to a leverless control style. While fighting pros will praise leverless controllers as more precise and immediate compared to a traditional arcade stick, it's still not the superior option without retraining muscle memory and getting used to the layout, even if being able to add a different place for the up / jump button can help with the adjustment. But for those prepared to put in the work and make the transition, the Pro KO is the best leverless controller to make that move. Launching in December 2024, the price point of the Victrix Pro KO is about right for other leverless controllers right now. It's much cheaper than the Victrix Pro FS-12 and better priced than its closest competitor the Razer Kitsune, which launched at $299, making it a relative bargain considering the wealth of additional customization offered out of the box. For pad players looking to take their fighting game prowess to the next level, the Victrix Pro KO is definitely a better price choice than shelling out for its premium arcade stick equivalent the Victrix Pro FS, which is among the most expensive fight sticks at the moment (it is however still my stick of choice). Stock is unfortunately in short supply for the PlayStation model currently, with Amazon taking orders but warning that shipping can take anywhere from three to six months. It's likely because PS5 consoles have largely been the preferred platform for tournaments, but if you're predominantly playing on PC then you might be better off going for the Xbox version, which is more widely available. Price $249.99 / £229.99 / AU$399.95 Dimensions 13.35 x 9.23 x 0.8in / 23.5 x 33.53 x 2.24cm Weight 2.7lbs / 1.225kg Compatibility PS5, PS4, PC or Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC Connection type Wired (USB-C) Buttons Cheery MX Speed Silver RGB Customization Buttons Software N/A Compared to Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller with the Pro FS-12, which essentially kept the same bulk and weight of its Pro FS arcade stick, the Pro KO is a substantial improvement, leveraging the leverless controller's strength as a lighter and more compact option. While its dimensions are still larger than competitors like the Razer Kitsune, it's still a comfortable size for taking to tournaments, slipping neatly into my laptop bag, or the strap bars on the side give you the option to add shoulder straps. The extra real estate is important for your hands though, as the surface incorporates a 6.28° wrist slope just like with Victrix's Pro FS models, which does wonders for preventing fatigue when playing for lengthy sessions. There are also more buttons on the top including dedicated L3 and R3 buttons while the PlayStation version includes the DualSense touchpad on the top left corner, all of which can be disabled with a tournament lock switch on the top-right corner to prevent accidentally pressing them during a heated tournament match. The 24-millimeter buttons are smaller than typical arcade sticks but the same size as other leverless designs, along with the single 30-millimeter button for the up / jump button that's designed to be within reach of your thumb, similar to a space bar. It's not the only comparison to a keyboard as the buttons are also comprised of Cherry MX Speed Silver RGB switches used in mechanical keyboards, making these buttons just as tactile and responsive as Sanwa Denshi buttons favored by professional fighting game players. While the controller has 12 buttons by default, what you'll notice are four other indents (one to the left of the directional buttons, two below the usual command buttons, and one to the left of the up/jump button) where other buttons can be added. These aren't optional extras, for when you pop out the top cover, by flicking the four switches beneath the controller base, you'll find that it snugly fits four spare buttons and switches, as well as a pair of tweezers that make it easy to remove the round caps and then add new buttons, or even replace a faulty button. Once added, you simply need to hold the function button on the top bar and then choose the button you want to map the new button to. It's just as easy to customize the color lighting for the button rings, while also adjusting the mode from static to breathing, prismatic, or you can simply turn them off if you prefer. When it comes down to it, the reason to own the Victrix Pro KO is because of how much more responsive and reliable just tapping directional inputs is than with a stick. In Street Fighter 6, instead of fumbling two-quarter circles to perform a super, I just need to tap down, forward, down forward, while a charge attack is more immediate if you're just tapping the button instead of moving the stick and back and forth, which may all seem like tiny fractions of milliseconds of a difference, but in any competitive environment, those all count. Arcade purists may sniff at these controllers, which had also caught controversy for being potentially too advantageous, leading to a few instances of leverless controllers being banned at some tournaments, not to mention that the Victrix Pro KO lacks Sanwa Denshi parts that the Pro FS-12 has. Yet in terms of tactility, the Cherry switches were every bit as clickable and responsive in my testing. If you're very new to leverless controllers, however, you shouldn't take them as an immediately superior controller compared to other existing options. Using buttons for directions intrinsically requires different muscle memory from using a stick - it's about the placement of your fingers and thumb over all the directional inputs rather than your thumb on a pad or your whole arm when using a stick. Personally, I still find it difficult to adjust to having the up / jump button located at the bottom, even though it's actually where you would expect a space bar to be, and so I found myself less capable of utilizing aerial moves. While there is arguably more precision in button inputs, that's only without factoring in pressure during an actual match. It's one thing to flawlessly execute supers in training mode but against an online opponent, I would still find myself tapping the inputs too fast incorrectly in the same way I can fluff the same inputs with a joystick. Nonetheless, as far as it goes to learning leverless controls, I found the Victrix Pro KO's button layout better than when I had previously tried the Razer Kitsune, which was a little more spread out and caused my left hand to cramp when trying to keep each digit over a respective directional button. The customizable button placements also greatly help with the adjustment. In my case, adding another jump button further to the left felt more reachable for my thumb, while adding another button just under the other attack buttons meant I could program a one-button parry that's far easier to reach. Ultimately, while I see myself improving in leverless controls the more I'm using the Victrix Pro KO, I'm still not confident in having it replace my Victrix Pro FS stick as my controller of choice at the next local tournament. After swapping back to a stick, I was simply more comfortable with a mix of air-to-air follow-ups that my brain had been struggling to compute with buttons- alone. If you however don't already have decades of arcade fighting game experience lodged in your brain and are also used to playing games with a keyboard, then going leverless is likely going to feel like a natural progression. You want one of the most customizable leverless controllers aroundLeverless controllers are already touted for their more responsive performance you have an even greater advantage by being able to easily add and program more buttons right out of the box. You want the same features as the Victrix sticks but with a lighter form factorThe Victrix Pro KO has a lighter and sleeker form factor comparable to other leverless controllers but still has the same great features as its fellow Victrix sticks such as the ergonomic wrist slope and the option to add a shoulder strap for carrying it around. You're expecting a superior controller overnightLeverless controllers may offer more precise and responsive inputs in theory but it also requires a lot of practice and mental rewiring if you've been used to arcade sticks or gamepads for many years.

Just be warned of its weight, size, and the need to spend more on extra compatible cables. For more information, check out our full Octopus Arcade Stick review With Street Fighter 6 being my regular fighting game fixture on the PS5, I swapped out my dependable Victrix Pro FS for the Victrix Pro KO for a week, though occasionally swapping back to get a comparison on the different feel of each controller. Firstly practicing offline with the newly added character Mai I gradually took the courage to adapt to leverless controls against other online opponents, getting my fair share of wins but also plenty of defeats, and making note of where I felt an improvement in using this controller and what felt like new limitations. I also played some matches while using the controller's audio jack with my Corsair Virtuoso Pro wired headset. On my gaming PC, I was able to test it out on the newly released Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, where I also started with some practice in arcade mode before attempting to take it online and making some progress in ranked matches. This was however an easier adjustment from Street Fighter 6 owing to fewer inputs while the up button is used less for jumping and more for side-stepping. Overall, I played around 8-10 hours with the Victrix Pro KO between both games, though arguably more so on Street Fighter 6 because it really is the best.

Antique rugs and carpets often don’t get the attention they deserve at auctions, yet these incredibly detailed decorative furnishings carry a rich heritage of highly skilled craftwork and symbolic imagery inspired by nature, mythology and world religions. That said, the exotic patterns and geographical origins of handwoven Persian rugs have captivated collectors for centuries. With natural dyes made from berries, insects, minerals and seeds, the dye recipes and weaving techniques in different regions were often carefully guarded secrets. In Ireland, the Swedish-born Per Lindfors (aka Peter Linden) was an acclaimed expert on antique carpets, rugs kilims and tapestries. From a young age, he soaked up knowledge of Persian rugs from his father – an avid collector – and his connections with Persian rug experts in Stockholm. And when he moved to Ireland, he ran the Peter Linden Gallery in Blackrock from 1979 until 2006. Thereafter, he continued to work at antique fairs and advise private clients worldwide on the provenance of antique carpets and rugs. His death in July 2024 marked the end of an era. In an interview with The Irish Times in 2019, Lindfors advised buyers to be alert to carpets, which have a darker colour at the root of the pile, as this indicates the dye is inferior quality. It may also mean that it has been given an antique wash, ie a chemical bath and left to age in the sun afterwards to make it look much older. Carpets are considered to be antique when they are 100 years old. Now, Adam’s – who previously sold much of the contents of the Peter Linden gallery in 2006- are selling the remaining stock, alongside some of his personal collection which he enjoyed with his wife, Celine, in their Dublin home. Some striking examples, from the auction of 94 lots, include: an antique Milas prayer rug from 1850, its border decorated with Solomon stars and blossoms (€3,500-€5,000); a Tree-of-Life Isfahan rug circa 1890-1900 decorated with elaborate foliage and birds framing a central vase (€700-€1,000); and an old Dobag carpet, hand knotted in Turkey 1995 (€3,500-€4,500). The Dobag project was a co-operative movement which started in the 1990s in Turkey to revive the handspun, natural dying techniques of antique rugs, but is no longer. The online auction, which also includes Lindfors’s library of reference books, finishes on Wednesday, March 12th, with viewing today/tomorrow from 1pm-5pm and on Monday/Tuesday from 10am-5pm. Also at Adam’s next week, is their spring jewellery online auction on Tuesday, March 11th, at 11am. Charming seasonal pieces include: a floral basket Giardinetto bouquet brooch (€2,000-€3,000); and two diamond bee brooches (€500-€700/€400-€600); and a diamond ballerina brooch in the style of the French jewellery house, Van Cleef & Arpels (€5,000-€6,000). Another more unusual piece is a sapphire and diamond ring, which unfolds to form a bracelet (€600-€800). Meanwhile, a collector of silver is selling his entire collection at Matthews Auction Rooms in Kells, Co Meath. The collection includes everything from silver tea sets to bowls, salvers, cutlery, boxes, novelty items (such as the Vesta case in the shape of a lying cow, at €40-€70), silver cased pocket watches and sets of silver coins. “The sets of 25 coins with original bank packaging are all pure silver, as are the one-kilo bars,” says Damien Matthews, who believes they will be well sought after. “They are all in mint condition and all way estimated below their scrap value.” The Matthews auction also has a series of three gold coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The 1oz gold coin has an estimate of €2,500-€3,500, while the ½oz gold coin has an estimate of €1,250-€2,250, and the ¼oz gold coin is priced as €800-€1,200. The seven hundred lots of jewellery contains a treasure trove of rings, bracelets, necklaces of various vintage and priced with plenty to suit all tastes. Natasha Bernon, from O’Reilly’s Auction Rooms, agrees that buying silver or gold jewellery can be a good way to invest. “The price of gold is at an all-time high [gold peaked at$2,956.15 on February 24th], which is encouraging people to put their money into something tangible,” she says. An eastern style set of two 21ct gold bangles (€800-€1,200), is one such example of gold jewellery on offer at the O’Reilly’s online fine jewellery sale, which ends on Wednesday, March 12th.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Ireland v France: Live updates from crunch Six Nations clash at the Aviva

That’s all from us for today. A disappointing result but them’s the breaks. Before we go, Scotland are after beating Wales 35-29 (read the report from Murrayfield here). So that just leaves England v Italy tomorrow (kick-off 3pm). We’ll be back here this day next week for Super Saturday. Until then, take it easy. And Gerry Thornley’s piece from the Ireland press conference is in: It’s been a long, long time since an Irish team has been rolled over in such a lopsided manner, especially at home. The home team and the home crowd, who were even more comprehensively second best, were left reeling as France scored 34 unanswered points in a blue blur of power and pace. Unbeaten at home in the Six Nations since France won here behind closed doors in 2021, Ireland had seemed relatively well set, or at any rate highly competitive, when Dan Sheehan’s 43rd-minute try and Sam Prendergast’s touchline conversion put them 13-8 ahead. Even interim head coach Simon Easterby felt so. “We felt like going in at half-time 8-6 down we were well in the game, and we were confident that if we started well – which we did – in the second half, we could kick on and make them pay, in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in second halves, which we have done in previous games. “But, unfortunately, we probably didn’t take enough of our opportunities in their 22, and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves.” Read Gerry’s full piece from the press conference here We’re back, and as promised we’ve some post-match reaction for you. First up: Fabien Galthié. Malachy Clerkin sat in on the France head coach’s press conference, and seemingly had to whip out the old English-French dictionary: Fabien Galthié was in no mood afterwards. The France coach pointedly didn’t take any questions in English but you didn’t need Duolingo to understand that he had a bone to pick. Losing Antoine Dupont to a serious knee injury midway through the first half coloured his reaction to everything. His captain was in tears in the dressingroom, Pierre-Louis Barassi didn’t make it through a HIA. Galthié was annoyed on both counts. “Our players did not return to the pitch,” he said. “We would like to understand why. On this issue, we are angry. We want to protect our players. There are means, [there are] rules. The [citing] commissioner must study the actions that are reprehensible or not. Neither Antoine nor Pierre-Louis returned to the pitch. One for a cleaning, the other for a contact. “For Antoine, there is suspicion of a fairly serious knee injury. I won’t go into details due to medical confidentiality, but Antoine is suffering. We have cited players to appear before the [Six Nations disciplinary] committee – Tadhg Beirne and Andrew Porter. Calvin Nash has also been summoned before the committee, for Pierre-Louis Barassi because he did not respond favourably to the protocol. “We feel bad for [Antoine]. In terms of the action, in my opinion it was reprehensible, and there are ways to study and analyse it. We feel for him today. He is suffering and we are suffering with him.” Read Malachy’s full piece from the press conference here Gerry Thornley’s dispatches from Simon Easterby’s press conference will be with us shortly. Thank you all for your company but hang tough, that reaction is coming. We will have more port match reaction from Gerry Thornley on Simon Easterby’s press conference and Malachy Clerkin who is looking after all things French. Midi Olympique give Yoram Moefana (8.5) and Francois Cros (8.5) to top their player ratings while two-try hero, Louis Bielle-Biarrey gets an eight. 🎥 Un bijou signé Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎An absolute beauty from Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎#FRAIRL | #SixNationsRugby pic.twitter.com/vKe4oI4dcv On the incident that saw Dupont suffer a knee injury Easterby said: “I think it’s just a rugby incident where Tadhg (Beirne) cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit on the back of that. This happens. We definitely have moved away and players have a real awareness now of cleaning out on the lower limb of the player, which would create that type of injury that might happen today, but that wasn’t the case. “He was securing his own ball and not making contact with Dupont and unfortunately that happens. I’ll probably have to look back at it again. We feel like the right decision was made there.” Ireland head coach Simon Easterby: “Disappointing, obviously. We felt like when we went in at half-time 8-6 down, we were well in the game and we were confident that if we started well, which we did in the second half, that we could kick on and make them pay in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in the second half, which we’ve done in previous games in the tournament. But unfortunately, we probably just didn’t take enough of our opportunities throughout the game in their 22 and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves. STATE OF THE NATION Ireland’s pursuit of a third successive victory in the Six Nations is no longer in their hands following their 42-27 defeat to France at the Aviva Stadium. Fabien Galthié‘s side are now two points ahead of Ireland in the table going into the final round of fixtures. On the last day, the French host Scotland at the Stade de France (8.0, Irish time). They have a 93-point advantage over Ireland – they travel to Rome to take on Italy – going into next weekend. A victory of any nature for France against the Scots in their last match would ensure that Ireland could not catch them. At the very least Ireland would need the Scots to win before any mathematics comes into play. The chances of a ‘three-peat’ of wins in the tournament are remote. If teams finish level on points, then the standings are decided by points differential. England can overtake Ireland in the table if they beat Italy with a four try, bonus point at Twickenham in Sunday’s game. They would put England second (15 points) behind France (16) with Ireland (14) in third place. England are away to Wales on the final weekend. The Scots have a four try, bonus point racked up already in the first half of their game with Wales but would go into the final weekend on 11 points. Essentially Ireland are looking for favours from their Celtic brothers Scotland and Wales, while also requiring a win in Rome. What about the lies, damn lies and statistics. Well Ireland had more attacking minutes 16.8 to 15.1, carried for more metres 886 to 744, beat more defenders 21-19 and had more offloads 9-8 while the French made more line-breaks 6-4, fewer handling errors 11-17 and fewer turnovers 7-11. France made 196 tackles and missed 21 while Ireland made 97 and missed 19. France conceded 13 penalties to Ireland’s six. Ireland had two yellow cards. Gerry Thornley’s match report is in. He wrote: “France put Ireland to the sword and utterly obliterated hopes of a Grand Slam, also ending any realistic designs on a historic three-peat next weekend. What’s more, France did so despite losing their talisman early in the piece, so shredding any notion that they might be overly dependent on Antoine Dupont. “Despite one of their battery of backrowers also playing much of the second half in midfield, France’s 7-1 split reaped a rich dividend as their amalgam of power and pace shredded Ireland in the third quarter. Ireland just do not have finishers like the jet-heeled Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud. “Their defence also smashed Ireland in the collisions, and the injection of the Bomb Squad did not dilute this in any way. Their backrow were immense, particularly Paul Boudehent.” You can read the rest of his report here Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are in, three Irish players get seven, the highest mark, one of which is captain, Caelan Doris. Johnny wrote: “The lineout worked and he was a good Irish option there. Made some big tackles, notably on Thomas Ramos in the first half, and ground away in the engine room.” You can read the rest of the ratings here.

He’s been chewing on the top of the red pen. 🗣 "That last 35 minutes is as bad as Ireland have played in some time. It could be damaging for them."🗣 "France played brilliantly!"Rob Kearney and Matt Williams react to Ireland 27-42 France.#IREvFRA | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/mtcKbmCip6 That was a chastening afternoon for Ireland, the first in a very long time. Forget about the late salvo that yielded 14-points and tries for replacements Cian Healy and Jack Conan. It won’t console players of Irish supporters. The home side received a lesson today in how to ruthlessly finish off opportunities. France did this without captain, Antoine Dupont whom they lost to a knee injury in the first half, centre Pierre-Louis Barassi (HIA) in the second and ended with up replacement and try scorer Oscar Jegou, a flanker playing in the centre. Louis Bielle-Biarrey demonstrated why he is one of the best players in the world with a brace of tries, Damian Penaud’s breakaway effort saw him equal the French try scoring record held by Serge Blanco. French head coach Fabien Galthié‘s decision to opt for a 7-1 split on the bench, despite the injuries to two backs, proved to be a masterstroke as the arrival of the front five pack replacements had a significant impact on the outcome. Fulltime: Ireland 27 France 42 80(+1) CONAN TRY. Prendergast with a quick tap penalty and Conan grabs a second Irish try in three minutes. Prendergast lands the conversion but it’s nothing more than window dressing on the scoreboard. France were stunning for half an hour in the second half, played glorious rugby and were worthy winners. Ireland can and will have no complaints. Ireland 27 France 42 77 mins: TRY HEALY. In his 137th game for Ireland and the final one at the Aviva Stadium, grabs a try. It’s a lovely personal moment. Prendergast converts. Ireland 20 France 42 72 mins: Prendergast with a couple of chips through that he might like over again but Ireland are at least showing character. There accuracy though in the French 22 is seriously lacking. Right on cue Prendergast’s pass six metres from the French line was intercepted by Ramos and he released Penaud who races 75 metres to score under the posts. Ramos converts. Ireland 13 France 42 69 mins: Ireland with a great try scoring chance but Robbie Henshaw steps back inside rather than looking at the man outside. Conor Murray then gets over the line but replacement prop Cyril Baille gets underneath him and denies him a try. Ireland 13 France 35 68 mins: Cian Healy, Rob Herring and Conor Murray are on for Porter, Sheehan and Gibson-Park. 64 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: Doris goes off for a HIA. Van der Flier back on. Prendergast on a wrap around but he tries to take the space and gets collared by Jegou. The pass might have been the better option there. France are utterly dominant. Ireland penalised again at a ruck. Ramos points at the points. Ireland 13 France 35 France have scored 29-points from seven visits to the Ireland 22. France have scored 24 points in second half 12 minutes and claimed a four try bonus point. 58 mins: TRY JEGOU. The impact of the French bench and Ireland going down to 14 players has resulted in the visitors running riot. They’ve been breathtaking in the rugby they’ve played. Ireland 13 France 32 56 mins: Nash is back on, Ireland are back to 15 players. The damage has been done. James Ryan is on for McCarthy. 55 mins: RAMOS PENALTY. A blue tidal wave. France back on the attack and they are within metres of the Irish line when Doris is pinged for playing the nine, Lucu. Alldritt turns to Ramos to kick the penalty and the French fullback duly obliges. Jack Crowley is on for Ireland; he’ll play in the centre. Aki is off. Ireland 13 France 25 48 mins: Nash is in the sin bin under review for his yellow card. Decision is in. It’ll remain a yellow. Barassi is undergoing a HIA. Jack Conan is on for O’Mahony who receives a huge ovation in his last game at the Aviva Stadium. Ryan 49 mins: TRY Bielle-Biarrey. France on a sweeping counter-attack go down the wing where Nash would have been - he’s still in the bin - work the ball wide to Bielle-Biarrey, the wing hits the afterburners, grubbers and wins the footrace. Ramos kicks the conversion. The French make four changes to their pack. Ireland 13 France 22 46 mins: TRY BOUDEHENT. France on penalty advantage power their way forward, winning each collision and eventually, Ireland run out of numbers and Boudehent forces his way over. The visitors were on penalty advantage. The TMO, Ian Tempest, comes in to draw attention to a head collision. Nash receives a yellow card for his head clash on Barassi. They look at an incident in the build-up but Gardner on review says that a clear-out on O’Mahony was legal. He awards the try and Ramos kicks the conversion. Barassi is off for a HIA. Oscar Jegoum, a flanker is on in the midfield. Ireland 13 France 15 Whatever was said by Ireland coach Simon Easterby has worked nicely. Ireland were bright again from the opening whistle. 43 mins: TRY SHEEHAN. Ireland kick the penalty to the corner. Beirne with the take and the Irish maul is well-crafted, moves forward, and then Sheehan breaks off the back and drives through the tackle of Lucu for a fine try. Prendergast lands the touchline conversion, a lovely kick. Ireland 13 France 8 42 mins: Ireland bought a penalty there after sustained pressure, Bielle-Biarrey caught offside. Looked at the Dupont incident. The French scrumhalf was trying to jackal when Tadhg Beirne, propelled by those behind him, looked to clear out legitimately and drove Dupont backwards at an angle. 26mins IRE 0-5 FRAFrance with the opening score of the match as Louis Bielle-Biarrey goes over in the corner following a well-worked line-out.

Ireland dominate the first 20-minutes only to fall to a sucker punch score on virtually the first occasion that France get into their 22. French wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey scores a try for the seventh time in the last seven Tests. Ireland lost Joe McCarthy to a yellow card for a silly pull back on Thomas Ramos. It was during his absence that France scored, the launchpad a lineout maul, where McCarthy’s power was missed. The visitors lost captain Antoine Dupont to what looked like a knee injury, when he was cleared-out at the ruck. Twice subsequently Dupont’s successor as captain, Alldritt, went to match referee Angus Gardner to ask him to get the officials to have a look at the incident. Prendergast, who had earlier hit an upright with a penalty, landed his next opportunity but Ireland then conceded a similiar opportunity, a ridiculously harsh decision. Ramos kicked it but in first half injury time Prendergast landed a monster penalty from the halfway line. Half-time: Ireland 6 France 8 40(+1) mins: Ireland are claiming that there was a head shot on Porter. Referee is unmoved rightly pointing out that if there was it will be called. The home side have a penalty on the halfway line. Prendergast thumps it over. Superb strike. Ireland 6 France 8 35 mins: That’s another questionable decision. Osborne brilliant on kick-chase, nabs Penaud eight metres from the French line. Pierre-Louis Barassi clears Doris out from the side but France get a scrum, knock-on is the ruling. Ireland 3 France 8 35 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: That’s a ridiculous decision. France giving a penalty for alleged interference from kickoff by Andrew Porter. He did nothing to obstruct Damian Penaud. The French wing bought that penalty. Ramos makes not mistake. That’ll stick in the Irish gut. Ireland 3 France 8 33 mins: PRENDERGAST PENALTY: Ireland go on to attack again, get a lucky ricochet from a kick which Nash collects, two rucks later, Henshaw grubbers through on penalty advantage from a tackle off the ball by Paul Boudehent. Prendergast makes no mistake. Ireland 3 France 5 31 mins: Gardner and Doris are having a long dialogue about keeping distance. Alldritt is back to Gardner about the injury that ended Dupont’s participation. The Australian referee is having none of it. Ireland 0 France 5 27 mins: Ireland under pressure again. Referee Angus Gardner is fighting a running battle with Ireland about wishing to speed up lineout and play on. He’s ignoring any injury issues. Then he wants to play on when Dupont is injured. Dupont is gone. France complaining about the clear-out. Alldritt wants him to look at it again. Gardner says that they have and it’s just a rugby collision/injury. Maxime Lucu is on. France now have seven forwards left on the bench. Gamble doesn’t pay off. Bielle-Biarrey with a chip through. He claims that he is tackled late. No one else agrees though. McCarthy is back on the pitch. Ireland get the 22 drop out. Five points conceded in the 22 minutes that McCarthy was off. Ireland 0 France 5 TRY: Bielle-Biarrey. France get their maul going forward and two passes down the short-side send Bielle-Biarrey over in the corner. That comes off Ireland having 70 percent possession. The visitors show them how to be ruthless in the scoring zone. Ramos misses the conversion. Ireland 0 France 5 19 mins: France counterattack, Bielle-Biarrey chips and chases but McCarthy’s actions in pulling back a support player, think it was Thomas Ramos, gets him a yellow card. Silly, silly. France kick to the corner. YELLOW CARD: McCarthy. Ireland 0 France 0 18 mins: Great rip by Osborne but France regain possession only for Doris to win it back. Ireland clear long, France respond in kind before Prendergast finds touch in the French half. Doris is having a huge game. Ireland 0 France 0 14 mins: Ireland attack the short-side through Jamie Osborne, Ireland continue to pummel away inside the French 22, but a knock-on from Joe McCarthy and then a penalty at a ruck allows France to get into the Irish half for the first time. Ireland 0 France 0 13 mins: Good aggressive defence from the French forces Ireland to lose possession which culminates with Dupont racing under the Irish posts but there are two French knocks-on in the build-up. A scrum on the French 22 is the upshot. Ireland 0 France 0 11 mins: France penalised on the double, one for an arm hook at a lineout and the other for offside after a great break from Keenan. Prendergast kicks into the French 22. Peter O’Mahony off the top to Joe McCarthy on the peel, then Doris, then Sheehan, as Ireland inch towards the French line. Brilliant tackle by Louis Bielle-Biarrey on Keenan. 9 mins: Superb work by Doris to win a ruck penalty but Sam Prendergast sees his kick from the French 10-metre line hits the left hand upright. Ireland 0 France 0 7 mins: Superbly direct from Ireland, Josh van der Flier and Aki making some serious yards deep inside French 22 but the visitors win a turnover penalty at a ruck. Gregory Alldritt. 4 mins: First scrum, Ireland put-in. Re-set. Ireland get free-kick for early engagement. Ireland win a penalty after Dupont is penalised for offside. Prendergast kicks into French 22. Tadhg Beirne wins lineout. Dan Sheehan breaks off, grounded short. Dupont offside again and Ireland get a penalty. That’s three penalties and a free kick that France have conceded. Sheehan with a quick tap and Caelan Doris gets held up over the line. Goal-line drop out. Ireland 0 France 0 1 min: Great start for Calvin Nash, super chase and take of Jamison Gibson-Park’s high ball. That’s nice width and change-up from Ireland. Nash involved again but the move peters out with a handling error. Bundee Aki receives treatment after receiving a ball to the face. Ireland 0 France 0 There’s no doubting the emotion of the occasion for several of the Irish line-up, exemplified by Peter O’Mahony and Cian Healy. Time for kickoff. The teams are out for the anthems. 10 minutes to kickoff. There will be a minute’s silence for the former Irish international late Dr Bill Mulcahy. Lowe suffered a back spasm. Ireland’s two first choice wings, Hansen and Lowe miss out. Over to Osborne and Nash. JAMES LOWE IS OUT. CALVIN NASH IN AND WILL WEAR 11 JERSEY. Murray Kinsella caught the on-pitch treatment. Calvin Nash has his bib off and is running on the right wing in the warm-up with Jamie Osborne switching to the left wing. James Lowe seems to be in a fair bit of pain. pic.twitter.com/iLgqOdiaY9 IRELAND INJURY ALERT: James Lowe has just limped down the tunnel. Received treatment to his hip and looks in a lot of discomfort. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) estimate that there are 10,000 French supporters in Dublin although walking around the city there seems to be a great deal more. In the the Six Nations (2000–present), Ireland have played France on 25 occasions, Ireland winning 11, France 12 and two matches have been drawn. One of Ireland’s 50-cappers, Finlay Bealham, gets interviewed. Finlay Bealham chatted Roy about haircuts, food and life in the front row! Thanks to everyone at @IrishRugby for having us.Catch Ireland v France on @RTE2 & @RTEplayer from 1.15pm, Online with @RTEsport and tune in to @RTERadio1. #IrishRugby #TeamOfUs #SixNations #IREvFRA #RTÉ pic.twitter.com/U2Lw2zdUe0 Late tee time Saturday means morning watching Ireland v France 💪🏻☘️ @IrishRugby @SixNationsRugby Antoine Dupont (France): “Ireland have lost very few matches, they have a very rigorous system that we know. They’re (strong) attacking and defending. They have very clear processes that allow them to win matches against all the teams in the world. “They’re doing a very good job - it also pushes us to be at our best level to be able to compete with this kind of team. It will be up to us to be the master of our game, not to make mistakes, not to give the opportunity to the Irish to attack us with penalties. “We know when it’s like that they’re hard to stop. We see all the games played on their defence, they almost always manage to slow down the ball. It’s a very well done job. “We see that they know the laws very well and that they are at the limit of being penalised – they’re not always at the limit, they’re very good at it. “So, it’s up to us to do our best to get fast ball, and if they are at the limit, we hope we’ll do very well. We’ll play fair, but we’re not worried about it.” A word from the captains. Ireland’s Caelan Doris: “We’re very much aware of the threat France pose and the quality they’ve got individually, but what they can do collectively as well. “We’ve seen that with some of the scorelines they’ve put down against some other quality teams, and we’ve experienced it first-hand as well a number of times too so we’re definitely aware that we’re going to need to be at our best. “But there’s excitement to go there and to have our best performance yet. Some of the fixtures against France in the past are up there with my favourite games that I’ve been involved in. “Marseille last year was a special venue to play in, very cool. Thinking back to the Aviva in ‘23, unbelievable atmosphere, very good game. “One of the highest ball-in-play times I think that we’ve had. So, it’s two teams with an attacking mindset and attacking desire, and hopefully it will make for a good watch.” Gerry Thornley had a look at the two best scrumhalves in the world, Jamison Gibson-Park and Antoine Dupont. Here are his thoughts. A bunch of Savoyards I met in Temple Bar. There won’t be a goat milked in the French Alps tonight. #IREvFRA pic.twitter.com/rJqRgbGv5y Romain Ntamack started all five games in France’s most recent Grand Slam (2022) but only once was in the run-on team since then in a Six Nations match, against Wales, the opening game in the tournament a game in which he was sent off. He’s back today following that suspension, partnering Antoine Dupont for the 29th time. Fun fact number one courtesy of Ryle Nugent who’s sitting across from me. Ireland have trailed twice in this season’s Six Nations at half-time, against Wales and England and came back to win both games. If they were to trail against France at the interval this afternoon and win the game, it is the first time to accomplish that in Dublin since 1928. A notable occasion for six Irish players. Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Cian Healy, who are retiring from international rugby at the end of the Guinness Men’s Six Nations, will lead out the teams ahead of today’s game. They will be followed by Caelan Doris, Jack Conan and Finlay Bealham, who are winning their 50th caps. Conor Murray will be accompanied by his nephew, Theo Cooper. I spoke to Ian McKinley, Ian Keatley, Michael Kearney and Paddy ‘Rala’ O’Reilly who know Healy, Murray and O’Mahony. You can read it here. Lets have a look at the teams and officials. IRELAND: Hugo Keenan (UCD RFC/Leinster); Jamie Osborne (Naas RFC/Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Buccaneers RFC/Leinster), Bundee Aki (Galwegians RFC/Connacht), James Lowe (Leinster); Sam Prendergast (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (UCD RFC/Leinster), Dan Sheehan (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Galway Corinthians RFC/Connacht), Joe McCarthy (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Lansdowne FC/Munster), Peter O’Mahony (Cork Constitution FC/Munster), Josh van der Flier (UCD RFC/Leinster), Caelan Doris (St. Mary’s College RFC/Leinster) (capt). Replacements: Rob Herring (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster), Cian Healy (Clontarf FC/Leinster), Thomas Clarkson (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster), James Ryan (UCD RFC/Leinster), Jack Conan (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Ryan Baird (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Conor Murray (Garryowen FC/Munster), Jack Crowley (Cork Constitution FC/Munster). FRANCE: Thomas Ramos (Toulouse); Damian Penaud (Bordeaux-Bègles), Pierre-Louis Barassi (Toulouse), Yoram Moefana (Bordeaux-Bègles), Louis Bielle-Biarrey (Bordeaux-Bègles); Romain Ntamack (Toulouse), Antoine Dupont (Toulouse) (capt); Jean-Baptiste Gros (Toulon), Peato Mauvaka (Toulouse), Uini Atonio (La Rochelle), Thibaud Flament (Toulouse), Mickaël Guillard (Lyon), Francois Cros (Toulouse), Paul Boudehent (La Rochelle), Grégory Alldritt (La Rochelle). Replacements: Julien Marchand (Toulouse), Cyril Baille (Toulouse), Dorian Aldegheri (Toulouse), Emmanuel Meafou (Toulouse), Hugo Auradou (Pau), Oscar Jegou (La Rochelle), Anthony Jelonch (Toulouse), Maxime Lucu (Bordeaux-Bègles). Referee: Angus Gardner (Australia) Assistant Referees: Matthew Carley, Christophe Ridley (both England) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Andrew Jackson (England) Speaking of benches, France head coach Fabien Galthié has opted for a 7-1 split with scrumhalf Maxime Lucu the only back listed. Flanker Paul Boudehent has previously played in the centre. The Springboks were pioneers of this strategy, including employing it against Ireland in the World Cup, which Andy Farrell’s side won, again in the final itself and most recently against Scotland in November. France opted for this alignment in the victory over Italy last time out. Where to start? Well maybe a quick look at the teams. Mack Hansen is injured (quad), Garry Ringrose is suspended, Jamie Osborne switches to right wing, Hugo Keenan returns at fullback, Finlay Bealham returns to tighthead while captain, Caelan Doris has shrugged off a knee injury to lead the team. Rob Herring is back on the bench, Jack Conan has recovered from a back injury, while Ireland have opted for a six-two split on the bench with Conor Murray and Jack Crowley the backline cover. The superstars of Ireland and France will need to be at the peak of their powers to claim victory in 'The Dublin Decider' - #IRLFRA @SixNationsRugby @IrishRugby #rtesport @RTE2 @RTEplayer pic.twitter.com/NrrMmZpDlN Salut mes copains and copines to our French readers on this warm-ish, dry-ish Irish afternoon in Dublin. Hello and welcome to the Irish Times rugby blog. John O’Sullivan here, and at no further expense I will be keeping you up to date pre, during, and after Ireland’s seminal Six Nations Championship clash against France at the Aviva Stadium. It’s a mouthwatering clash between two sides that have occupied to the top two placings in the tournament for the past two campaigns. Indeed, France have finished second in four of the last five stagings. The French finished runners up to England in 2020, runners-up to Wales in 2021, won the Grand Chelem – that’s my bilingual nod – in 2022, second to Ireland in 2023, second to Ireland in 2024. Johnny Watterson will be evaluating the Ireland players. He’s got new red and green pens. Gerry Thornley’s match report will be available shortly after the game. Malachy Clerkin will be man-marking Antoine Dupont with a rigour of which the Ireland team would be proud. There is a huge French presence around the Ballsbridge area and the Marseillaise was belted out by a group of 30 as they walked down Lansdowne Road. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 3 major risks could send the stock market tumbling even further
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-major-risks-sp500-tariffs-ai-inflation-recession-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-08T10:50:01Z
Full Content:
Stocks have endured a bumpy period over the last few weeks amid a chaotic start to President Donald Trump's second term. Since February 19, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Most Wall Street estimates remain positive, but investors worry that three key risks could send stocks tumbling even further. Fears that the US economy is heading toward a recession have resurfaced in recent weeks. After a false alarm in 2022 and 2024, signals of potential labor market softening have again fueled worries of a downturn. "Both WARN and Challenger data point to a further rise in private sector layoffs to come in March, and growing anxiety in the consumer confidence surveys about the future health of the labor market usually is a reliable sign of rising joblessness to come too," said Samuel Tombs, Chief US Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on Friday. Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro, also said in a client note on Friday that the weakness is likely to continue. One reason for this is that state and local government spending on salaries is dipping sharply, as is spending on construction wages, a leading indicator. Spending in these areas has fallen during prior downturns. "I don't see an end unless the Fed takes steps to lift demand," he said in a note on Friday. Investors were tuned into February's non-farm payroll report on Friday morning for clues about where the labor market is headed. They didn't get much insight as the US economy added 151,000 jobs, near expectations, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly inched up to 4.1%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the US economy remains solid, sending stocks climbing. But Trump's on-and-off implementation of tariffs has added another level of uncertainty to economic growth, Wall Street banks say. Firms like Apollo, BCA Research, and TD Cowen have all warned of the rising likelihood of recession thanks to tariffs. Goldman Sachs on Friday also raised its recession odds for the next 12 months from 15% to 20% due to tariffs, but acknowledged the import fees could be reversed. "We have raised it by only a limited amount at this point because we see policy changes as the key risk, and the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious," Jan Hatzius, the bank's chief US economist, said in a note. "If policy headed in the direction of our risk scenario or if the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further." On the flip side of tariff-related recession worries are concerns that the import taxes will drive up consumer goods prices. So, even if the economy is resilient, rising prices could lead the Fed to hike rates again, creating downward pressure on stocks and on consumers. Or an even worse situation could arise: prices could surge due to tariffs while the economy continues to weaken. "Tariffs are a self-inflicted stagflationary policy for the U.S. economy that was otherwise poised to continue growing at a solid pace," said Phill Colmar, managing partner and global strategist at MRB Partners, in a note Friday. "The U.S. exceptionalism theme will continue to unwind, and U.S. equities are not yet priced for downside growth risks." Inflation has seen a slight resurgence in recent months, rising from 2.4% in September to 3% in January. The Fed is expected to implement two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. Outside of the shaky macroeconomic picture, the mega-cap AI stocks that drive broader stock-market indexes could continue to suffer. That's because their strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure has come into question after the release of a cheaper and more energy-efficient chatbot from Chinese firm Deepseek. Investors have suddenly been made to wonder if the valuations these stocks have commanded on the promise of impressive future growth are justified. The paradigm shift has been painful for US AI stocks. Year-to-date, shares of Nvidia are down 18.5%, Microsoft is down 6%, Amazon is down 9.5%, and Alphabet has dropped 7.8%. Meanwhile, Chinese AI stocks have rallied: shares of Alibaba, who also released a relatively inexpensive chatbot, are up 65% year-to-date, while JD.com and Tencent have risen 23% and 28%, respectively. "AI is here to stay, and if anything, DeepSeek reinforces that. However, the latest developments do also show that investment approaches that are too concentrated or overly passive can be risky, as value can quickly shift within the AI ecosystem," said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a January 28 note. "An active and diversified approach is a better way to gain exposure to AI, in our view." Jump to

What caught my eye this week. Nobody asked for it and now it’s here – the new Monevator shop is open, offering in-joke themed investing T-shirts and vaguely punny sweatshirts to all. Perhaps you’ve already spotted Monevator members striding about town sporting fancy wares like this: Yes, those cool cats got early access. Thanks to everyone who bought something and so beta-tested the new store for us. Now to repeat what I said to them, being a Monevator member is by far the best way to support the site. The margins on digital products are unbeatable – after the taxman has taken his share most of the money goes to us. This helps to keep the lights on and us publishing, week after week. In particular, please don’t buy anything from the shop if you think there’s a chance you’ll return it. The margins are terrible and returns will wipe them out. We’re only really doing this for strategic brand-building mindshare capture mutual fun. There’s an FAQ. Our merch is made by print-on-demand giant Printful, and all payments are securely handled by the globe-spanning Shopify. Finally, you’ll also find a digital bookshop (it links to Amazon) of our 24 favourite investing books. Hope to see you at an investing conference or under a Canary Wharf skyscraper – or failing that at the gym – in a Monevator hoodie soon! Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Congrats on getting the “merch” up and running. I hadn’t realised that you had given members early access: was that in a email/newsletter? Note that I intentionally killed off emails/newsletters as I prefer to read posts on this website, so may have missed the alert this way. @Curlew — Yes, besides it being a little membership perk I introduced the shop to members in stages to stagger any support issues if anything didn’t work and also to stop our working capital getting overwhelmed with demand (because we have to pay up front for the merch to be made) Needn’t have overly worried on either score 😉 Boom. In like Flynn for a DNFS t shirt to wear in the gym. Great way to be able to support a fantastic resource. Free shipping too! You spoil us. @TI Thanks for the clarification. Note that I couldn’t find anywhere in the account settings to turn on/off newsletters/emails…I had to resort to the blunt instrument of creating an email rule to delete to anything from you, no offence 🙂 Moreover, after signing up to membership I never received newsletters at all (which was fine) but after a few months they suddenly started appearing in my inbox. Odd. Hence why I tried to find a way of stopping them. You could have caps, like Make Investing Great Again caps… Typoette “Michael Sheen writes of £1m of debt …..” With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb On the subject of filling in missing years of NI, has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest, but it obviously varies with a few parameters and some soft factors that are not straightforward to predict (eg means testing potentially being introduced one day) .ls. “arbdn” sh..ld b. abrdn sh..ld .t n.t 🙂 @Factor – you missed Dali/Dalio @Rob (8) That’s like comparing the certainty of an annuity with the vagaries of drawdown. The drawdown option would probably pay off but there are no guarantees. Everything I’ve heard suggests that buying missing years of NI contributions is a bargain for the near-certain guaranteed income it buys. This should remain at least CPI-inflation-protected even if the triple lock does not survive. Of course, it is important to ensure that the extra years you buy will actually improve your state pension. If you will reach 35 years anyway before SPA it will not help, and you have to be very careful about filling in gaps before 2016. Thanks for the orders guys — and for the typo spots! (I’m embarrassed about missing the Dalio ‘o’ but I’m absolutely letting myself off the abrdn SNAFU 😉 ) @Rob It’s currently £17.45 for a class 3 stamp (per week) State pension is £6.32 for each of the 35 required stamp years. £221.20 pw for 24/25 with 35 years ) If I was a 66 year old the annuity rate would be 36% v current open market annuity rates of about 4%. To me it looks close to the best investment one could make. The best being class 2 Ni £3.45 per week. Paying for extra year a long time before retirement may change the numbers but surely not enough to be worth not buying the extra year. I think Ermine has some thoughts on one of his posts @Rob #8 has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest Perhaps you have the gift of exceptional youth and hence a long appreciation time, but it’s really hard to beat a over 100% annuity rate at Class II rates – my old post on the SP has been overtaken by some changes but the principle is still there. Provisos are that it is rational to make up missing years later in your working life rather than earlier (you must make them before reaching SPA) because you don’t know your career path. Early retirees by definition have a shorter working life than most. You need 35 qualifying years – my working life was 30 so I was 5 years short. I bought an extra SP annuity for ~£900 what it would have cost me 23k on the open market. You run, not walk, towards that sort of proposition. Early retirees ought to be able to swing the Class II NI by declaring self employment and earning pin money. You don’t actually have to make any money, and you are usually in self-assessment anyway due to investments. I’d certainly say double check your working and I’d be intrigued as to how you come to that conclusion, assuming you do not have any reason to expect a shorter life expectancy than usual. @Pinch #7 > With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below Normal users won’t notice any difference and if your Kindle breaks you can register the replacement to your Amazon account and get your old stuff, barring rare edge cases. Amazon are doing this to stiff people who break the DRM’d books out of the digital rights management. So they can read the books on other ereaders or their computers. I will investigate alternative suppliers because I reject monopolist’s rights to control what I do with my stuff and my equipment. At any rate I will buy fewer books form them and favour secondhand real books, even if I give them away after reading. But it’s not a problem if you are a normal consumer 😉 @ermine – 14 Last I read was that making investments left you eligible for Class 2 NICs, regardless of earning pin money, or am I missing something? https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates talks about “people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission” @ermine Books… I’ve been giving Amazon the heave ho for quite some time. I mostly use World of Books, they operate on a circular economy model, and authors receive something on the sale of s/h books. I use the WoB website, rather than on Ebay. Cheaper that way. Thanks for the useful replies about NI contributions. I would reach SPA in 2046 (as things stand currently) and expect to have 25/35 years completed by 2033. I have the option to make class 3 contributions at slightly reduced rate for five missing years. If I can make class 2 voluntary contributions from 2033 then I should reach full record not long before I would be eligible to receive state pension. I was not aware that making investments for myself qualified for class 2 contributions, that changes the calculation enormously. There is always the risk that the system is changed somewhat by then but this seems the best bet for now. I’m surprised that there has been little or no discussion on Monevator around the talk of possible changes to the rules relating to cash ISAs and the possible reduction to a £4k annual limit. @Rob #18 >investments Yeah, but do make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes 😉 I’d be wary of using investments for that reason. Even if it were in your ISA it would be a pity to make your ISA taxable! You do need to register as self-employed for the year, and make sure it is the entire tax year. Being in self-assessment (SA) is not enough. Self-employment requirements are pretty lax. I once declared a £50 profit for running the PA for an event, that was enough. You don’t even need to make a profit to be self-employed. Sell something on ebay, but do not take the £1000 trading allowance in your SA form if you want to pay class II NI. Certainly agree it’s irrational to pay now if you will have 13 years post-retirement in 2033 to make up 10 years. All sorts of things can change in the next 8 years, you may need to work longer, or not, those 8 years the capital could be used to invest. The point I was querying is that compared to investment this was a poor deal – but it still makes sense to defer buying the years later where it makes no difference, you may as well use the money in the meantime! There have been rumblings about canning Class II NI since forever, the post-GFC coalition gov made a lot of noise about that and I was frightened of that disappearing in 2012. Never happened. There was talk of it post-covid as the Covid bung for the self-employed caused some reflection. Didn’t happen. Even at Class III rates it’s a steal compared to an open market annuity rate. Still worth keeping a watch on the space for rule changes. @ermine #20 > make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes I’d be wary of using investments for that reason If you are registered as a self employed investor (people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission) then you are on special rules where you have the option of paying voluntary class 2 contributions. But how would you calculate profit for class 4? My understanding of the rules is that in that category your profit is zero as you are not “getting a fee or commission”. Hence them giving you the option of paying voluntary class 2. If you had any profit to make you pay compulsory class 4 then the special regime would not be necessary. This is the same for example for another profession in that list of special rules, “ ministers of religion who do not receive a salary or stipend”. No salary, no profit, no class 4. @Grumpy Tortoise — We were on this ages ago, see the following post from early Feb and comments that follow: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-surely-not-cash-isas/ Returning to it would just be speculation and clickbait really. We’ll certainly cover it again if there’s concrete legislation, or solid confirmation! 🙂 https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual/nim74250 I’m not convinced FIRE style home investors qualify for class 2 ni , the discussion (tldr) on landlords seems to err on needing to begainfully employed on the activity rather than bring passive etc. Happy to be wrong I’ve got my 35. Means testing and country bankruptcy are my bigger concerns Class 3 is still too generous- perhaps Rachel will spot it Market mini crash mini special/Naughty corner Active Antics: 1). Verdad x 2: a). kurtosis + skewness so important, yet undercovered; b). Land of rising sun shows promise in SC space (overweight both Jap SC and Value, and looking for options for Jap micro/nano caps and SCV). 2). FT x 3: a). can’t see why investors would avoid UK SCs and ITs. There’s opportunity there. b). The big picture (5 yr+) on US large cap’s always looks good: https://www.tker.co/p/stock-market-performance-after-down-days But I’ve a bad feeling about this. The SPY and the S&P momentum index now both at/below 200 DSMA (latter for 1st time since 2023). With the orange emperor in charge and set on tariffs, valuations stretched, GPT 4.5 flopping, hyperscalars forgoing more power generation (a bad demand signal regardless of DeekSeek efficiencies): things looking less than rosy in the US large/mega cap space. A crash, if it comes, could be a good long term (decades view) entry point though. @Boltt #23 Thanks for that link, shame it only seems to be able to give landlording examples. I can see how managing a portfolio for you and your partner perhaps does not qualify as “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” unless it involves lots of active trading. But then I wonder what HMRC’s view would be on “a £50 profit for running the PA for an event” for a whole tax year. That can’t possibly be “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” either. @Delta Hedge — Well, the house Monevator view is of course “who knows”. Stranger things have happened than the market rallying on the back of an arsonist administration apparently wanting to bring back the 1930s quite wilfully, in terms at least of the Great Depression via tariffs and who knows what else besides. Maybe if the market sniffs out hyperinflation, though stagflation would seem likelier if they really do enact these announced tariffs and the same on Europe. That said BTCUSD seems to be giving up the ghost, and if the US market really was priced-to-perfection then it’s hard to argue that this is perfection, surely… @TI #26, first sentence second paragraph is perfection, like reading Evelyn Waugh (passages in bridesmaid) and thinking ‘wow, what a feat of language’… I enjoyed the link to Noahpinion for similar reasons.. We should hope for the big bear. The money is made in deep bear markets. That’s the opportunity to buy quality growth at an attractive risk to reward. AMZN split adjusted (1 share at May 1997 IPO @$18 = 240 shares at Feb 2025 peak @$225 each) hit $4.5 in Dec 1999 (~60x the split adjusted IPO of 7.5 cents), but could be had for just 37 cents in Sep 2001. Likewise PLTR went from $10 at Sep 2020 IPO to over $35 in Jan 2021 before falling to ~$6 in Dec 2022, after which it hit ATH a few weeks back of $125.41. *If* Trump now crashes the US economy then high beta tech should crater the most in the short run, even though (provided that stagflation is avoided of course) the lower rates eventuating from the contraction should follow IDC, thereby lifting all equity valuations, but most especially for high growth potential firms. Rather than going 100% in/out now, the wiser course (given that, as Peter Lynch liked to say, more money has been lost in trying to avoid the crashes than actually in them); might instead be to just stay invested broadly/ passively and, if there’s no crash, then do nowt; and, if there is a crash, then go buy up the deeply discounted high growth plays in expectation for the upswing (which might be 6 months, 2 years or a decade out, but always comes eventually, and is invariably longer lived than the bear market it replaced). @Bolt23 “Means testing and country bankruptcy are my bigger concerns.” I get what you mean of course but isn’t the state pension already means tested? For example, as it stands today, when I get to the date at which my state pension will due, I’ll quite likely be a higher rate tax payer, so 40% will go directly back to the state? Isn’t that the same as just reducing the state pension by 40%? For that reason, I suspect ‘actual’ means testing is less likely. I think an increasing component of peoples state pension will just have effectively 20% or 40% lopped off once any withdrawals from a private pension is taken into account. Particularly as inheritance tax changes, means you cannot pass it on. Seems reasonable. @Seeking Fire I have very similar thoughts about the state pension. Means-testing would lead to a lot of VERY angry voters – however the ‘financial drag’ by having ever more people dragged into a higher taxband will barely register. Have seen a few posts mention 35 years of NI contribution but did see Martin Lewis say that while its a not a bad rule of thumb it can go as high as 40 ish years for some especially if you contracted out of SERPS. I checked mine and i am 2 years short after 39 years of paying so it can vary by circumstance so always worth checking Re: class 2 NI: Tend to agree with the @Boltt (#23) interpretation. Although this HMRC forum is rarely that well regraded IMO this particular chatter tends to further back up his conclusion, see: https://community.hmrc.gov.uk/customerforums/ni/e8144d59-2df5-ee11-a81c-6045bd0d629d Re: means testing SP: The new SP is already means tested for salaried employees! It provides a flat rate payment but contributions are generally determined by your salary. In principle, a higher paid person pays in more than a lower paid person for the same pension. @Seeking Fire I agree – the State pension is effectively, partially, means tested by income tax. I’m working hard on avoiding HRT – retired early, max’s 2x ISA for 12 years, started draining SIPP, taking max tax free lumps etc. I will achieve a near 11% tax rate on the sipp over the next 6-8 years. Given the state of the country’s finances, and direction of travel, changes will come. £20k pa ISA allowance looks unsustainable (elitist), Labour could easily make it £5k pa and no new funds once the total is over £200k (pick any number between £100k and £1m, it isn’t many people and won’t affect votes too much) Taxation of pensioners is incredibly light v workers – a high earning well-prepared pensioner using ISAs could get to £100k pa income and pay just £7.5k in tax (£50k isa, £50k pension). A worker getting £100k gross (inc employers NI ) pays almost £39k in tax/NI- I had to triple check that number, it’s so crazy. Given our weak politician and insatiable appetite for free stuff there’s one place left to raid, and it’s us. On a positive note wealthy people are a hot commodity and other counties are fighting for our tax residency. Current number 1 slot goes to Cyprus – no IHT, CGT, tax on dividends, tax on interest and pensions tax less than 5% for 17 years. @Delta Hedge #28 > and, if there’s no crash, then do nowt; and, if there is a crash, then go buy up the deeply discounted high growth plays in expectation for the upswing The problem with this theorising is first shown in what do you do with the money that you would have applied to buying up the deeply discounted high-growth… in the event that there is no crash. Why do you have this large lump spare and why is it not in the market anyway given the nobody knows anything presumption 😉 The more practical problem is its corollary for most people, who in the second case follow > just stay invested broadly/ passively in which case if this represents a large part of their networth which is accumulated income, then they do not have unexposed reserves to fling into the bear market of the second case, it’s pretty much whatever they can spare from their earnings. I had the good fortune to be able to throw a large amount of resources into the post-GFC bear market because I came from a standing start. This is an unusual case. Say I rewind the tape 17 years from where I am now and assuming I were still working, my holding of VWRL would be thrashed in the GFC* and I would only have the free cash flow of my earnings, assuming I followed TA’s DNFS instruction. To buy into a bear market having just taken a large loss is tough. Even without that background I found it really hard. I have taken the free ride of the markets since the GFC, arguably I can eat a loss of 50% and it still will have been worth the effort. What about someone who started more recently and is nursing a real (hopefully still paper) loss? The theory is fine, but the practice not so much, a non-professional investor will probably only have earnings to commit to that bear market. Sure, they will realise a decent return on that part of their holdings, but they still have to wait for the larger part to return. Bear markets can last a couple of years, that’s a lot of rotten mood music and red ink to tolerate. I’m not disputing throwing a large packet into the bear market would be a wise path to take, but most won’t have a large resource to lob into the bear market, and there is also the philosophical argument that if you can’t call the top of a market you can’t call the bottom either, so even if you had that large resource, when do you go buy up the deeply discounted high growth plays. The practice is not that simple. I’ve also had the experience of throwing money into a bear market and it keeping on going down, down, deeper and down, and that really is the pits. Yes it was a good thing to do in hindsight, but that only came after a couple of years – pound cost averaging into a bear market is almost a worse experience that just sitting watching it sink and putting on your DNFS T-shirt. Perhaps that merch has been released at an opportune time 😉 *VWRL only started in 2012, presumably other world index funds existed @Boltt #33 > Current number 1 slot goes to Cyprus Is this the same Cyprus that levied a haircut on bank deposits of €100k in 2013? @klj I has a COPE (contracted out) adjustment of about £30 but still managed to get the 35 years in by about age 50- and starting full time work at 22. Three year’s free credits while at school (which was nice) – and there must be an element of earnings related credits in the calculations somewhere. I don’t want to ask in case they’ve make a mistake! So it looks like there’s upside for high earners, even if it’s temporary @ermine Yes, but avoid by not putting too much money in their Banking system. Hmm, perhaps that’s a risk here too in the future. Sorry @ermine #34. I didn’t explain myself very well in #28. So instead of x % in the market and y % on the sidelines, you stay 100% in the index tracker until a technical bear market (chosen index 20% off ATH or, if you prefer, 20% off 52 week high). You then sell some of the passive tracker to buy higher risk/return ideas. A growth stock with a beta of about 3 to the market is likely to go down roughly 50% on a 20% index fall (i.e. 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8). There are many more sophisticated versions to the above but in all you essentially set a max % of the tracker to sell in order to buy the stock etc, and restrict sales/buys to only when the index remains at least down 20% on ATH and/or the growth stock (or other alternative) is 50% down. One can (instead of a lump sum investment) DCA a set amount into the stock each week/ fortnight/ month that the 20% down on the index (or at least 50% on the stock) criterion remains in place. Again this is funded by selling some of the index ETF. Another possibility (especially if one doesn’t do individual stocks) is as above but, instead of going into one or more growth stocks on a discount, you do a 2x or 3x index LETF. Lower volatility indices are better here – so for example 3LUS LETF would be preferable to QQQ3 LETF. Long only equity index LETF performance is quite strongly negatively correlated with prior index performance – i.e. crap index prior performance often precedes very strong LETF outperform versus index. This approach can be refined to only sell the index ETF to buy the LETF when the additional criteria are satisfied that either or both the index has gotten (back) over the 200 DSMA and/or the VIX is (back) below 25. This helps mitigate volatility drag as the 200 DSMA is more predictive of volatility (higher below the 200 DSMA, and lower above) than price performance per se. Michael Gayed has a paper on SSRN on this and the Dual Momentum Systems website covers something similar in its LT (Long Term) Gain + and LT Gain ++ DIY strategies. Neither relies on market timing. Both are rules based systematic. @Delta Hedge @Ermine — My response to the (theoretically correct) notion of welcoming a bear market in order to go crazy risk-on was the same as @ermine’s. There’s no doubt bear markets are the business for new/young investors, or at least they always have been, because we’ve always recovered. But it’s a harder slog for older/deaccumulating folk. Hopefully of course there will be some defensive assets to sell and rebalance into equities in a big bear market. (Provided, say, you haven’t sold *all* your bonds because of 2022 cough cough. Though currently they’re moving a bit with equities too, though not this morning I notice…) Re-deploying stuff that’s not down into growth-ier stuff that’s been pummelled I can get behind for naughty active investors. It’s what I’ve tended to do since the GFC, though as I’ve noted before I screwed up in 2022. (Basically I did this strategy, but the growthier stuff kept falling, and I dialled it down at the worst time. My worse year ever really, not in absolute terms but I think in relative and ‘scored by the judges’ terms). Buying leveraged ETFs in a bear market is madness though IMHO, whether you’re passive or active. Personally I’d only buy those* in markets that were trending up, again whatever the textbooks might imply. It’d be a quite trip to the madhouse if the bear market continued after you bought, if not the poorhouse… *Actually I don’t currently use leveraged ETFs at all but I’ve read my @Finumus and I understand the theory. 🙂 Maybe with fun money they’re okay in a down market but not in any meaningful sense, unless one feels more lucky than wise… 😉 @Boltt 33, Feather-bedded pensioner here. Absolutely agree with your comments about taxation of pensioners vs workers. I’d also support all benefits being increased but made subject to income tax; that’s what should have happened to the Winter Fuel Allowance instead of the government’s crass own goal of a measure. An obvious start in redressing the generational tax imbalance would be to progressively reduce NI and increase basic rate income tax . This is the reverse of what has happened over the last 45 years: in 1978/9 tax rates were NI 6.5%, basic rate income tax 33%, VAT – 8%. NI rates peaked at 13.5% in 2022. @Delta Hedge #37 – Fair enough, I got hold of the wrong end of the stick of quite a complex strategy 😉 I will note, having managed to buy into a bear market having got a kick up the backside from TI that it doesn’t really matter what you buy when everything is slaughtered. The main thing is do it, do it now and keep on doing it. It’s also a tough game, the time for high complexity is not in the middle of that sort of fight, as the boxer said, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. But if you have the Zen-like detachment and the balls of steel, hey, go for it and the best of British luck to you! I do wonder if the time for that is at least visible in the distance. It never does any harm to ask yourself what will I do if anything, in a bear market. Putting on your new DNFS T-shirt is good, developing a complex wheeze is also good. If it goes well, then you get richer, if not, or you abandon your wheeze in the fog of war, well, you have learned something about your nature that you could not learn in any other way… @GOP Agreed. At risk of going off topic, middle (median-ish) earners don’t know they’re born from a tax perspective v other eu countries. Plenty of benefits and barely any tax. IMO we need to get close to – 1-Flat 35-40% tax on all income, no tax free allowance 2- UBI style flat allowance for all adults with 5+ years working history of around £80 a week. 3- no unemployment benefit (see £80 above), a max % of gdp allocated to pip/DLA and paid depending on severity of “physical” condition 4- limited housing benefit, no lifetime tenancies, social rents to be 80-85% private sector etc I could go on, but I’ll just be winding myself up (and probably some readers…) @TI #39: on LETFs, I’m landing with @Finumus in his first Moguls piece, so I’ll just: a). refer readers to that, and the many research links I left as @TLI (and as @DH) in the comments to that one ( 😉 ). b). Note the TL:DR from the research is only use LETFs wisely. You must have a system. Volatility drag is real, the idea of decay less so. Leverage low volatility asset classes and indices if you must, but never high volatility individual stocks. Less is usually more beyond 2x. Often 2x outperforms 3x, even with a decent system. The ideal Sharpes are from 1x to 1.5x leverage, but not necessarily the max CAGR chance. One needs to scale the position size down to reflect to leverage. This reduces the risk of catastrophic loss (as a % of starting portfolio) but still leaves open chance to outperform. Cases in point: a). $10,000 invested in USD NYSE listed QQQ ETF (1x NASDAQ) in 2010 would have grown to $120K (12x return) in Dec 2024. $10,000 invested in TQQQ LETF (3x NASDAQ) in 2010 would be worth $2.1 Million (210x return) by Dec 2024. So just 10% in TQQQ and 90% in cash B&H would have beaten 100% in QQQ both in return and in risk. b). LSE listed £Stg 3x NASDAQ equivalent QQQ3 went from £3 at launch in Dec 2012 to £238 in 2021, down to £50 in 2022, upto £280 this year and now £193. Those could be lucky timing with start and end dates (TQQQ would have been utterly annihilated in 2000 to 2002, for example, and for that matter battered in 2007-09 and 2022), but investing with some leverage when rates are low (so leverage is cheap, unlike now), or heading low (maybe), when markets have recently cratered (not yet) and are cheap (not now) does seem to tilt the odds. This boot strapped Monte Carlo research: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10157 suggests that going from 100% unlevered index ETF to 35%-45% 3x levered index ETF often increased performance whilst actually reducing overall portfolio risk. @Boltt #33: “Cyprus”: check out Italy too. 7% tax rate on foreign pension income available. Rural Sicilian, beautiful, under populated villages with 100 m2 (1,076 ft2) shell homes for €5k with generous grants to do up (cost typically €70k) or for €75k fully refurbished, renewed and ready to move in: https://youtu.be/-RGdwrymSas @Delta Hedge — Cheers but it doesn’t really matter to me what the theory is. I don’t want to be holding more than token amounts of a leveraged fund through a bear market. 🙂 Your illustrated returns are for Leveraged ETFs coming OUT of a bear market. That’s great! Now do 2007 to 2009 and imagine holding them (or even adding to them) as they cratered. Really *feel* it. I say this as somebody with a high fortitude for volatility and plenty of experience of not (net, over the course of decline) bailing out, buying into the face of further falls, and whatnot. From memory you bailed in the 2009 crash? Not a dig or a criticism, just an observation. There’s probably a lesson in there. For me the lesson might be not to add leverage to the mix, at least not until there’s some strong signs that the market has turned (e.g. moving decisively above 200-day MA though that’s hardly foolproof etc 🙂 ) But as always absolutely NOT personal advice, every reader is 100% going to have to make their own decisions etc, you do you. 🙂 @Boltt #33: Re your SIPP d/down @BRT: UFPLS, or max PCLS plus flexible drawdown*? FWIW, I went latter route and my only possible regret was that I did not draw to the top of BRT band** each and every year. I am almost through flattening my SIPP (in percentage or monetary terms) – but squeezing out the final remnants of the erstwhile SIPP/DC [at BR] is going to be quite the palaver and will certainly take another few years; assuming it can be done at all. Never saw that coming! OTOH, the removal of the SIPP IHT wheeze should probably mean that this once rather niche pursuit [flattening a SIPP] will be much more widely discussed. A lot can (and almost certainly will) happen over your indicated timescale. I initially tried to optimise (ie minimise) tax paid rather than focus on speed of emptying. With 20/20 this was probably a mistake. Take a few minutes and try and recall what has happened since 2017/18 tax year! *11% figure may hint at the former, but just wanted to be clear; **which, from experience, is an awful lot easier said than done if you have any other sources of taxable income, and especially so if they are rather variable in quantum. Oops, Meant to say: *11% might hint at the latter … Totally agree. I’d never suggest being levered going *into* a downturn save the interesting case (which we’re not talking about here) where it’s a capital efficient product where the leverage is only used to gain exposure to hopefully negatively correlated risk off assets like bonds (e.g. WGEC ETF holds 90% unlevered DM equities and uses the last 10% to get exposure to the equivalent of 60% bonds via rolling three month futures). Once the market has crashed though – to the extent that equities *unambiguously* look cheap (eye of the beholder I accept) – as they did in 2009 (and perhaps as late as 2012/13 for tech) – then the odds change (perhaps massively) and using some outright leverage on the risk on side can help. I bailed after Bear Sterns went bust in early 2008 b and IIRC, the market then went up all that summer. Although staying out seemed to work from September 2008 to March 2009, at the bottom things snap back fast and hard. The best days often follow the worst. So when do you actually buy back in? It’s just impossible. In the end you only capitulate and buy back in (as I did in 2013) when prices are higher than you sold at. You just can’t win that way. Now it is true that 2009-21 was *very* begin for using leverage for equity indices. One can’t use that period as a template. And it’s also correct (recalling what I can where people have tried to simulate) that if TQQQ or QQQ3 LETFs had existed then (they didn’t, the first 2x LETF was launched in 1997 IIRC) that they would then have gotten whacked 99.8% down from the March 2000 (then) peak through to the end ot 2002. You can’t recover from that. But if you’re a cautious investor and looking to preserve starting capital then putting 10% into an LETF and holding the remaining 90% in risk off when things have crashed, but where an up trend is in place (either 12 month positive absolute momentum or above the 200 DSMA) and where volatility had fallen (VIX or VIXN below 25) is not so crazy as it might otherwise seem when it means only risking that 10% of the starting value in circumstances where there’s a big enough asymmetry that it is not implausible that you could ultimately end up with more than with 100% in an unlevered equity position (as happened from 2010 to 2021 with 10% in UPRO and 90% cash versus 100% in SPY). Granted that the Sharpe and Sortino ratios on this are poor, but it’s CAGR that we get to eat in terms of buying power, not risk adjusted returns. Position sizing is the key IMHO. The art of execution and all that. If you size right you can eff up and still survive. But it also helps enormously to have a system with preset parameters for when you will and will not venture further up the risk scale. Sorry the formatting on that comment screwed up. Hopefully it still makes sense. @A1Cam #45 Agree, many others were keen on keeping the Sipp (iht) and using the ISA during the gap (Rhino comes to mind) – I/we were more interested in tax efficiency when alive rather than when dead. Makes a nice change to have backed the right horse (I’m not bitter much about s&p500 and my 0% allocation!) My plan is to hit £50k pa to squeeze the value out of the 20% band – savings and rentals now mostly in my wife’s name (well beneficial interest) so my income is pretty well known and I may wait until March every year just in case) You have previously suggested deferring my DB by a couple of years – this is my current plan as it empties the DC (more or less) and LTA rule no longer bites. The other major consideration is how to make real life use of a large ISA – I will stop contributing in a few year (no non-isa Funds left). I think 6-8%pa drawdown seems sensible, use it while you can or the kids will. Looking at my parent and in-laws they simple don’t spent much. FiL is accumulating with less than £250 a week coming in! * 11% works both ways, but yes max PCLS @Boltt (#49): Yup, I am pretty content with my SIPP decision* – the alternative approach you mention would have left my SIPP [in due course] as “a 100% hostage” to HRT. Yikes!! TBH, I have yet to address the what to do with the ISA Q – but worth noting only your wife can inherit it tax free, and not your kids. FWIW, I think this whole SIPP saga is very much a case of “a bird in the hand”. Recognise your March proposal. FWIW I have tended to kick things off a bit earlier as my erstwhile SIPP/DC was/is slow to process w/d’s. I kicked off my first one ever in the Jan of the year in Q with plenty of h/room to HRT. IMO until you have tested this path out you have no idea how slow/quick it really will be – and beware all glossy marketing puff stating how quick/easy it is to draw from a SIPP. It is NOT! I ended up taking my DB earlier than initially planned – and that is primarily why I now have such a protracted tail to flattening my SIPP at BRT. And in spite of all this fandango-like fancy footwork, fiscal drag has well and truly got me. Barring something akin to “a miracle” I will be a HRT payer again once my SP kicks in! So my SP will have been means tested during accumulation and will be HRT taxed in payment – but still IMO pretty good VFM**. Ho hum. P.S. I reckon if you do UFPLS to c. 50k the income tax is a tad under 10% with a full standard personal allowance. * whilst I had no need for that IHT wheeze, I never believed it would survive ** but just nothing like as good as it used to be @Curlew — Sorry for the delay, I was away for a long weekend / anniversary type thing so comment moderation was more of the ‘is anything on fire?’ variety this weekend. Yes it doesn’t seem to be possible for me to fine tune email settings and membership. The system basically assumes you want emails if you’re a member, and you don’t want any emails if you either (a) don’t want member emails but prefer to read on site or (b) don’t want regular emails but do want member emails. Your position is not common, fortunately from my POV! 🙂 Most of the problems are people who at some point marked a Monevator email as spam, perhaps by accident or perhaps because they didn’t like some particular topic and thought this was helpful feedback (it’s 100% NOT because of the following…) which basically gets their email flagged as a no-no for receiving any more emails from us. (Basically a GDPR / email provider thing, they don’t mess around.) Then because they actually liked us all along they’ll become members, but they don’t get the emails, and I have to unpick the above. A few members don’t want emails. If I get a chance when things quieten down I’ll see if there’s some plug-in or workaround. But honestly your system is probably as good as any. Like I say thankfully most people want emails. 🙂 The number of readers who read via email and never visit the site is now multiples of on-site readers most days. S&P 500 down a further 3.5% today. TSLA down 15%……, so far today. Looks like US downturn gathering pace. @Trufflehunt #52: I don’t like to kick a man when he’s down, but it’s hard not to think of the irony of Musk – with everything that he’s become now – being down so many tens of billions because, in all likelihood, of the policies of the very monster whom he so helped to get elected. At the same time, the investor/opportunist in me wonders where the bottom might be and at what price below which DCA’ing into TSLA might be attractive given the seemingly ever receding but not vanished prospect of FSD, the growth of the energy division and the possibilities of Optimus. If you’re a shareholder, then it seems far too late to sell, and if you’re not then far too early to buy. But perhaps a price point will emerge where it’s attractive. Only a year ago it was $160, so it’s still up since then, despite being close to 55% down in short order from the ATH. @DH, @TI, @ermine: Interesting chat. IMO anyone holding excess cash may consider using [some] of that cash to try to “buy the dip”. However – and FWIW – using leverage in any form of such an opportunistic [buying] strategy looks well dodgy to me! @Al Cam: It’s likely, IMO, more attractive, if one were to redeploy capital from unlevered trackers into higher risk, to then do so into potentially oversold single name blue chips or arguably higher quality high growth smaller caps than into leveraged index trackers. Volatility drag/constant leverage trap is a huge issue whose implications may outweigh the picking winners issue with single names even allowing for Bessembinder etc. However, if leverage is ever going to work well then it’s going to be on the rebound from a crash. Since 2021-22 the clearest example of the possibility for successful rotation into oversold blue chips might be Meta. From $379 in August 2021 to a mere $93 in October 2022, and then up to $740 only a few weeks ago, and now showing $600 in the pre-market. Current P/E is 24 which means that in October 2022 one could have in effect brought the current earnings on a P/E of less than 4. Possibly a risk worth taking. Preference shares up 8% this morning – interesting, will S&P go pop later today? Sub 400 would be nice. @Delta Hedge Tbh, you sound more like a day trader than an investor. @Trufflehunt #57 hahaha 🙂 Seriously though, an index is made of companies. Some good. Some bad. Some in-between. One can’t like the index but not it’s constituents taken as a weighted whole. Bessembinder shows the top 0.25% by performance of companies globally (from 64,000 firms 1990-2019) or 0.3% in the US (from 26,000 firms 1926-2016) accounted for 50% of the entire excess returns over T-Bills. Buy and hold just one winner, brought for the ‘right’ price and, given enough time, there’s tremendous asymmetry. And you only need small exposure, and time, to make a difference. AMZN up 3,000 times (with splits) from the 1997 IPO until this most recent market turbulence being a prime example. Just 0.5% allocated at IPO, and the rest in a global tracker, and it would still transform overall portfolio performance. The paradox of Monevator is you have an ostensibly passive promoting site where @TI invests actively. There are many ways to win. I try and keep an open mind to all of them but actually I’m fairly cautious. If anything I’m too cowardly on allocations in practice. But everyone’s mileage varies. I’m fortunate to have a generous DB pension that’ll give me £37k-£38k in present value terms at 60 in about a decade. I should get the full SP at 68. And just before the recent turmoil I’d gotten up to £1.17 mn in ISA/SIPP (although down plenty since) with around £100k in GIA (increasingly for holding gilts) and £200k in cash savings and premium bonds. The mortgage is paid off. Mrs DH’s financial’s are not so far behind, if one accounts for a larger DB accrued. We have no kids. Frankly, I can afford to take risks. Maybe that does put me on a par with a day trader or a degen gambler, but I like at least to think not 😉 It’s true I’m still overwhelmingly in equities but it’s also still overwhelming via plain vanilla trackers. At some point for me though, certain individual shares could, perhaps, become attractively priced and, for me, a buy. The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets, even when some of it is your own, and all that. And when that time comes, if it does come, to buy those shares then they’ll be plenty of headlines about why it’s a terrible time to buy, of that I can be sure. @DH (#55, #58): If (and only if) you can pick the winners ahead of time then that is clearly the way to go; the numbers are clear. I know this also from experience as (over the years) I have had a couple of very good individual shares – but it is notable that they both also had significant problems en route too. Also, and probably most importantly, in both these cases my good fortune was far more luck than skill! IMO you are very well set up for the future and I would view your interest as more of a hobby with play money – which you can well afford to lose. Not everybody is so fortunate though. Good to chat. @Delta Hedge #58 I’m not a passive investor but the obvious riposte to Bessembinder shows the top 0.25% of performers globally (from 64,000 firms 1990-2019) or 0.3% in the US (from 26,000 firms 1926-2016) accounted for 50% of the entire excess returns over T-Bills. is that this is presumably why when I list VWRL the top 10% of holdings are the Mag 7, which so far have been the big hitters of late. Indexes self-select the winners, the losers get ignominiously booted. All without any need for smarts on the purchaser’s part. I get all the theory. Sell your beaten up indexes in the darkness before the dawn, and buy sharply focused growth. Axiomatic to that strategy is that you can see both signals in the noise – where is the point of most significant darkness, to within 5%, say, and what does future growth look like? You’re looking to shoot straight for the what, say a 1 in 400 target implied by your 0.25%? In the heat of a bear market? I salute your stable position. Agreed you can afford to screw up. But tawk is cheap, as Nassim Taleb’s NYC taxi driver said in Antifragile. Going through a bear market is a bloody awful experience particularly when you have a significant existing holding which you have. If there’s one thing I have learned in a couple of decades of investing, it is yes, in bear markets there is money to be made, but doing so is hard, very very hard. It is possible that we are on the threshold of a suckout, or perhaps it will be a flash crash like the one last year. It’s always possible to see with hindsight what you should have done. But investing in a bear market is mainly about self-mastery – If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs. You don’t have to be a skilled stockpicker in a bear market, the bear mauls pretty much everything, the flipside is valuations are improved including for indexes. The DNFS T-shirt is apposite – the first rule if you can’t see what to do is Do No Harm -DNFS. As it was I didn’t follow that instruction, but whether the resulting good fortune was skill or luck, well, damned if I know… I’m not convinced that a highly tuned strategy is optimal for most of us in a bear market, while absolutely respecting you do you. God knows I’ve tended to overthink things far too often, but really, a bear market is a mosh pit, finely tuned delicate strategies easily get mauled in the bunfight. Bear markets are noisy, the good gets hammered with the bad and the ugly. Finally, there’s the obvious question. You’re clearly a very bright fellow and positioned well. No kids, paid down mortgage, decent stash. I am reminded of Warren Buffett’s sage words about the good people at LTCM and the pity quote “Whenever a really bright person who has a lot of money goes broke, it’s because of leverage” Good luck, but in the interests of the rest of us the point should be made that leverage is Kryptonite in investing, as Keynes didn’t say, the market can remain irrational for longer than you can stay solvent. @DH (#58): I assume your DB projection requires you to work until you are sixty? In any case, given the size of your SIPP it may be smart (at least tax wise) to jump ship earlier than 60 (with a presumably reduced DB) and start emptying the SIPP, before starting your DB and then SP. Apologies if we have discussed this trade-off before. On the opportunity point, I actually reduced my massive US underweight today by adding a small amount of Mag 7 back via the Allianz Tech Trust (ATT). It’s down 20% in a month. Zero confidence this is the bottom — in fact I think lower is probably more likely than higher for the foreseeable — but these remain quality companies, and if the AI trade blows up then ex-nVidia hopefully the capex will go down too. (Microsoft is already scaling back). The price isn’t outrageous for the quality here IMHO though the growth is slowing. But still very massively underweight to be clear. Just also always trying to be humble, within the constraints of thinking I can beat the market long-term haha. (Definitely not advice, DYOR, remember as a naughty active investor I do trade a lot and could be out of this by tomorrow AM though that’s not the plan at all). I don’t disagree with a word of what you’ve written there @ermine, and I hope I don’t come across like that Mick fella with his Australian mining minnows in the comments from a couple of years back 😉 And everything you say is all very true, but it might not be the whole picture. If you only ever invest in the index then you’ll only ever get the index return less fees. Adding a small amount (%age wise) of direct holdings will cause variance to the index. That can can be good or bad compared to the index performance over the same period. But it will not be the same. The worse it can be is a wipeout on the individual shares. The best is uncapped. Bessembinder’s winners’ returns drive the entire market. Many manage to average (albeit with inevitable massive drawdowns) 20% + p.a. over decades to go up 100s of times. Cap weight trackers capture some of that late phase when the companies in question are massive. No so much before then, and not at all before they get listed in the index. It could (quite plausibly reasonably) be said to be a fool’s errand to try and pick the winners at all. On the other hand, at some point it perhaps becomes clearer which are the winners and, when they’ve sold off deeply without the fundamentals adjusting downwards to the same degree, then there’s arguably some risk arbitrage there. It’s impossible to know where the bottom is so don’t try to time. Instead decide in advance the max %age allocation to any individual shares (it might be 5% for example) and the price below which you will DCA and the amount you will invest per month until either a) the share in question trades over the price point you chose to begin buying or b) your chosen %age allocation to the share is reached, whichever happens first. In any event, I definitely wouldn’t lump sum something like this. @Al Cam – Good point on State Pension. It’s effectively means tested on the way in through varying contributions and on the way out through taxation. Stock market falls are just a minor minor flesh wound looking at one & three year performance and not of the Monty Python variety. You need to be comfortable with significant volatility from here. It’s been low vol for a while. US valuations are still mega stretched. If you have a significant portfolio already, I think all this talk about positioning into a bear market is for most people absolute rubbish. You are unlikely to have much cash lying around to make a difference. If equities are cut in half, for many people, their job will be at risk. At that point you are hunkering down, slashing costs, trying to ride it out. Sure if you are 30% in cash go for it. Mostly likely you’ve been like that for years and are well behind anyway. If you are just starting out – good news. It is incredibly hard to leverage up, deploy any cash safety net if you have kids and a mortgage to pay. If not well then go for a blow out. DH has got no mortgage, no kids and a DB pension in 10 years – the perspective is completely different to the average punter. For me, I’ve worked out a roughly sustainable withdrawal yield based on my portfolio’s earning power. Given income is generally more stable, I told myself, I had no increased spending power when equities went up, equally now they are falling, I’m not particularly worse off. It’s not quite accurate but assists. @SF (#64): Thanks; I have been making this point for years and IIRC you are one of (if not the) first person to acknowledge it @M. There are many other much more subtle issues associated with the new SP (NSP) system vs the old SP system. The most obvious of which is that the NSP has no spousal death benefit. The others [that I am aware of – and I am sure there are others that I am not aware of] are generally more subtle and often quite complex. A phrase regularly used by HMG prior to introduction of the NSP was “that there will be winners and losers”. I was definitely on the losing side, and in spite of @Boltt’s comment (#35) above, I suspect he will also be in my team – as he has effectively surrendered all his additional state pension contributions. @SF (#64): P.S. did you mean to say “so do not deploy any cash safety net …” or similar? Also, if my experience and acquaintances are anything to go by, there might be quite a few retirees out there with excess cash and I am not sure how you get fired as a pensioner. IMO, there are an incalculable number of scenarios in play. S&P 500 on the slide again this late (UK) afternoon. Looks like investors unimpressed with the scenario of Trump petulantly doubling down on tariffs against Canada, being unconcerned about plunging stocks and prospects of recession…., whilst offering support to his pal Musk, to prop up the share price of TSLA. Not a great look. Never mind, there’s always Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Gulp. Do you think this might be connected with the mad idea of the Donald that Canada could become a 51st State (at least 80% of Canadians oppose strongly, and it’s hard to get 80% of any population to agree on anything these days)? I shudder to think what a MAGA attempt at an anschluss for Canada would look like. Hopefully no worse than a bungled farce that goes no further than failed economic strong arming. But you can never tell how far people like Trump might try and go. @DH. As much as I would love to see Elon and some of his Trumpy-techno-fascist-bros lose it all, I think we might be putting the cart before the horse. The recent drop in the Nasdaq 100 has made it as far back as … late Sep 2024. The gospel according to US retail is BTFD (buy the fckin dip). We need that to fail. The Fed put needs to fail. The Trumpster will throw the kitchen sink to keep it up. That needs to fail. The whole techno-bro “AI revolution” needs to fail. In 2008, the US found out it had banks that were TBTF (too big to fail). Now, the whole US stock market is TBTF. In South Africa, under the deeply corrupt President Zuma, the word used to describe what we are seeing evolving in the US was State Capture. Drop any pretense that you are investing according to some weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. This is so much more than just a corrupt financial system. The political imperative from the current administration is for it not to fail, or, to be precise, for it not to fail until a time of their choosing. When it does fail, I wouldn’t bet it will be bounce up in two or three years. If it cuts through all the above, then I suspect it will stay down for a very long time. @ZX: Where Trump differs from at least any post Warren Harding Presidency (if not long before) is that, unlike Nixon (who is unfairly tarnished by a comparison) Trump does his dirty work out in the open. He has no shame. It’s deeply disturbing: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/richard-nixon-donald-trump-and-breach-faith It’s no exaggeration that Trump is evil. That much has been clear since when he mocked reporter Serge Kovaleski’s chronic joint arthrogryposis condition at a South Carolina rally in 2015, if not earlier. How much value should be attributed to the companies of a country in the midst of – if not of a moral collapse – then a moral subsidence. Markets, economies and companies are successful in open and principled societies (the democratic tradition) or ones where there is at least instead a coherent and vaguely sensible long term plan (Chinese syncretic market Leninism). Trump is an agent of chaos and, I fear, of multiple forms of decline. It will be miraculous if he catalyses a techo-accelerationist success. It’s such a long shot.

Title: The great climate deception: How the environmental movement was hijacked by elites

The modern climate change narrative originated with the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. Despite the IPCC's influence on global climate policy, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals have signed a declaration stating there is no climate emergency. Critics argue that the climate has always been changing due to natural cycles, citing the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 as an example. They point out that there is no statistical evidence linking global warming to intensifying natural disasters and that the IPCC's models have significantly over-predicted warming. Policies like the UN's Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement, aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, are seen as potentially harmful to the global economy, particularly for developing nations. The push for a "green economy" is viewed as a means for central banks and mega-corporations to consolidate wealth and power. The environmental movement, once focused on genuine issues like pollution and deforestation, is portrayed as having been co-opted by powerful elites. Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement.

Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement. For decades, the world has been told that human activity, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is driving catastrophic climate change. The United Nations has sounded the alarm, warning of impending doom unless drastic measures are taken to reduce CO2 levels. But what if the narrative weâve been fed is not only exaggerated but fundamentally flawed? What if the real environmental movement has been hijacked by powerful interests with ulterior motives? According to a growing chorus of scientists and experts, this is precisely what has happened. According toÂ Mark Keenan, a former scientist, there is ampleÂ evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no âCO2-inducedâ Climate emergencyÂ and he shares some of it in his new book, titled âClimate CO2 Hoax â How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement.â The origins of the climate panic The modern climate change narrative can be traced back to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The IPCC was tasked with providing scientific advice on climate change and formulating response strategies. Its first assessment report became the foundation for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has since shaped global climate policy. However, not everyone agrees with the IPCCâs conclusions. In fact, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals from over 30 countries have signed a declaration stating that there is no climate emergency and that the UNâs claims about man-made climate change are unfounded. Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.

According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain. Sources include: ClimateDepot.com GlobalResearch.ca Amazon.com According toÂ Mark Keenan, a former scientist, there is ampleÂ evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no âCO2-inducedâ Climate emergencyÂ and he shares some of it in his new book, titled âClimate CO2 Hoax â How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement.â The origins of the climate panic The modern climate change narrative can be traced back to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The IPCC was tasked with providing scientific advice on climate change and formulating response strategies. Its first assessment report became the foundation for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has since shaped global climate policy. However, not everyone agrees with the IPCCâs conclusions. In fact, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals from over 30 countries have signed a declaration stating that there is no climate emergency and that the UNâs claims about man-made climate change are unfounded. Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.

According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain. Sources include: ClimateDepot.com GlobalResearch.ca Amazon.com Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.

Title: Prof Aoife McLysaght: ‘Mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic and brave advice’

Aoife McLysaght recalls how she heard about her first job in genetics. It was the summer after second year in Trinity College Dublin, and she was working in her father’s wholesale nursery in Blackrock, Co Dublin. “Everybody worked there, including me”, starting with filling pots with soil from an early age. “I remember my sister running out into the nursery and going, ‘There’s some professor on the phone for you’.” McLysaght had apparently impressed genetics professor David McConnell in a problem-solving exam, and he offered her a summer research job. Turned out this involved learning about, then designing, a bioinformatics course, using computers to analyse biological information, then a new field. “It became the thing I ended up really loving and working in, basically computational biology.” She’s now evolutionary genetics professor at Trinity. But what tickles her, “the mental connection”, is that that day when her sister ran out, “I was sowing sweet pea”. Peas are critical to genetics. By crossing pea plants, the Austrian scientist Gregor Mendel “basically figured out what genes are, how things are inherited”. While “you can’t unmix paint”, red-flowered and white-flowered parent plants can beget pink, red or white flowers. [ Summer of sweet peas: the struggle is worth itOpens in new window ] This week, ahead of today’s International Women’s Day, An Post launched two new stamps to acknowledge the achievements of women in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) and the challenges they face. One features McLysaght; the other has astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell. In January, McLysaght started her new job as Government science adviser. New science advice structures, department-based – Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science – for the first time, will inform responses to complex and challenging policy issues. It’s a “60 per cent secondment” from Trinity, where she’ll pause teaching and administration but continue research. She’s led a research team there since 2003, managing €5.5m-plus budgets. As a student in 2001 she was part of the international consortium publishing the draft human genome sequence; she was first discovering novel human-specific genes in 2009, identified links between gene duplication patterns and human disease, and has significantly contributed to our understanding of genomes. Based at the department three days a week, at assistant secretary general level, she’s assembling a new national science advice forum of experts to provide advice. Continuing research is important (or “you lose momentum, you lose touch with the field”) and the 60/40 split is considered a good model for government science advisers, so “you retain your independence. You don’t become a civil servant who’s interested in promotion. You’re not in any way incentivised to please the people around you.” Today we’re sitting by the fireplace of Trinity’s gracious Common Room. She gestures to ”Liz” looking down; a portrait of England’s Elizabeth I. This university is her turf since she was an undergrad (graduating in genetics in 1998, PhD in 2002), aside from a postdoc in University of California, Irvine. She’s full of knowledge and enthusiasm, humorous, easy, insightful, likable. She laughs a lot. “I’m the one who never left college.” She grins. Arriving in Trinity, “I felt very quickly I’d found my place”. Genetics’ department culture was and is “very supportive and welcoming of students. We were just treated as people who were earlier in their career. You’d have these really good interactions and conversations with the professors. That’s very motivating.” She describes professors, undergrads, post-grads and post-docs mixing in the building’s atrium, eating lunch, chatting. International science adviser counterparts tell her “the relationships are so important”. She observes “as a scientist or an academic, you might think you’re going to convince people because of this amazing data. You’ll just whip out a graph, and they’ll go, ‘wow, now I see it’. But actually, what’s more likely is you’ll convince them because they trust you”. Having a foot in both civil service and academia is interesting for her. As an academic she’s hired for “the knowledge and discretion and insight to choose” what to teach or research. “In academia, the huge privilege we have is to follow your curiosity.” Civil service involves more procedures “for very, very good reasons”. In this new world, “I’m sitting in on management meetings, business planning meetings, and I’m constantly impressed by the amazing people around me” with vast knowledge, and “very good at knowing how to be effective in getting something done, at reading people, picking up on the slightest things, that I was in the room for but didn’t notice”. The department’s new unit comprises McLysaght and a principal officer. “He’s like my subtitles in every conversation. He’s helping so much in figuring out how to structure things. “I took on this job because I want to do something interesting and meaningful with it, not because I needed to fill my time. I had a full-time job, which I really enjoy. The first line of my application was: I love my job.” A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing Her paternal grandfather, genealogist Edward MacLysaght, died aged 99 when she was 10. She recalls him sitting in the garden, “his beautiful books”, the photo of him with de Valera on the mantelpiece, and his trick holding a coin between his eyebrow and cheek (“we’d roar laughing”). Her grandparents lived in “a little house, basically up the back of the garden in Blackrock” and a relative, barrister Charles Lysaght, told them he’d died, then “rang The Irish Times and RTÉ. Minutes later I heard it on radio. I thought this was normal.” Theirs was not a science family. “I never knew a scientist. I didn’t know you could be a scientist.” But it was her favourite school subject, fuelled by teacher Nick Frewin at Andrew’s in Booterstown. Looking back, she realises, within “the rather constrained Leaving Cert curriculum, he managed to emulate one of the joys of science, which is figuring things out.” She enjoyed genetics, because it involved “understanding principles and figuring things out, rather than remembering stuff. Labelling the parts of the eye. That’s just dull. Genetics was exciting, because it was about ideas and concepts.” She worried about jobs. “My mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic advice, isn’t it, and very brave advice.” These days, talking to school groups, especially girls, “I’m not in the business of persuading anybody to do something they don’t want to do. Science worked for me. It doesn’t mean it’ll work for somebody else. All I want to do is let people know the door is open, if they care to walk through it. That’s all I needed.” There’s a perception she was young to be appointed full professor in 2020. But she was 44, “older than many of my male colleagues”. She was, however, youngish becoming assistant professor at 27; she laughs about managing “to straddle that ambiguity of, is she a student or staff?”. She spells out the startling drop-off of women before reaching academia’s higher levels. Biology doesn’t have the “systemic stereotyping” of maths, but even there, while women comprise 50 per cent of undergraduates right up to postdoctoral research, getting top grades, the percentage of women drops as soon as you get “steady conditions, no longer precarious employment”. She says “too many people thought it was a legacy problem that would fix itself over time. They were kind of passive about it.” She married in her 20s, had her first child at 28, within a year of assistant-professorship, “when I should have been knuckling down and impressing everybody! I didn’t do the correct career thing.” She laughs. “I don’t know if I’d call it a gamble, but I decided, my life decisions and career decisions are separate.” It helped that academic careers are “judged in the round. Are you getting your job done? You organise your own time”. As science adviser, “I don’t want to give the impression I think nobody uses evidence and I’m coming in to save the day.” But she foresees “smaller cultural shifts” in better integrating evidence into decision-making, making it “more habitual”. Climate change has “the most urgency, and the longer we leave it untackled, the more urgent and bigger the challenge.” It’s cross-government: “it’s energy, agriculture, transport, skills and education. All infrastructure.” McLysaght is fascinating company, knowledgeable beyond her speciality and about the bigger picture. She chats away, fired up. “I can keep you here for 10 hours, if you have the time!” We’ve moved and are looking out over Trinity’s Front Square. She talks about her “fortuitous” involvement in the genome project, how “we knew it was something momentous, we were part of the team that was analysing the human genome first”, and the significance of discovering genome duplication in human ancestors 500 million years ago, thus creating “this extra capacity for enormous diversity” and with implications for human health. [ Gene editing opens door to new treatments for inherited retinal diseasesOpens in new window ] McLysaght stresses “scientists are human beings. Of course we can make mistakes. People think scientists know everything. Of course we don’t. We just know a lot about a very narrow thing. People think science is fixed, never changes, but actually we’re always updating it”, what a friend calls “trying to be less wrong than yesterday”. And while scientists can have “reasonable and plausible disagreement”, when there isn’t 100 per cent certainty on detail, “we know the extent of our uncertainty”, and there are “discussions and disagreements, constantly moving closer to the truth. You can categorically say, this is untrue, while not being 100 per cent certain of something else within that.” While this concept can be confusing, it’s important for trust in, and public understanding of, science, she says. The false assertion that vaccines cause autism is a good example. “It’s been thoroughly investigated. It is absolutely not true, thoroughly debunked.” But it “created mistrust in vaccines, which have been extraordinarily powerful in eliminating and controlling very significant childhood diseases.” Australia has eradicated cervical cancer because of HPV uptake. “A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing.” [ ‘Extremely impressive’: melanoma jab trial results excite doctorsOpens in new window ] Talking about science is important, she says, “so people understand how we know things, and what you do when you’re trying to develop new scientific knowledge. You don’t just build something and hope it works. There’s steps and investigation along the way. We are our own first critics. When I’m trying to demonstrate something, the first thing I try to do is disprove it. “What I’m interested in is that things work well, that science is valued as part of decision-making. What I’m not interested in is any kind of personal recognition. It’s more important to me that this thing is done and done well, than anybody getting credit for it. I don’t think I have a big ego. Maybe everybody does somewhat, but it’s not what motivates me.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Mayo women winemakers: ‘Everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a bit more’

From Ballyhaunis, Roisín Curley celebrates 10 years making wine in Burgundy this year. She still works part-time as a pharmacist in the family business. “I have one foot in Burgundy and one in Ballyhaunis” she says. “I love both. I spend August to November in France and visit every month too.” In 2023 she made 14 different wines. “I am a workaholic and I love it.” She says she also has “a spinal cord of loyal close family and friends who help make it happen”. Did she find it difficult as a woman and foreigner to be accepted in Burgundy, a very traditional winemaking region? “I thought it would be a challenge, but everyone has been so nice and so helpful. Being a woman, it is harder. But everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a little bit more.” Formerly a sommelier in top restaurants straddling three continents, during lockdown Brigid O’Hora moved from Dublin to Achill Island with her young triplets where she began her hugely successful Bridey’s Wine Chats profile on Instagram. Last year her book The Home Sommelier was published. “Our family home is in Achill, so I have been going down there since I was a child. To be honest, I tired of the rat race. We were originally here for six months to save for a house but after three months something in me said ‘no, I’m staying here'.” “I fell pregnant and that’s when I started online. I now work with an importer but I’m still doing my own stuff promoting the book and doing Instagram. It keeps me in touch with everyday people, which is what I love.” Originally from Co Down, Sinéad Cabot moved to Westport 20 years ago. Since then, with her husband Liam, she has been running a firm of wine importers in Mayo, while growing grapes and making critically acclaimed wine in Slovenia. “I’ve worked in wine for 25 years: from retailing to importing to winemaking in Slovenia. I can start the day wearing wellies in the vineyard and end it by wearing high heels at an event presenting our wines. It’s a great life. As well as a certain amount of physicality, winemaking calls for intuition, multitasking and a holistic approach – things we women have in spades.” Like many people, Maureen O’Hara didn’t set out to pursue a career in wine. “The closest connection Killala has with wine is that French ships landed there in 1798. At the last minute, I chose a business degree rather than home economics teacher training. I think part of me wanted to see the bright lights of Dublin. [ ‘She has an amazing nose’: Ireland’s female sommeliers on the changing industryOpens in new window ] “I was a marketing manager for many years. Wine courses gave me confidence dealing with customers and suppliers. In 2010, I set up Premier Wine Training. One aspect I really enjoy is food and wine pairing. My initial love of food and teaching has come together. “I love the fact that wine education empowers people to do their job well. Students have gone on to run wineries, write wine articles, and everything in between. When I set up Premier Wine Training, some were sceptical that I could earn a living from it. Wine education is stronger now than ever. I could do more but would need a suitable partner.” Sinéad Cabot: “A wine that both energises and soothes. A broad palate of preserved lemon with shimmering acidity that finishes with a salty lick which just makes me … well, thirsty.” From The Wine Grove, Castlebar; Daróg Wine Bar, Galway; 64 Wine, Glasthule Brigid O’Hora (coincidentally this was one of my “best value” wines of the year choices): “So mineral, so mouth filling I love it; I adore it.” From Blackrock Cellar; Lilith, D7; Whelehan’s, Loughlinstown; 64 Wine, Glasthule; Green Man, D6; Baggot Street Wines; Pinto, D9; Martin’s, D3; Jus de Vine, Portmarnock Maureen O’Hora: “My favourite wine depends on what I’m eating, but Castelnau de Suduiraut Sauternes, a super ‘second’ wine from a top estate, is a real treat with desserts.” From Celtic Whiskey Shop, D1; The Vintry, D6; McHugh’s, D5 Róisín Curley: “A pure red fruit expression of strawberry and raspberry nuanced with spice and hints of forest floor on the lingering finish. The acidity is bright and fresh, and the tannins are typically silky. It is showing beautifully right now. Each time I have tasted it recently it has been an absolute delight.” From Redmonds, D6; Pinto Wines, D9; Mitchell and Son, D1, D2; Sandycove; Green Man, D6; thenudewineco.ie; Baggot Street Wines; Gibneys, Malahide; Deveney’s, D14; Drinkstore, D7; Eldons, Clonmel; Jus de Vine, Portmarnock; Sweeneys, D3; theallotment.ie Exclusive competitions and restaurant offers, plus reviews, the latest food and drink news, recipes and lots more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

March 07, 2025 19:58 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Marshall Is. CL YINGDU oil/chemical tanker transits through the Miraflores Locks at the Panama Canal, on the outskirts of Panama City, Panama December 18, 2023. REUTERS/Roberto Cisneros By Elida Moreno and Marianna Parraga PANAMA CITY, March 7 (Reuters) – The Panama Maritime Authority, which oversees shipping and port infrastructure in the country, will request all legal and financial documents from a key transaction between CK Hutchison and a consortium backed by BlackRock, minister to presidency Juan Carlos Orillac said on Friday. U.S. BlackRock announced this week that a group of investors, including Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment, agreed to buy most of the port business of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals under a 25-year concession. The maritime authority is expected to analyze the transaction, which gives control of the two ports strategically located near the Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, at the cabinet’s request, to ensure that public interest in the terminals will be protected, Orillac added in a release. A separate audit of CK Hutchison’s port concession, which was renewed in 2021, is yet to be completed by Panama’s Comptroller General office. The CK Hutchison-BlackRock broad deal involves the Hong-Kong firm’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. Some U.S. lawmakers have said that CK Hutchison’s control of the Panama ports represents a security risk that might jeopardize the Panama Canal’s operations, backing up President Donald Trump’s threat on taking over the waterway, which was returned by the U.S. to Panama in 1999 under a neutrality treaty. The ports are not part of the canal nor needed for vessels to pass through the interoceanic way, which is mostly used by ships departing from or heading to the U.S. The Panama-owned canal is operated by an autonomous entity, while Panama’s Maritime Authority oversees the ports and Panama’s vessel registry. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, following the deal. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said Trump was “once again lying” in a social media post on Wednesday. “The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed … the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!” The head of Panama’s business chamber Consejo Empresarial Logistico, Daniel Isaza, said the CK Hutchison-BlackRock deal might encourage the expansion of port infrastructure in Panama. “The administration of the Balboa port opposed the construction of other ports in the Pacific and introduced multiple lawsuits that halted the construction of the Corozal port,” he said. “A new administration capable of making new investments to increase port offer is positive for the country.” (Reporting by Elida Moreno and Marianna ParragaEditing by Marguerita Choy) Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

Title: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds

The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

By Sherisse Pham Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings sold its Panama ports business to a group of investors led by BlackRock. What does this episode tell us about Hong Kong today? JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: A Hong Kong company that operates ports on both ends of the Panama Canal said this week that it had agreed to sell its business there. CK Hutchison announced it had a deal with a group of investors led by a U.S. company. The sale looks like a win for President Trump, who has repeatedly stated that he wants the U.S. to reclaim control of the Panama Canal. Reporter Sherisse Pham has more from northwest Hong Kong.SHERISSE PHAM: I'm here at CK Hutchison's Logistics Center in Kwai Tsing Container Port, one of the busiest container ports in the world.(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)PHAM: I see miles and miles of goods and shipping containers and trucks. Everything is stacked like LEGO pieces, ready to be boarded on a ship and transported around the world.But this week, the company announced that it's selling the bulk of its ports business to a group of buyers led by BlackRock. Among the assets being sold - two ports operated by CK Hutchison in the Panama Canal that had come under fire by the Trump administration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.(APPLAUSE)PHAM: That was President Trump on Tuesday. He earlier accused China of operating the Panama Canal, an unfounded claim. Beijing called it, quote, "pure lies." CK Hutchison maintains its operations are strictly commercial.The company traces its roots back to when Hong Kong was under British rule. It was founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing, who's now 96 years old. CK Hutchison is a sprawling international conglomerate, operating everything from retail shops to telecommunications.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Life needs a big network.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LEAN ON ME")BILL WITHERS: (Singing) I'll help you...(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Three.PHAM: The company had operated ports for decades, but it was an opportune time to exit a business that had come under geopolitical pressure, according to Dan Baker, senior analyst with Morningstar, a U.S. financial services company.DAN BAKER: My view is, if you get a really good price for it, why not?PHAM: Morningstar estimates Hutchison's ports business was worth about $10 billion. The company sold it to the BlackRock group for nearly double that.BAKER: Given there has been, as of just recently, some geopolitical concerns with some of those businesses - particularly the ones in Panama - they're probably worth more in the buyer's hands than they are in Hutchison's hands.PHAM: But George Chen, Hong Kong managing director of the D.C. consulting firm The Asia Group, argues that CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports business in Panama is a blow to Hong Kong's reputation as an independent financial center.GEORGE CHEN: On one hand, I think it shows, you know, Li Ka-shing - you know, he's a businessman, and he treats this more as a business decision. But on the other hand, I don't think the deal really makes Hong Kong looks good.PHAM: Chen says CK Hutchison striking this deal so quickly indicates Hong Kong companies nowadays really can't afford to get caught up in geopolitical storms. In a statement, a CK Hutchison spokesperson says the deal is, quote, "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports."(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: CK Hutchison enters the dawn of a new season, building on a firm foundation of its past.PHAM: Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison once had the best of both worlds, operating in a freer financial system separate from Communist China while still having easy access to China's vast markets. But after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the region has increasingly been lumped together with Mainland China. Even this deal, analysts say, appears to reflect that lack of distinction.CK Hutchison is now selling dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, but it isn't exiting the business entirely. It will continue to own and operate ports in just two territories, Hong Kong and Mainland China.For NPR News, I'm Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Title: Uranium is in the crosshairs of the US-Canada tariff battle

Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. by Justine Calma If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats could raise the price of uranium used to fuel US nuclear reactors, which could have ripple effects on a tenuous nuclear renaissance spurred by the growth of energy-hungry data centers. The US gets more than a quarter of its uranium from Canada, more than from any other country. The Trump administration imposed new tariffs on uranium and other goods on Canada this week, which he soon paused after a stock market drop and sell-off. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply It’s too soon to know what the exact impact would be on the US’s nuclear energy industry if tariffs move forward. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply, which has gotten bipartisan support and interest from major tech companies. But in the near term, the US still relies on its northern neighbor to keep reactors running. Trump proposed a 10 percent tariff on energy products from Canada, but he announced yesterday that it would be paused until at least April 2nd. Canada-based Cameco, one of the world’s biggest uranium producers, warned that the tariffs would inevitably lead to higher prices. “It’s kind of Econ 101 to figure out what the impact of tariffs are in this situation,” Cameco CFO Grant Isaac said in a February 20th earnings call. A 10 percent tariff would lead to a 10 percent rise in uranium prices, Isaac said, whether that’s from Canada or elsewhere. “History tells us non-tariff countries will simply increase their offer prices to just under 10 percent,” he said. When reached for comment this week, a spokesperson for Cameco said Isaac’s comments on the call still hold. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in Washington, DC, was coy when asked about how the tariffs might affect the US nuclear energy industry. “We agree in principle that actions should be taken to unleash America’s energy dominance and protect our national security, while also creating a robust economy that spurs job creation. However, these measures could hinder growth and innovation in the energy sector and the nations’ ability to achieve energy dominance,” Doug True, senior vice president of technical and regulatory services and chief nuclear officer, said in an emailed statement. Uranium prices have risen dramatically in recent years, with growing interest in nuclear energy — including from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta seeking out nuclear energy to power new AI data centers. Higher uranium prices incentivized the resurgence of uranium mining in the US, with the first mine to open in nearly a decade starting up near the Grand Canyon last year. The Russia-Ukraine war is another factor, with the Biden administration banning uranium imports from Russia, another major supplier, last year. “Why are we dependent on foreign nations when the US has the capability, has the resources, has the technology to actually become energy independent, especially in nuclear?” says Jay Yu, president of LIS Technologies, a US-based laser uranium enrichment company. But even if the US builds up its domestic supply chain, it’s still constrained by geography. The US only holds about 1 percent of the world’s uranium reserves, while Canada holds about 10 times as much. “Tariffs would threaten uranium supply at a time when the United States is seeking to expand its nuclear dominance,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a late January analysis. The emergence of DeepSeek’s AI models in China, which can ostensibly use much less energy than US rivals, has also made the future of data center energy use and nuclear energy more uncertain. Nuclear energy is still a touchy subject that’s created some strange bedfellows. Unlike coal and gas power plants, nuclear reactors don’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That’s put it on the table as an alternative to fossil fuels that some climate hawks champion. But someone has to mine the uranium for those nuclear reactors, which some environmental groups and Indigenous activists are fighting fervently. The US has a history of uranium mines contaminating water resources on Navajo Nation land. Trump, a big fan of the fossil fuel industry that dumped tens of millions of dollars into his campaign, has essentially tried to eradicate action on the climate crisis in the US. He could carve out exceptions for nuclear energy technologies that have garnered support from extractive industries and Big Tech. He tapped Chris Wright to lead the Energy Department; Wright was previously the CEO of a major oil and gas service provider and sat on the board of directors for a company developing advanced nuclear reactors with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Uranium sits at the nexus of many different power plays in the US, and tariffs could raise the stakes for everyone with something to lose or gain.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Is Oversold

ByDividend Channel ByDividend Channel , Contributor. The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. JPMorgan Chase presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors. 10 Oversold Dividend Stocks » But making JPMorgan Chase & Co an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of JPM entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $240.55 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, the RSI reading has hit 28.5 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 43.7. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, JPM's recent annualized dividend of 5/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.03% based upon the recent $246.54 share price. A bullish investor could look at JPM's 28.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on JPM is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Title: Stock investors are hovering near a make-or-break level in the market
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-danger-zone-sp500-200-day-moving-average-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-07T15:40:14Z

The stock market has entered the danger zone as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 hover near their 200-day moving averages. Both indexes are trading at the key technical support level after a 6% decline in the S&P 500 and a 9% sell-off in the Nasdaq 100 since mid-February. The 200-day moving average is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend. When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend. The Nasdaq 100 closed below its 200-day moving average on Thursday for the first time since March 2023, while the S&P 500 tested the level multiple times this week for the first time since October 2023. As of Friday morning, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,728.90, just a few points below its 200-day moving average of 5,732, while the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 20,056.35, below its 200-day moving average of 20,246.83. It's a potentially make-or-break moment for the stock market as traders assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. According to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies, the S&P 500 needs to stage a decisive bounce above this technical level to prevent further downside. "Our short-term indicators suggest it will act as a staging ground for a brief oversold bounce," Stockton told clients in a note on Friday. "Nevertheless, a close below 5,783 today would leave a breakdown pending confirmation next Friday." Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told Business Insider that he wouldn't be surprised if big-money buyers started to enter the market. "These longer-term trendlines can be used by institutions to buy up shares, so we'd expect to see some type of potential buying down around here," Detrick said, adding that this correction in the stock market is perfectly normal, especially after the back-to-back years of 20%+ gains in 2023 and 2024. "We remain overweight equities and would use it as an opportunity to accumulate solid companies at a discount. After gaining 20% two years in a row, some consolidation early this year makes a lot of sense," Detrick said. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted in a note this week that an index that equally weights the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks — Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla — is also trading at its 200-day moving average. If it falls below the threshold, it would suggest investors should look elsewhere for leadership in the stock market. "A violation of the 200-dma would imply that the Mag Seven's leadership status has been revoked," Turnquist said. For David Keller, chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, traders should be on watch for a more painful decline in stock prices. Keller told BI that a confirmed breakdown below the 5,700 level in the S&P 500 would suggest that the index could test support at 5,500, representing potential downside of about 4% from current levels.

Title: Lancaster County residents, businesses feel the pressure of high egg prices

Two pastors sitting in a sunny window booth were contemplating a serious question: eggs or no eggs? Angelo Rodriguez and Wendell Yorkman met for breakfast on Monday at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township. On the front door, a sign told customers a $1.50 upcharge would be added to any egg dish, due to the high cost of eggs. Yorkman was debating whether to get pancakes instead. “But then I remembered, my friend was paying,” he said. Rodriguez usually adds a third egg to his breakfasts, but this morning was weighing the upcharge. He recently went to pick up a few groceries for his daughter and looked at the price of a dozen eggs. “It was $8.75 and I said, you know what? She’ll be all right,” he said. Dr. Wendell Yorkman, of Mountville, left, and Pastor Angelo Rodriguez, of Lancaster, chat over breakfast at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Local restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores are feeling the heat from rising egg prices aggravated by the ongoing avian flu outbreak that has taken a toll on the nationwide egg supply. As businesses scramble to keep up with soaring costs, consumers are left to decide if they are willing to spend extra for a breakfast staple and ingredient in many favorite recipes. One booth over from Rodriguez and Wendell, Robyn Weidner said she hasn’t been going out to breakfast as much because of price increases. Even at home, she’s eating less eggs. She was eating a lot of them as a source of protein while she’s in training for a half-marathon. Now she’s turning to other high-protein alternatives like oatmeal and chia seed pudding. “I'm not going out and spending $7.99 on a dozen eggs, I can guarantee you that,” Weidner said. “I'm a single mom, so absolutely not, no way.” READ: Trump opens the door to exempting eggs from tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico READ: Egg prices could jump 41% this year, USDA says, as Trump's bird flu plan is unveiled The average price of one dozen eggs nationwide has risen 96% from $2.52 in January 2024 to $4.95 in January this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that’s just an average. What Lancaster County residents are seeing can be much higher. Avian flu is a factor. In January 2022, before the outbreak started, one dozen grade A, large eggs cost $1.93 on average, nationwide. In its most recent egg markets overview report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service said there are still inadequate egg supplies because of the ongoing avian flu outbreak, but there are signs the situation may be starting to improve. The USDA said the pace of the outbreak is slowing and the national egg inventory rose slightly at the end of February. The USDA said bird flu outbreaks in commercial table egg layer flocks in the first two months of this year resulted in the death of 30.1 million birds, 74% of which lived in conventional caged systems and produce the most common eggs that hit grocery store shelves. Following is the average price of a dozen grade A large eggs in the United States from January 2024 to this past January: Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Pennsylvania egg production during January totaled 681.8 million, a 4% decrease from the same time last year, according to the USDA. The state’s population of layer chickens was 6% lower in January, compared to the previous year. Since Feb. 6, more than 136,000 birds in Lancaster County have been affected by avian flu, according to the USDA, but none of them egg layers. Pennsylvania lost 1.9 million laying hens in Dauphin County and more than 85,000 in Lebanon County in early February. Shannon Powers, press secretary for the state Department of Agriculture, said the Shapiro Administration is working to keep costs down for consumers through a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Recovery Fund, which helps farmers increase biosecurity measures and recover losses. She said the state’s investment in testing and a coordinated response to outbreaks also help farmers minimize the cost to their operations and protect against future harm. Powers said Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation in egg production and first in organic egg production. Eggs and other poultry products fall among Pennsylvania’s largest exports, worth $155.6 million. Many factors determine the cost of eggs, Powers said. “Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. Any negative changes to international trade could impact poultry farmers and the price of eggs,” she said. READ: Here's how Pa. is handling the latest outbreak of bird flu in Lancaster County The Pancake Farm owner Javier Camacho said prices are affecting his business. He said customer traffic is down around 25%. Camacho decided to add the $1.50 upcharge to egg meals a few weeks ago to deal with volatile prices, which he said was a hard decision. “Prices are changing every day,” Camacho said. “If we place an order today and a dozen is $8.25, tomorrow will be $8.75 a dozen.” Camacho said the restaurant uses up to 190 dozen eggs per week. He doesn’t want customers to think he’s using the eggs as an excuse to bring in more money; he said he has to think of his employees and business costs. The upcharge doesn’t apply to every meal. The pancake batter contains eggs, but pancakes don’t get the upcharge because, Camacho said, “they are our main thing.” A price increase on pancakes would be “devastating,” he said. Keith Thompson, of Reading, types in the table information so Marshmellow the mechanical helper knows where to take an order of poached eggs and chipped beef at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Not everyone at The Pancake Farm is concerned. Most diners still have plates of eggs in front of them. “If I need eggs, I buy eggs,” said Nancy Sarley, who had just ordered poached eggs. “I'm just happy to wake up in the morning, I'm not looking at dirt, I’m not worried about the price of eggs,” said David Sarley. At Quarryville Family Restaurant, managing partner Andrew Morgan is torn on how to handle the price of eggs. The restaurant goes through 300 dozen of them per week. He hasn’t changed prices in about 10 months, he said, because he doesn’t want to upset his customers. A meal of two eggs, home fries, toast and bottomless coffee is $5.50 at the restaurant. “We have an awesome group of customers who are very loyal, who say, ‘you got to do what you got to do.’ But we also want to provide value for their hard-earned dollar,” Morgan said. An old purchase order put the issue in stark perspective for Morgan. He said the order shows he paid $31.39 for 30 dozen eggs three years ago. Today he is paying $250.59 for the same amount. “That’s a 700% increase,” he said. READ: Would tariffs hurt Lancaster County businesses, consumers? Here's what we know Brad Milliken, of Lititz, had a breakfast of bacon, eggs and hash browns at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. While grocery shopping, customers have to decide how important eggs are to them. At the Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, Kami Miller of Rothsville put one dozen eggs in her cart. “One dozen, that’s all I can afford,” she said, laughing. Miller said, since she moved to Rothsville about a year and a half ago, she’s watched the price of a dozen eggs jump from $1.99 to $5.99. She said she never really watched egg prices until now, and she’s been baking a lot less because of it. Larry Kauffman of East Lampeter Township wasn’t bothered much by the price. He said he always keeps eggs in the house. “I hate to see what they’ll be by Easter,” he said. Frances Eberly of Lititz glanced over the egg display before pushing her cart away. She said she had some eggs at home, so she didn’t need to buy more. Plus, she has a source outside the grocery store; a friend with chickens will sell her a dozen eggs for $3. “I guess if I needed them, I would pay that price,” she said. Eberly said eggs are in so many baked goods that she has cut back on baking because of the price. Scott Petersen, dairy manager at Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, stocks the egg display at the grocery store on Monday, March 3, 2025. Jordan Snader, a partner at Dutch-Way, said the market’s relationship with a local farm lets them keep a steady supply of eggs at a better price than some competitors. One dozen large white eggs were on sale for $5.99 as of Monday. Snader said customers are changing their patterns as egg prices rise, but he said they generally understand that it’s a nationwide problem. Some customers have turned to specialty eggs over commercial white eggs. Dave Dietz, produce and dairy manager at Lemon Street Market in Lancaster city, said it’s been a little challenging to keep eggs in stock. He said egg sales are up 40%-50% over last year. That’s likely because the market has high standards for eggs, Dietz said, usually offering pastured and organic varieties. Prices for specialty eggs haven’t jumped as dramatically as commercial white eggs. For example, Eagle Road brand brown, large eggs from non-GMO fed, pastured hens are priced at $5.49 per dozen, the cheapest eggs at Lemon Street Market. Prices range up to $9.99 per dozen for Alderfer brand brown, jumbo, organic eggs. READ: Middle Creek visitors must change their plans this snow geese season It’s one thing to skip eggs for breakfast. But eggs are a critical ingredient in many baked goods. Laura Wu, co-owner of Hello Mango Asian Bakery in Manheim Township, said she can no longer afford eggs from the wholesale company she was working with. Now she’s hunting for eggs at Costco, Restaurant Depot, and farm markets. It’s not just the price. “It is also difficult to find more eggs,” Wu said. “Everywhere has limits.” The bakery has had to raise prices by $2 for a 6-inch cake and $4 for an 8-inch cake. Wu said she is hoping prices drop in the spring. Erica Wolgemuth-Johnson is experimenting with using less eggs in some of her products at Erica Joy Bakes Gluten Free Creations in Lititz. She has experience baking without eggs; her shop specializes in vegan treats. “I was joking the other day that we’ll just go fully vegan,” Wolgemuth-Johnson said. But she said there are egg-heavy recipes that she will keep, because she created the recipes, like her honey-almond-lavender cake. She hasn’t raised prices so far, since gluten-free products are already a little more expensive and she doesn’t want to price people out. Wolgemuth-Johnson is avoiding making egg-heavy bakes for the shop’s display case. “I’m not going to make it just in the hopes someone comes in and buys it,” she said. Success!

The Trump administration believes a renewed emphasis on biosecurity can help in the battle against bird flu and ease egg prices. The Agriculture Department predicts the current record prices are going to get much worse this year. It’s also not clear how much more farmers can do to keep the virus out. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins offered the first new details about her bird flu plan Wednesday. The USDA predicted this week that egg prices will soar more than 41% this year on top of the record average price of $4.95 per dozen.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The tariff fight is far from over

Happy Friday! If you're grabbing an Uber or Lyft this weekend and a Tesla shows up, do yourself a favor and don't bring up Elon Musk. Whether you love him or hate him, chances are your driver doesn't want to talk about it. (And if you insist on doing it, they'll probably just say what they think will get them the best tip.) In today's big story, tariffs against Canada and Mexico have been mostly delayed by a month in yet another turnaround in the ongoing trade war. What's on deck Markets: One betting market has the odds of a US recession at 32%. Tech: Microsoft is talking up a massive quantum-computing breakthrough. Amazon execs aren't buying it. Business: Some senators want to take a closer look at X's advertising tactics. But first, another postponement. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. So, about those tariffs… Two days after implementing a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods, President Donald Trump is pulling a U-turn. The president announced a one-month pause on tariffs for both countries' imports that fall under an agreement called USMCA. If you're a bit rusty on your global trade regulations, USMCA was the trade deal that Trump negotiated between the US, Canada, and Mexico to replace NAFTA. The trade pact covers most goods, making Trump's announcement almost equivalent to the monthlong pause on tariffs he initiated in February. The offer didn't extend to the other target of Trump's tariffs, China, which has issued retaliatory tariffs. There's long been speculation that Trump's tariffs were merely a negotiation tactic to get better trade terms from other countries. And the president's willingness to issue another reprieve from his trade taxes could be proof of that. But the market's willingness to accept the ongoing uncertainty might only extend so far. Investors are already on edge as fears of a potential recession start to bubble up. Stocks rebounded on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted a resolution to the tariff situation could be coming. But despite the official announcement on Thursday, stocks finished down considerably. The S&P 500 closed 1.78% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.61%. Trump's flip-flopping may not pay off in the long term. That's according to supply chain and conflict resolution scholars, who said his tariff tensions are eroding the US's relationships with its allies. Things aren't likely to calm down in the meantime. The February jobs report comes out this morning. It will help inform the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on March 19, which is less than two weeks away. And the fight over tariffs is far from over. Canada and Mexico's postponement is only until April 2. That also coincides with the kickoff of more tariffs. This time they're targeting foreign agricultural goods and other products. Trump also mentioned South Korea, India, and the European Union over what he said were unfair trade relations. There's no shortage of experts weighing in on what it all means. If you want to sound smart about the Trump tariffs, here are some of the best thinkers to follow. Sorry, American firms, the AI trade has moved to China. 1. Economists and betting markets agree: Odds of a recession are rising. The chance of a US recession jumped to 32% on Thursday on Polymarket, up 23% from late February. Wall Street economists say the reason is Trump-shaped — the administration's unpredictable policy moves could shake consumer confidence to the core. 2. Inside "Project Voyage," Goldman Sachs' grand plan to thin its ranks, cut costs. In addition to moving the bank's annual culling of underperformers up the calendar, CEO David Solomon plans to relocate employees from New York City to lower-cost areas like Dallas and Salt Lake City, people familiar with the program told BI. One former employee said Project Voyage is a multi-year plan, and you can expect these divisions to be the most impacted. 3. How much do investment bankers really make? As Wall Street waits to see if a dealmaking rebound will fully materialize this year, recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners heard from over 900 investment bankers on how much they earned in 2024. Check out some of the survey's highlights. 1. The petition to standardize closed captions. BI's Katie Notopoulos has a bone to pick with streaming services: Captions are too hard to figure out. Every streamer has a different interface, posing a challenge for the 63% of Americans under 30 who prefer subtitles. Maybe you're swiping up, but what if it's actually down? Perhaps you accidentally click the dreaded "Play from the Beginning" button in the process. She thinks it's all too much, and it's also an accessibility issue. 2. Amazon calls BS on Microsoft's quantum-computing claims. In an email to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon's head of quantum tech expressed doubts that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum computing chip could do all it was hyped up to do, according to a copy of the email obtained by BI. Industry experts said tech companies might be generating more hype than substance in their attempts to outdo each other in the field. 3. The shortcut for cheap AI. Distillation — using one model to improve another — has more potential today than ever, thanks to the plethora of open-source models that can serve as "teachers." While some developers celebrate the concept, the big AI companies behind foundation models need to justify and protect their pricey offerings. 1. These senators want an investigation into Elon Musk's X. Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Adam Schiff, and Chris Van Hollen are calling for a DOJ probe into X. Specifically, they want to know if X is leveraging Musk's political status to pressure companies into advertising on the social media platform, referencing an article from The Wall Street Journal article last month. Read the letters they sent to the DOJ and the FTC. 2. Playing dress up with an AI twist. Fashion app Doji uses AI to help users virtually try on clothes, and early beta testers are loving it. One fan is none other than Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who's also backing it through his venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. 3. Social Security employees can't read news sites at work anymore. As the Trump administration continues restructuring the Social Security Administration, a recent agency-wide email announced new browsing restrictions for employees' work computers. Restrictions prohibit workers from checking the news, online shopping, and visiting sports sites. According to the email, the goal is to limit risk and protect sensitive information.

While a short-term technical rebound was observed, the broader downtrend remains intact. OPEC+ Production Hike Adds to Bearish Sentiment OPEC+ surprised the market with its decision to raise production quotas for the first time since 2022, adding 138,000 barrels per day (bpd) to supply starting in April. While the increase is relatively small, traders are wary that this could be the first step toward unwinding the group’s larger production cuts.

Some analysts believe political motivations may be at play, with former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly favoring lower oil prices. This shift in OPEC+ strategy has forced traders to reassess supply expectations, adding to volatility in crude markets. U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory Measures Threaten Demand Growth New U.S. tariffs on Canadian and Mexican crude oil imports have injected further uncertainty into the market, exacerbating fears of weaker demand. The U.S. imposed a 10% duty on Canadian energy exports, with reports suggesting it may soon be lifted for select products. Mexico’s status remains unclear, adding another layer of concern for Gulf Coast refiners who rely on Mexican crude for blending. China, another major oil consumer, responded to U.S. tariffs by increasing levies on American agricultural products and restricting U.S. company operations. The escalating trade war has raised concerns about slowing global economic growth, which in turn could reduce energy demand. Goldman Sachs warned that while tariffs do not directly impact crude prices, they create headwinds for economic activity, dampening industrial fuel consumption. U.S. Crude Inventories Build as Refinery Demand Softens The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed a larger-than-expected build in crude oil inventories, with stockpiles rising by 3.6 million barrels last week. The increase was largely attributed to seasonal refinery maintenance, which led to lower processing rates. Refineries operated at 85.9% capacity, down from the previous week. Despite the rise in crude stocks, gasoline and distillate fuel inventories declined, suggesting stronger refined product demand. However, the broader inventory trends reinforce concerns that oil markets are still oversupplied, particularly in light of additional OPEC+ barrels hitting the market in April. Geopolitical Risks Remain, but Demand Concerns Dominate While geopolitical risks persist, their impact on crude prices has been overshadowed by bearish fundamentals. Reports suggest the White House may ease sanctions on Russian oil exports following a shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. If sanctions relief materializes, it could further pressure oil prices by allowing more Russian crude to reach global markets. Meanwhile, the U.S. has ramped up sanctions on Iran, aiming to curb its oil exports and disrupt its economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that Washington is reviewing all existing waivers that provide Iran with economic relief, signaling a more aggressive stance. However, analysts believe spare capacity in the market could offset any supply disruptions from Iran, making demand-side risks the greater concern for oil prices. Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures Trend Indicator Analysis The main trend is up according to the weekly swing chart, however, momentum is trending lower with the market trading on the bearish side of the 52-week moving average at $71.23. This is new resistance along with a pair of pivots at $69.53 and $70.78. The downside momentum indicates traders have their eyes on three key bottoms, $64.75, $61.58 and $59.52. Weekly Technical Forecast The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending March 14 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to $71.23. Bullish Scenario A sustained move over $71.23 will signal the presence of strong buyers. If this creates enough near-term momentum, we could see a possible retest of $72.32. This move will be difficult to achieve from current price levels, which means the market is in a bearish position. Although it won’t create a bullish scenario, per se, a steep plunge int $64.75 to $59.52 could bring in the bottom-pickers, which may fuel a strong short-covering rally. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under $69.53 will indicate the presence of counter-trend sellers. The weekly chart indicates there is plenty of room to the downside with the first target $64.75, followed by $61.58 and $59.52. Market Outlook: Further Downside Risk with Limited Upside Potential The crude oil market remains biased to the downside, with multiple headwinds keeping a lid on price gains. OPEC+ supply increases, ongoing trade tensions, and weak refinery demand have reinforced bearish sentiment. While a short-term rebound was observed, technical resistance is likely to cap any sustained rally. If crude prices break below key support levels, further selling pressure could accelerate, exposing lower technical targets. Unless a major bullish catalyst emerges, such as a significant demand rebound or a shift in OPEC+ policy, traders should expect continued volatility with a bearish tilt in the near term. Technically, light crude oil futures are trading on the weakside of the 52week average $71.23, which should be enough to call it bearish. Our work suggests the market is headed toward $64.75 to $59.52, where aggressive countertrend buyers could be waiting. We could be nearing the liquidation phase of this current selloff, which means we could see freefalling prices into the former support levels at $64.75, $61.58 and $59.52. The cause of any steep liquidation next week is likely to be “margin call” selling. During a massive break in the stock market, hedge funds are often forced to liquidate other positions to meet the market call. Crude oil could be one of those markets that they sell.

Title: Elon Musk's wealth tanks by $102 billion in 2 months as Tesla stock hits the skids

Elon Musk's net worth has tumbled by $102 billion this year following a sharp decline in Tesla stock. That figure is about the same as the United Parcel Service's entire market value. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has shrunk by about 24% in under 10 weeks to $330 billion at Thursday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is still comfortably the world's richest person, with a roughly $108 billion lead over second-place Jeff Bezos, despite being the biggest wealth loser this year. He's well ahead of Michael Dell, whose net worth is down $20 billion. Musk's fortune has been hit by a 35% plunge in Tesla's share price this year, from about $404 to $263. The sell-off has cut its market value by more than $400 billion to under $900 billion. Investors have dumped the automaker's stock for several reasons. Musk spent more than $250 million to help Donald Trump get reelected, stumped at the Republican candidate's rallies, and marshaled his X followers to vote for Trump in November's election. The tech billionaire has remained a close advisor since Trump's victory, spearheading efforts to streamline federal spending with his White House DOGE office. The combination of his divisive politics, concerns about his new role distracting from his CEO duties, and reports of Tesla sales declines in several countries have weighed on the company's shares. Several other members of the $100 billion club have taken a hit to their fortunes from the recent slump in stocks, which has been fueled by worries that Trump's tariffs and government cuts will cool economic growth or even cause a recession. Oracle's Larry Ellison has had $19 billion wiped off his wealth, reducing it to $173 billion. Similarly, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Amazon's Bezos have each had about $17 billion erased from their respective net worths this year. Bezos is now tied with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on $222 billion; Zuckerberg has added $14 billion to his wealth in 2025, while the Amazon founder has shed almost $17 billion. Jump to

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software.

Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood.

Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: STEVE FORBES: Truth or consequences: what happens when businesses end DEI

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Target is the latest in a string of retail giants who have taken a stance against the wildly unpopular diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs afflicting corporate America. Target’s move comes in the wake of similar action by other big-name companies, including Meta, Walmart, Amazon and Tractor Supply Co., which have all scaled back their DEI policies in recent months. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. Walmart investors recently sent a letter to company leadership applauding them for rolling back their anti-business DEI policies and encouraging them to maintain their position despite far-left pushback. TARGET FACES 40-DAY BOYCOTT FOR ROLLING BACK DEI INITIATIVES Indeed, DEI policies and force-fed corporate moralism have been wildly unpopular with the American public since their inception. When Tractor Supply’s DEI policies came to light last year, they drew massive attention on social media and inspired customers to boycott the company, resulting in an 8% decrease in its stock price ($2.8 billion in market loss) over just five days. Continued exposure of corporate DEI programs caused other large companies like Ford, Google and Lowe’s to preemptively shut down their policies and avoid similar backlash and financial loss. Target said it is taking aim at DEI, one of several major companies to do so. (Google Maps) Additionally, large companies have faced consistent warnings of potential legal action from state attorneys general, private organizations and shareholders over what amounted to discriminatory DEI hiring practices in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2023 Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College (SFFA) decision. And back in 2016, when Target first announced its bathroom policy allowing customers to use restrooms based on gender identity, it triggered a massive backlash and boycotts. They could not have been more out of touch with the American public. These efforts, as well as the larger campaign by angry DEI supporters to "blackout" Amazon, Walmart, Nestle and other large corporations, represent just how far the Democrat party has come from reflecting the views of the American people. Even their own pundits and politicians agree. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently blasted the comical DNC Chair election and went as far as jabbing at DEI, which he described as often "making people sit through a training that looks like something out of ‘Portlandia.’" Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner also admitted that his party’s "over-the-top-wokeism" has hurt their political prospects. Longtime Democratic Party strategist James Carville lamented his party’s self-destruction over essentially meaningless, in his words "stunningly stupid," policies, including the Democratic National Committee’s woke gender rules implemented in February. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. And former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently decried the Democrats’ approach to dialogue with the public, noting how detached they are from everyday citizens and the issues that matter most to them. The truth is corporate moralism has damaged American consumers, and they know it. DEI, alongside environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, have unnecessarily raised the prices of energy, food, transportation, and housing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Americans want businesses to get back to focusing on their bottom line: delivering reliable, affordable, and high-quality products to customers. DEI policies are simply bad for the economy, bad for the consumer, and bad for the moral fabric of this country. Walmart is one of several major retailers that have backed off of its DEI efforts. FILE: Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio (Google Maps) Government, social groups and companies should not evangelize consumers with the left’s woke agenda – such tactics are ineffective, unprofitable and off-putting. Amid the progressive left’s cries for social justice and a corporate facade of diversity, equity and inclusion, the true purpose of business in a free society has been lost. Businesses do not provide moral or political guidance, nor should they. They exist to facilitate an exchange of goods and services and to compete with other companies for a profit by making themselves more appealing, whether through better quality or lower cost. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thankfully, American businesses are waking up to this reality, and the huge house of cards of corporate DEI may be on its way to a final, fatal fall. At the very least, we seem to be seeing an encouraging shift and a step in the right direction. Let’s hope the trend continues, and at long last, American companies can finally get back to business.

The stock market tariff tantrum of the past few weeks has seen the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 give up all their gains since the early November election victory of Donald Trump even as bitcoin (BTC) remains in positive territory. Both equity gauges are now more than 2% lower, while bitcoin is up over 20% in the same time frame. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips are in demand for uses in AI, for instance, is lower by more than 20% since Trump's triumph. On the flip side, Meta Platforms (META) is the stand out stock in the so-called magnificent seven technology companies having gained about 10%. While bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) is down over 50% from its all-time high in November, it remains up 20% since the election. Though bitcoin bulls are surely disappointed in the price performance of late — the world's largest cryptocurrency has slumped about 20% from $109,000 the day before Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 — the current price of $88,000 is still up roughly 20% from its level just prior to the November election.

March 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (‘the Company’)LEI: 213800SZZD4E2IOZ9W55 7 March 2025 A landmark year Annual results for the year ended 31 December 2024 Highlights Dean Buckley, Chair of Alliance Witan, commented: “The Company delivered strong outright gains for shareholders in 2024, although in common with most active global equity strategies, we underperformed our benchmark index, MSCI ACWI, where performance was concentrated in a handful of the largest US companies. Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure. Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested. Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return is a measure of the performance of the Company’s NAV over a specified time period. It combines any change in the NAV and dividends paid. Financial highlights as at 31 December 2024 1. Alternative Performance Measure – see page 116 of the Annual Report for further information. Notes: NAV per Share including income with debt at fair value. NAV Total Return based on NAV including income with debt at fair value and after all costs. Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT The Annual Report will be available in due course on the Company's website www.alliancewitan.com. It will also be made available to the public at the Company's registered office, River Court, 5 West Victoria Dock Road, Dundee DD1 3JT and at the offices of the Company's Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, Edinburgh House, 4 North St Andrew Street, Edinburgh EH2 1HJ after publication.

Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure. Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested. Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return is a measure of the performance of the Company’s NAV over a specified time period. It combines any change in the NAV and dividends paid.

Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT The Annual Report will be available in due course on the Company's website www.alliancewitan.com. It will also be made available to the public at the Company's registered office, River Court, 5 West Victoria Dock Road, Dundee DD1 3JT and at the offices of the Company's Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, Edinburgh House, 4 North St Andrew Street, Edinburgh EH2 1HJ after publication.

Title: Ties between The Trade Desk and key media agencies are weakening

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail The Trade Desk (TTD) and media agencies are drifting apart — a conscious uncoupling that crept in slowly but is now moving fast. Agencies say their spending isn’t climbing like it used to, while The Trade Desk is busy chasing direct deals with advertisers. It’s not a full on breakup yet, but both sides are clearly eyeing other options. One holding company media buyer, who exchanged anonymity for candor, told Digiday that rising client investment in CTV — and the many DSPs that can be used to place such spend — meant their agency was becoming less reliant on The Trade Desk over time. “We’ve had — we have — a great relationship with TTD. I just think that the dominance of the inventory that they represent is less and less important,” said the buyer. That sentiment has only grown louder over the past two years as media agencies have taken more control over programmatic ad buying. Once content to let ad tech players like The Trade Desk handle it, agencies have been pushed by advertisers to step up, building out their own tech and services to optimize ad buying. Naturally, that shift pulled them away from The Trade Desk and closer to the other power players in the auction: supply-side platforms, which hold the data and tech agencies need to secure the best ad impressions. In addition, there’s concerns among some media buyers over rising data fees and dwindling transparency around the ways its products work. “Those things add up to the point where it may be less expensive to run [a campaign] through a walled garden or another platform,” said Jonathan D’Souza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler. In turn these frustrations are starting to influence where advertisers choose to spend their dollars. Indeed, media agency execs say their dependence on it is slipping as client investments bend toward channels that The Trade Desk doesn’t dominate in, namely CTV where, despite its expertise, there’s competition. Viant, for example, saw overall revenues increased 30% in 2024. According to co-founder and COO Chris Vanderhook, that was due to a “massive tailwind” from CTV demand. It’s a thought not lost on the execs at Amazon Ads, who are using the promise of CTV advertising powered by its rich data as a hook to convince more advertisers to use its own DSP. So far, it appears to be working. The company raked in $17.3 billion in ad revenue last quarter, a 17% rise driven by its DSP’s growth. As Digiday previously reported, it’s beginning to encroach upon established ad tech players and, in time, is expected to provide serious competition for The Trade Desk. “Amazon’s DSP has come a long way, and a lot of that has to do with… their market dominance, their data, their commerce solution, their proprietary inventory,” said one anonymous buyer. “They are coming for The Trade Desk.” These tensions are mounting as The Trade Desk’s grip on ad dollars faces pressure from three sides: a fragmented CTV market, the slow death of third-party cookies that fuel its audience targeting and the looming risk that their disappearance could dent its buying efficiency in key areas. After the firm’s recent earnings brought The Trade Desk its first revenue miss in 33 straight quarters, chief exec Jeff Green told analysts that the company had overhauled its client-facing teams as part of a 15-point plan to regain momentum. That included layoffs (it’s unclear how many precisely) and a reorientation of some teams around clients and business verticals; the company’s jobs board currently includes several openings for director and manager positions focused on managing brand relationships. In addition, Green said TTD planned to pursue more joint business plans (JBPs) — direct arrangements struck with big advertisers. A Trade Desk spokesperson referred Digiday to remarks Green made during TTD’s most recent earnings call in a request for comment — during which, Green claimed that TTD’s brand direct relationships were growing 50% faster than other parts of the business. This not so subtle push to cozy up to agency clients directly might look like a threat, but it’s arguably the least important factor at play. The Trade Desk’s pursuit of more top advertiser partnerships isn’t expected to be an issue, given clients will still typically ask agencies to execute and advise on investments. “JBPs are not a threat to the way agencies work,” said one buyer, who asked to remain anonymous, citing continued existing relationships with The Trade Desk. Even recent structural shake-ups within the company’s agency team aren’t seen as something that will escalate tensions with agencies — at least no higher than they already are. In fact The Trade Desk’s day-to-day relationship with agencies appears to still be relatively healthy, especially those outside the holdco groups, according to five buyers that spoke with Digiday. For instance, at indie shop Wpromote, head of media investment Deanna Mulkeen described TTD’s DSP as “a critical part of our media mix … Nobody is perfect, but I think The Trade Desk has been really strong for us.” And for many advertisers, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. According to Ryan Eusanio, svp, video and programmatic at Omnicom Media Group, most clients will utilize multiple DSPs according to their media needs. An advertiser focusing on YouTube might adopt DV360 as a “primary” platform and use another as its “secondary”, he said. “A lot of our clients use [The Trade Desk] as a primary DSP. They’ve been an industry leader in the CTV space for a very long time, [and] we’ve built a lot of co-developed capabilities with them,” he explained. The real question, though, is how far that collaboration with agencies will go. The Trade Desk remains the preeminent gateway to the open web for many. But when growth is on the line, partnerships often take a back seat. The Trade Desk quells talk of full URL-level campaign reporting (similar to Amazon), but there are nuances. The Dentsu media agency’s three new leaders bring broader more traditional chops to widen out the agency’s ability to deliver up and down the funnel for its clients. Nothing is decided yet, but if Coca-Cola does opt for a change then Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth close to $1 billion.
