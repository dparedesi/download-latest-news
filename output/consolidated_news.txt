April 01, 2025 12:50 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, April 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: BlackRock Plans for Texas ETF Amid Its Push Into Lone Star State

BlackRock Inc. is going even bigger in Texas. The world’s biggest asset manager applied for the iShares Texas Equity exchange-traded fund, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The planned ETF would be passively managed and invest in companies that are headquartered in Texas. It’s the latest in a charm offensive of sorts in the state for the investing giant and founder Larry Fink after the firm’s embrace of environmental, social and governance investing drew the ire of Republican lawmakers. BlackRock, alongside Citadel Securities, is also an early backer of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange, which aims to begin trading in 2026. While declining to comment on the ETF beyond the filing, a BlackRock spokesperson said there’s client demand for Texas exposure. “Our clients have expressed interest in accessing the Texas economy, which has a GDP of $2.6 trillion according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and would be the eighth largest economy in the world on a standalone basis,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email. Nasdaq announced earlier this month that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas, stating that it has about 800 clients in Texas. About 200 companies listed on Nasdaq are headquartered in the Lone Star state. The New York Stock Exchange said in February that it would launch a fully electronic exchange in Dallas and reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas. Fees and a ticker for the fund were not yet listed in the filing. While many asset managers — including BlackRock — control single-country equity funds, state-specific stock funds are far less common. The Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (ticker TXS) and the Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF (TXSS), which both launched in 2023, have amassed about $28 million and $12 million, respectively. “The rationale here is that Texas is a good environment for businesses, and a lot are moving there,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “Anybody can buy this if it starts to crush it, and if it starts to crush it, then the narrative will kick in.” Topics Texas

Title: Kevin Mayer Talks Candle Media, Tightening Content Market, YouTube, TikTok and Blackstone at Paley Dialogues Event

Hollywood content 'is becoming less and less relevant' to young consumers, a trend that creates a 'substantial secular challenge,' veteran executive says By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Fiddling while Rome burns? Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer asserted that Hollywood should be much more concerned about demographic shifts and changes in consumer behavior as the math doesn’t look good for the traditional TV and film business. Mayer spoke Monday evening at the Paley Dialogue session hosted by the Paley Center for Media at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. In the session moderated by Jenelle Riley, deputy awards and features editor for Variety, Mayer said the traditional entertainment industry needs to act with more urgency to find new ways to reach consumers. Since the dawn of the millennial generation, time spent with traditional TV shows and movies is falling by double digits every couple of decades, he asserted. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Born Again’ on Disney+, ‘Daredevil’ Viewership Beats the Odds So Far Taylor Swift Breaks 100-Day Instagram Hiatus to Praise Selena Gomez's 'I Said I Love You First': 'I Love This Album So Much' “Not only is Hollywood becoming less and less relevant and less and less time spent on it, the time is spent is less profitable,” Mayer said, citing the economics of streaming content versus linear TV of old. “So there is a very substantial secular challenge that the industry is facing. There’s been some alarm, but maybe not quite enough.” Mayer, who spent more than 15 years as a senior executive at Disney and then briefly served as CEO of TikTok’s U.S. operations in 2020, cited the dramatic shifts in the content marketplace that have emerged since the end of the pandemic and the double strikes that crippled the industry in 2023. Candle Media was created in 2021 by Mayer and his former Disney colleague Tom Staggs on the theory that high-end independent production would become more valuable in a world increasingly dominated by verticially integrated studios and streamers — like the operation he helped build at Disney. Mayer acknowledged that the sharp post-strikes contraction in content commissions by global giants has created some challenges for Candle. But the other foundational idea behind the company has proven to be very prescient given all the industry gyrations and the embrace by younger consumers of social-driven video platforms. “So it’s been much harder to sell content than the streamers now than it was three years ago when we launched,” Mayer said. “So that part of our thesis was pretty incorrect. The other part of the thesis was that there would be a flywheel that would evolve. And this is something that came from my TikTok days — that if you marry social media storytelling with traditional media storytelling, film and TV, on platforms where there’s an interactivity and you can interact with your audience and gain their trust and then sell them things, then commerce would be a big thing. And that is what we call content, community and commerce. That’s a flywheel that we felt would be a really powerful one. And that is definitively true today.” Candle’s early spree of acquisitions — including Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and “Cocomelon” producer Moonbug Entertainment — were financed by coin from private equity giant Blackrock. Despite the shifting sands in the content marketplace, Mayer assured the crowd of industry insiders that Blackrock remains steadfast in its Candle investment. “We have an incredibly great private equity partner, Blackstone, which is the biggest alternative investment manager in the world by quite a big margin. They are super0supportive,” Mayer says. They’ve been with us through thick and thin. And when we find great acquisitions, they’re ready to go and support us quite well.” Mayer suggested that future acquisitions would be “on the Moonbug side,” presumably focused on digital native content with a strong social media component. Mayer and Riley spent a good deal of time talking about the importance of YouTube as a distribution platform. “YouTube has been slogging away for 20 years, and it’s the biggest out there,” Mayer said. Most important, he added, is that YouTube shells out real money to the most popular content creators. “They pay content creators now — no one else does that. You can make money on Instagram and TikTok by going directly to a marketer and cutting a deal with them for doing an influencer marketing campaign. But the player that actually directly pays in a meaningful way its creators is YouTube.” The conversational naturally wound its way around to AI and the impact of powerful new generative AI and machine learning tools on the craft and business of entertainment. Mayer said he absorbed enormous lessons after in four months at the helm of TikTok in the U.S. “TikTok really derives its value due to his AI recommendation,” he said. “It really is another form of AI which just understands your preferences and can react and get your recommendations. And that’s what Tiktok engine is. This algorithm is one big AI code that detects your most nuanced usage of the app and can tell you exactly what you love in a way that even you don’t even know.” His four-month run as CEO of TikTok USA and COO of parent company Bytedance was more turbulent than he could have imagined. It was clear after a short time that it was untenable during President Donald Trump’s first term. Four years later, however, Trump gave TikTok a stay of digital execution as he returned to the White House. He allowed the app to resume limited operations, after the Biden administration set a deadline for the app to be sold to an American-owned firm or go dark in the U.S., while stepping up efforts to find a buyer. “I was there for a short period of time because Trump was shutting us down and issued executive orders shutting down TikTok –it was very tough to be an American executive and be the head of that company. So I stepped away from that,” he said. “I don’t know for sure what’s going on there. Seems like it has a decent chance of sticking around. But the story about TikTok is almost as interesting as using TikTok itself.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Intel (INTC+0.39%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+3.25%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.88%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO+2.07%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.23%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.

(Jim West/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Fred Lucas / @FredLucasWH Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for The Daily Signal. He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. A bill in the Oklahoma Legislature to amend the state’s three-year-old anti-ESG law died last week after criticism that it would water down efforts to avoid public investments in companies boycotting oil and gas companies. ESG is an acronym for environmental, social, and governance-based investing. Oklahoma’s 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee had advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, a Republican. Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore, also a Republican, sponsored a House version. But state GOP lawmakers were divided on the matter. The bill would have removed responsibility for enforcing the law—that deals with pension investments—from the state treasurer’s office to the state attorney general’s office. “Overall, the bill would have diluted anti-ESG protections. So, I was glad to see it go,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader, the Senate sponsor, previously told The Daily Signal his bill was to “make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit.” He added that the legislation was to keep the anti-ESG law applicable, not to dilute it. Hild argued that litigation still working through the courts is not grounds to make changes. “The lawsuit was without merit,” Hild said. “The district judge overreached. It should be a basic function of government to decide who it does business with. The Legislature was overwhelmingly in support of this. Using the judiciary as an excuse not to enforce this is absurd.” Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies, including BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. The failed state Senate bill would have transferred enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. It would have also changed disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. “I was one of the many thousands of Oklahomans that called senators urging them to stop the consideration of SB 714 from forcing radical pro-ESG policies on our state,” Suzanne Ashmore, a Heritage Action for America Grassroots Sentinel from Norman, Oklahoma, told The Daily Signal. “Sentinels met with our representatives and senators in Oklahoma City to urge them to protect our oil and gas jobs and our hard earned savings from woke politics. We won’t let corporate elites crush our way of life. I’m encouraged that legislators listened.” Critics said the bill’s language would allow large asset managers to pressure companies to cut fossil fuel production through threats to vote against board members. Further, critics said that the bill would create a loophole for government agencies to ignore the statute. “ESG has become a political tool used by the Left to impose its progressive ideology on the American people. It is divisive, creates inefficiency, and has no place in Oklahoma. Heritage Action is pleased the Oklahoma Senate recognized the dangers of SB 714’s pro-ESG’s provisions and stopped it in its tracks,” Catherine Gunsalus, director of state advocacy for Heritage Action for America, told The Daily Signal. “We look forward to continuing the work alongside an army of grassroots Americans across the country to ensure ESG does not interfere with their livelihoods.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Dublin office market continues on road to recovery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/01/dublin-office-market-continues-on-road-to-recovery/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T15:25:27Z

The Dublin office leasing market continued its recovery in the first quarter of this year with take-up totalling nearly 39,500 sq m (425,025 sq ft). This is more than double the level seen in the same period in the first three months of 2024, but continues to lag behind the long-term quarterly average of nearly 60,000 sq m (425,175 sq ft). The improvement in the latest period follows a rebound in activity in the second half of last year. The full-year take-up for 2024 was up 66 per cent year on year. There is currently nearly 140,000 sq m (1.5 million sq ft) of stock reserved in the city, with nearly 30 per cent of this (44,129 sq m /475,000 sq ft) accounted for by Workday’s agreement to locate its new European headquarters offices at College Square, the major mixed-use scheme being developed by Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in Dublin city centre. Workday’s decision to locate at College Square was first reported by The Irish Times in August of last year. The largest deal of the latest quarter meanwhile was at Three Wilton Park, where big-four accounting group EY exercised their option to take an additional 5,100 sq m (54,896 sq ft) of space following their deal last year to lease 12,400 sq m (133,472 sq ft) at the neighbouring Two Wilton Park. The deal means that there is now no more available space at the Wilton Park scheme, where Stripe will occupy Number One, EY will occupy Number Two and three floors at Number Three, with LinkedIn occupying the remaining space. Other notable deals in the quarter include the signing of a long-term lease for two floors at Four Park Place, where a private-and-confidential occupier secured 3,512 sq m (36,712 sq ft). US-headquartered financial giant Blackrock secured a deal to occupy 2,000 sq m (21,527 sq ft) of space at Glencar House in Ballsbridge in Dublin 4. Just over 40 per cent of all deal activity in the quarter involved sustainable (Grade A+) buildings. Technology occupiers were the most active tenant group during the quarter, accounting for 27 per cent of take-up, while professional-services occupiers accounted for a further 24 per cent of all activity. Colin Richardson, head of research at CBRE Ireland said: “Rather than focusing solely on the volume of leasing completed in the first three-month period, we take encouragement from the outstanding requirements in the market.” “Demand is trending positively, and the level of reserved stock is a positive leading indicator. We expect take-up to continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of global macroeconomic uncertainty has yet to be felt in the Dublin market, but subject to announcements this week, will likely impact some decision-making as the year progresses.” Ronald Quinlan is Property Editor of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/01/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-renewable-energy-pragmatism-wind-solar/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T15:13:55Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, historically a supporter of green energy initiatives, acknowledged that wind and solar alone “can’t reliably keep the lights on” without “major breakthroughs in storage” and wrote that it’s necessary to be “clear-eyed about our energy mix” in his annual chairman’s letter to investors on Monday. Fink supported the transition to green energy in the past and heads BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company, which has pushed for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG). Fink said in 2023 that he would no longer use the term ESG due to its political connotation, though he’s “not ashamed” of the term and believes in “conscious capitalism.” Fink praised nuclear power and raised doubts Monday regarding the reliability of solar and wind energy alone due to storage issues in his annual chairman’s letter. “We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix,” Fink wrote in the letter. “Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can’t reliably keep the lights on.” (RELATED: ‘Gambling With The Grid’: New Data Highlights Achilles’ Heel Of One Of Biden’s Favorite Green Power Sources) Andrew Ross Sorkin speaks with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink during the New York Times DealBook Summit on November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) “In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down,” Fink said. “Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear.” In the letter, Fink points out that more nuclear power plants have been shut down than built in the U.S. over the past 55 years and lays out the benefits to nuclear energy. “Today’s nuclear isn’t the old model of massive plants with the ominous cooling towers,” he continued. “Small modular reactors (SMRs) are everything old nuclear wasn’t — cheaper to build, safer to run, and you can build them anywhere.” (RELATED: Nuclear Energy Could Be A Godsend For Biden’s Green Agenda. Here’s What’s Holding It Back) In 2020, Fink’s letter to CEOs was focused on the fight against climate change. His 2024 chairman’s letter also called for “energy pragmatism,” though it noted that countries were increasingly installing renewables “with wind and solar power,” as it was “now cheaper in many places than fossil-fuel-generated electricity.” Fink noted that pursuing these energy sources was “also a major way to address climate change.” “We follow our clients’ mandates,” Fink wrote in the 2024 letter. “BlackRock has more than $300 billion invested in traditional energy firms on behalf of our clients. Of that $300 billion, more than half – $170 billion – is in the U.S. We invest in these energy companies for one simple reason: It’s our clients’ money. If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it – the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients.” Fink’s 2025 letter did not mention climate change, though it noted that China’s push for nuclear energy demonstrates that “they see decarbonization as a way to own the future of industry.” House Republicans sent letters to BlackRock and other asset management companies in 2023 to address concerns that their ESG efforts violated federal antitrust laws. Lawmakers wrote at the time that the companies appeared to have colluded “to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management.” BlackRock exited the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative in January of this year.

Title: It's not just tariffs. 4 other issues are battering stock market sentiment.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-correction-trump-tariffs-inflation-ai-stocks-job-market-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-01T14:35:05Z
Full Content:
Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market in 2025. While anticipated tariffs have exerted the most pressure in recent weeks, the sell-off has been accelerated by a slew of data points that suggest that the economy is on shaky footing. Here are four factors that are souring the mood among investors as the second quarter kicks off. Consumers are feeling steadily worse about the state of the economy. Consumer confidence dropped for the fourth month in a row in March, hitting its lowest level since 2021, according to the latest Conference Board Survey. The Expectations Index, a broad measure of how consumers feel about the outlook for income, business activity, and the job market, dropped to 65.1 this month, its lowest level in 12 years. That's below a key level of 80, a threshold that has typically signaled a coming recession. CEOs aren't feeling very chipper, either. According to a survey conducted by Chief Executive Group, on average, chief executives rated business conditions in March around 20% lower than conditions in January. Meanwhile, the outlook among CEOs for what business conditions will look like 12 months from now dropped 28% from levels in January, the most pessimistic business leaders have been since 2012, the firm said. The downbeat mood is palpable, and Wall Street is taking notice. "In the US, there is a clear crisis of confidence," Manish Kabra, the head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Events so far this year have led us to highlight our negative views on the Nasdaq-100 and to underline that trade uncertainty is driving our trading call for the S&P 500 to fall to 5555. Most of these events are 'known knowns'. The high-flying AI stocks that have boosted the market in recent years aren't doing so well in 2025. Even before the stiffest tariff headwinds shook up the stock market, investors were questioning the longevity of the trade. In January, DeepSeek, an AI tool from China, surprised markets with a more cost-efficient model to rival US peers like ChatGPT. Since then, investors have been left wondering why the AI "hyperscalers" — companies with big AI ambitions like Meta Platforms and Amazon — have been spending so heavily on chips and other tech. More importantly, they're wondering when they might see a return on such massive capex related to AI. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which has near-equal positions in all the Magnificent Seven stocks, is down 15% year-to-date. By the end of last week, ever Magnificent Seven stock was negative for the year, with Meta the last of the cohort to give up its gains. Doubts have also been swirling for months on whether top AI firms, like Nvidia, will be able to keep up their chip sales in the coming years. "At the top of our list of concerns is the potential for excess comput as well as harsher than expected tariffs and/or export restrictions. We think the keys to the next major move in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will depend on clarity from tariffs," Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note on Monday. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, accelerating 2.8% in February, up from the prior month's 2.5% yearly increase. Hotter inflation is bad news on two fronts. For one, it could mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates this year, meaning interest-rate pressure will continue to weigh on stocks. For another, higher inflation is raising fears of stagflation, a worst-case economic scenario that describes a slowing economy with stubbornly high prices. Such a case is even harder for the Fed to deal with than a typical recession, as central bankers won't be able to cut rates to boost the economy without stoking higher prices. In a March Bank of America survey, 71% of fund managers said they saw the risk that the global economy would see stagflation within the next 12 months. The survey also found record stock selling among fund managers, with investors' allocation to the US stock market dropping to their lowest levels in about two years. "Faced with modest stagflation, we think the Fed will stay on hold," strategists said in a note. "Risks are skewed toward weaker growth and even higher inflation." Hiring isn't as strong as it's been in recent years. On top of that, DOGE-related cuts as the government pursues vast budget reduction plans is drumming up uncertainty about future jobs data. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low 4.1% in February, but continued jobless claims have climbed steadily over the past year, according to data from the US Employment and Training Administration. Layoffs also appear to be accelerating. US employers announced 172,017 job cuts in February, a 245% increase from job cuts announced the prior month, and a 103% increase from cuts announced in February of last year, according to data from Challenger, Gray, & Christmas. A weaker job market is stoking fears of a potential recession in 2025, which more forecasters on Wall Street have voiced in recent weeks. In a recent note, strategists from Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast for GDP growth while raising their forecast for unemployment and the probability of a recession this year. "We raised our 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%, reflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain," the bank wrote in a note.

Title: U.S. debt crisis could catapult Bitcoin to global dominance, BlackRock CEO warns

Fink added that tokenization would ‘democratize’ markets and would one day become familiar to investors like ETFs are today. Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, projected that Bitcoin [BTC] could dislodge the U.S. dollar from global reserve status. Fink cautioned that the U.S. dollar has enjoyed world reserve currency for decades, but that won’t last forever. Part of his annual letter to investors read, “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Source: BlackRock The U.S. currently has about $36 trillion in debt, with interest payments alone amounting to nearly $1 trillion for 2025. Fink added, “By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit.” In 2023, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz made a similar projection, as rising fiscal debt raises fears of currency devaluation and inflation. In fact, BlackRock made another recent call, stating that a recession would boost BTC’s value. In such a scenario, investors could resort to scarce alternatives, like gold and BTC, as a store of value. Besides, Fink expected real-world tokenized assets (RWA) to gain traction and called it ‘democratization.’ “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close.” Reacting to the Link’s statement, Nate Geraci of ETF Store said that top assets managers were ‘all in.’ For his part, DeFi research analyst, Ignas, termed Fink’s outlook on tokenization as ‘super bullish for crypto.’ Source: BlackRock That said, BTC was valued at $83K ahead of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs update.

Title: Govt puts Apple, Android under the scrutiny over price disparity on Uber, Ola

The government has put Ola Cabs (ANI Technologies Private Ltd) and Uber (Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd) under scrutiny after confirming in the Lok Sabha on 12 March that the cab aggregators have allegedly been charging different fares based on a phone’s operating system. The issue, flagged by members of parliament (MPs), raised concerns over algorithm-driven pricing models that may be discriminating against users depending on whether they book rides from an iPhone or an Android device. Also Read | Uber will get a robo-taxi boost. Why it’s time to buy the stock. In response to a question raised by MPs Balashowry Vallabhaneni and Ravindra Chavan, Union minister for consumer affairs Pralhad Joshi informed the Lower House that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had taken note of complaints about the alleged fare disparity and issued notices to Uber and Ola on 10 January 2025, seeking an explanation. "It has come to the notice of the Department of Consumer Affairs that ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd (Ola) and Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd (Uber) are allegedly following price disparity for cab fares displayed on Android and iOS devices for identical rides," the minister said in the Lok Sabha. Also Read | How Uber and Lyft are gearing up for the robotaxi revolution "While both companies have denied any such practice, the matter has now been referred to the Directorate General (DG) for a thorough investigation," he added. Complaints suggest that for the same ride—with identical pick-up and drop locations, estimated travel time, and conditions—users booking via iPhones are being charged more than those using Android devices. If proven true, such differential pricing could be classified as an unfair trade practice under India’s consumer protection laws, specifically the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provisions. Also Read | Inside Ola Electric’s showdown with registration agencies The government has been tightening regulations in the digital marketplace, particularly with the E-commerce Rules 2020, which bar platforms from manipulating prices or engaging in discriminatory pricing based on arbitrary factors. The case is expected to test the extent to which Indian regulators can enforce transparency in digital services, where algorithms dictate pricing models. On 23 January, Mint reported that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had issued a notice to Apple Inc. about alleged performance issues in specific iPhone models following a software update. According to the report, the CCPA, which functions under the department of consumer affairs, also sent notices to ride-hailing platforms Ola and Uber after receiving complaints about fare differences based on users' phone models. The notices to Apple, Ola, and Uber are part of the government's broader efforts to regulate digital and tech platforms in India. CCPA aims to address consumer grievances and ensure fair business practices, strengthening consumer confidence in the digital marketplace. The watchdog has also taken action against electric vehicle manufacturers, coaching institutes, travel-booking platforms, online marketplaces, consumer durables companies, influencers, and celebrities for misleading consumers or engaging in deceptive sales practices.

Title: China delays $23B sale of Panama Canal ports to US-backed consortium led by BlackRock

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/01/2025 6:09:34 AM PDT by george76 China has held up the $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide — including two key ports in the Panama Canal — to a group led by US investing giant BlackRock after President Trump expressed concern about Beijing’s sway over the strategic shipping lanes. On March 4, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. ... China President Xi Jinping is reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s plans to sell its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand ... The timing of the deal’s announcement, coming just before the start of the “two sessions,” China’s most significant annual political and economic gathering, only deepened the offense for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Panama Canal — used extensively by both the US and China — has reemerged as a flashpoint in global politics after President Trump renewed his pledge to assert American dominance over the waterway. Beijing’s move to influence the affairs of CK Hutchison reinforced concerns among global observers about China’s diminishing distinction between private and public sectors as well as its aggressive encroachment into Hong Kong’s affairs.

But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. ...

by Boris Groysberg and Eric Lin Our previous article on the persistent negative impact of resume gaps received a good deal of reader attention. It’s not surprising, given the events of 2024 in the white-collar talent market. From the very start of the year, companies like Amazon, BlackRock, and Citigroup announced white-collar job reduction efforts. In the fall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported one in four American workers who lost their jobs last year came from the business and professional services sector. In September alone, nearly half a million such jobs were eliminated, the highest number for such positions in two years. Tech, media, consulting, and finance jobs are drying up at alarming rates.

U.S. stock futures point lower as investors continue to monitor tariff announcements from the White House after President Donald Trump said that decisions on tomorrow's reciprocal tariffs have been made; OpenAI announces a $40 billion funding round led by Japan's SoftBank that values the ChatGPT maker at $300 billion; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warns firms that their CHIPS Act funding could be cut if they don't increase U.S. investments; and Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top FDA official. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower after indexes recovered from early losses Monday as investors await tariff updates. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.6% lower after the blue-chip index jumped 1% yesterday. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are pointing lower by a similar percentage. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is up about 2% to trade above $84,000. Gold futures are rising to another all-time high, and oil futures are ticking higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling. President Donald Trump said he has decided on tariffs to be announced tomorrow for what he called "Liberation Day." The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's decisions focused on enacting a 20% tariff on all U.S. imports or applying reciprocal tariffs that match those on U.S. exports. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) said it was ready to apply retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. if negotiations to avoid the increased import taxes were unsuccessful. OpenAI announced it has closed a $40 billion funding round that raises the ChatGPT parent's valuation to $300 billion. Japan's SoftBank is leading the founding round with up to $30 billion in investments, with another $10 billion coming from a syndicate. SoftBank's total investment depends on whether OpenAI transforms into a for-profit company before year's end. OpenAI said it would use the funding to "push the frontiers of AI research even further, scale our compute infrastructure, and deliver increasingly powerful tools." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly is pressing chipmakers set to receive federal funding to expand their U.S. production or face funding cuts. According to Bloomberg, Lutnick has warned firms receiving 2022 CHIPS and Science Act funding that it could be cut if they don't expand the size of their U.S. investments. Lutnick cited a recent announcement by chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities. Moderna (MRNA) shares are in focus after plummeting yesterday following the resignation of a top U.S. healthcare official over vaccine policy. Moderna stock fell almost 9% to hit a five-year low on the resignation of Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief, Peter Marks, who cited conflicts with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Moderna shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down 95% from their August 2021 peak driven by demand for their COVID-19 vaccine.

Title: Investors are stunned after the stock market closed its worst quarter in 3 year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/investors-have-pain-ahead-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-01T11:42:13Z

Good morning. Congratulations to Vice President JD Vance, who sold his home just outside Washington, DC, for $172,000 over the asking price after less than three weeks on the market. The buyer? A former Trump official. In today's big story, investors are shocked to be battling against President Donald Trump as the stock market closed its worst quarter in three years. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is setting his sights on private markets. Tech: Move over, Disney. YouTube is about to dominate media. Business: America has an affordable housing problem. Paris has the solution. But first, there may be more pain ahead for Wall Street. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Investors have come to a grim realization: Trump's not in their corner. The stock market on Monday wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022. After back-to-back years of double-digit gains, yesterday's plunge showed just how much Trump has surprised markets since returning to the White House. It seems he is no longer the market's champion. The White House has telegraphed its position stating as much, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. "Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers," the Treasury secretary said last month. Instead of equity prices, the White House is focusing on the 10-year Treasury yield to lower borrowing costs. Meanwhile, inflation and recession fears have intensified under Trump's tariff campaign. Consumer sentiment has dropped to multi-year lows and CEO confidence is spiraling as planning for the future becomes more difficult. To make matters worse, investors should prepare for another three months of pain ahead. Once-bullish investors are feeling shellshocked coming into the second quarter. "The expected fallout from Trump 2.0's Reign of Tariffs undercuts our former bullishness and dims the prospects of our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario for now," veteran analyst Ed Yardeni wrote. He lowered his S&P 500 year-end target to 6,100 from a prior forecast of 6,400. At the same time, Goldman Sachs cut its three-month target for the index to 5,300, a possible 5% drop from current levels. It's now the eve of Trump's "Liberation Day," and investors are nervously awaiting the unveiling of a range of reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. With so much uncertainty ahead, Deutsche Bank flagged three risks to watch in the coming quarter. 1. Floyd Mayweather's big commercial real estate boasts don't match reality. The retired boxing champ has bragged about a $400 million purchase of 62 Manhattan apartment buildings. But in the month since his announcement, there's been no evidence of a sale. 2. CEO Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock. After decades of dominating the liquid markets, BlackRock is betting big on private markets. Fink wrote about the transformation in his annual letter to investors, saying the firm is focused on a "$68 trillion boom" in infrastructure. 3. Newsmax might be the newest Trump trade. The conservative media company soared more than 700% in its stock market debut, valuing Newsmax at about $8 billion. That's double the valuation of Trump Media and a third of Fox Corp. 1. YouTube is about to eclipse Disney as the biggest media company in the world. The company brought in $54.2 billion in revenue in 2024, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, which is only $5.5 billion behind Disney. But people still don't seem to understand how big YouTube really is, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 2. Elon Musk is spending millions on a supercomputer, but can he run it? xAI is spending at least $400 million on building the world's largest supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to documents viewed by BI. But it's short on the power needed to operate it. 3. Tumblr is Gen Z's newest safe space. Yes, millennials, you heard that right. Gen Zers, fed up with Musk and Zuckerberg, are reviving Tumblr dot com. How long they'll stay, however, is another question. 1. Tesla told salesworkers to "stay vigilant" in a video sent before last weekend's protests. The company described a "dynamic environment" in a clip sent to sales staff. It featured smiling employees, promo footage of Optimus and Robotaxi, and a dog — but no direct mention of the recent protests. One employee called it "trivial" and "disappointing." 2. To fix America's affordable housing problem, be more French. Paris' 19th-century redesign achieved both an unrivaled urban population density and a signature look for the city. Adopting Euro-style zoning can help US cities lower housing costs and look good doing it. 3. Don't be surprised to see Gucci ads on Fox News. Conservative media outlets say they're seeing an uptick in advertising from major brands. It's a sign advertisers now see avoiding right-leaning media as a risk — and it's also a 180 from the brand boycotts of Trump's first term.

Stock edged lower on Tuesday after economic indicators showed further softening ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as of 10:10 a.m, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%. The ISM manufacturing index fell by more than expected in March to 49.0 from 50.3 in February, with the new orders reading dropping to 45.2 from 48.6. A number under 50 indicates a contraction. The JOLTS job opening tally fell by more than expected in February, to 7.57 million. On the upside, construction spending rebounded by more than projected in February as weather improved. Investors are listening for any hints about Trump’s unveiling of import taxes. The announcement will focus on “country-based” duties, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, and while the president still plans sectoral tariffs, they won’t be the focus of Wednesday’s event. Trump said Sunday that he plans to start reciprocal tariffs with “all countries,” countering speculation he might limit the initial scope of his April 2 announcement, Bloomberg reported. Be on the lookout for hoaxes — it’s April Fools Day. Here are some stocks to watch today: CoreWeave rebounded, rising 2.3% following Monday’s 7.3% decline in its second day of trading after its underwhelming IPO. The tepid market reception may be a sign that hype over AI is subsiding. Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%) fell about 0.8%. Ford’s (F+3.17%) stock fell about 1.3% after it said that its first-quarter sales fell 1.3%. Sales of electric vehicles and hybrids gained 26% to a record. PVH’s stock surged 17% after the owner of the Calvin Klein (PVH+1.47%) and Tommy Hilfiger brands projected that sales would be flat to slightly higher this fiscal year compared with last. The consensus analyst forecast had been for a decline, according to FactSet. Tesla (TSLA+3.90%) shares gained 1% after declining 1.7% on Monday. The company’s first-quarter sales, due Wednesday, will probably disappoint investors, analysts said, with some trimming their forecasts to below 400,000 units. Xiaomi’s (XIACF-4.99%) ADRs plunged 7.4% after the Chinese EV maker confirmed reports that one of its SU7 models had been involved in a crash on an expressway in China, Bloomberg reported. Local media said that three people died in the accident. XPeng’s (XPEV+1.93%) U.S.-traded shares gained 1.1% after the Chinese EV-maker said its deliveries surged 268% in March from a year earlier to 33,205 units. Quarterly sales jumped 331%.

From Aurelien by e-mail: She’s speaking at the moment but it doesn’t look good. What she did was not unprecedented in the French system (basically moving money around to meet costs elsewhere) but it was done very clumsily, and left a paper trail behind. She also denied everything from the word go, in spite of the evidence, and her defence witnesses were very unconvincing. It just goes to show that the RN is actually a pretty amateurish organisation, with a very limited capability outside Le Pen herself. I don’t think anyone else is capable of running in 2027. The political consequences are effectively impossible to predict at this stage. From Politico’s EU morning newsletter: IS LE PEN MIGHTIER THAN THE COURT? “I’m combative. I won’t let myself be eliminated,” a visibly infuriated Marine Le Pen said Monday evening. In her first interview after an embezzlement conviction that leaves her unable to run for office for five years, the far-right icon conspicuously refused to endorse her lieutenant in the National Rally, Jordan Bardella. That was the first sign of where Le Pen’s head is at as she makes an agonizing choice, as my colleagues Clea Caulcutt and Marion Solletty lay out: — Let them eat cake: After painstakingly transforming her father’s racist party into an electable force, Le Pen was a strong contender to win the French presidency in 2027. So she could boost Bardella to take the top spot on the ticket. — Après Marine, le déluge? Or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the French justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. Both options come with risks. Bardella is still seen as green (profile here). And so far, the French public seem pretty comfortable with Monday’s court ruling. An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro published Monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that France had a healthy democracy. Another 65 percent said they were “satisfied” or “indifferent” to the verdict, Victor Goury-Laffont reports. LIBERAL UNEASE: Yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. Sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law — Le Pen was convicted of misusing European Parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. But it’s not a popular rejection by the demo.

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3279745/] Lesson learned: You want an orange cat, you wear an orange shirt. Regarding cat and boy, That was beautiful! Reminds me of when my wife got me up early to drive 60 miles to a shelter to look at a bishon-poodle dog. When we were put in a room with the dog, he ran up barking and jumped on my wife and said let’s go!! He came over to me and barked a couple of time and said you’ll do. Thirteen years later, Pebbles is still my wife’s best friend and the little guy walks a mile every day and is so loyal and friendly. He made a good choice. We’re hoping he lives for many more years. > The siege of Khartoum has lifted. Left behind are scenes of unimaginable horror Wesley’s List: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran. On a side note, the phrase ‘Empire of Chaos’ dates to at least 1814. Not the first time that Khartoum has been under siege and has fallen- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6UfPtyjYQo (4:43 mins) I was lucky enough to visit Khartoum for a wedding fifteen or so years ago (an Establishment British friend married a high society British-Sudanese girl). It was quite an affair (2,000 people in a tent, every man with his stick, three days of celebrations and not a drop to drink…) and the city and country were a wonderful experience. We had to take cash and travellers’ cheques though because the country was cut off from SWIFT and only Diners card worked. As a result, the “Hilton” had long ago stopped paying licence fees to the brand owner but had kept the name. :-) We visited the pyramids at Meroe (now controlled by warlords); we spent afternoons in the fabulous National Museum (now looted); we saw the Sufi’s whirling in Omdurman (now a horror scene along with Khartoum). It was a well ordered, proud, dignified society that had made the best of a thin hand after it threw off colonial rule. The destruction of Sudan by Great Power meddling is a great crime. That sounds like an amazing experience. I knew a few cyclists who managed to cycle through the country back before it was ruined – they said that in all of Africa they had never experienced such hospitality, and they always felt safe. I was immediately struck by this headline. But the reason was that I could no longer imagine any horrors that were “unimaginable.” As I read on this was confirmed, the horrors sounded all too familiar. For example: “…They recount a siege of theft and murder, as a trigger-happy RSF militia shot those who resisted their demands. Afraid to carry their dead to graveyards, people buried those killed in shallow graves in their own streets and back yards. Elsewhere, corpses have been left to decompose where they fell. Widespread sexual violence against the civilian population has been reported from the early days of the war. It is an indication of the total siege that Khartoum was under that there isn’t yet a reliable estimate of the death toll.” For “RSF” substitute “IDF,” and for “Khartoum” substitute “Gaza.” As Clark’s list suggests, we could play this game all day. There’s no shortage of such scenes. Far from being “unimaginable,” we have to fight to keep from being numb to them. I’ve been in Khartoum a number of times for professional reasons, and whilst I can’t say it’s my favourite African country, I was always well looked after and the people are very hospitable. The Sudanese are an also a proud people and I remember being taken around the National Museum, and being told that the Sudanese had pyramids when the Egyptians were in short trousers. They were also proud of never being an Arab colony, but adopting Islam voluntarily because it had a well-developed system of commercial law. But the problem is a regime that has kept power by force (with a brutality comparable with we’ve seen in recent days) and cynically instrumentalised Islam as a way of controlling the population. It was always argued that the regime’s practice of subcontracting security to militias in distant areas of the country would backfire, and now it has. With regards to your quote on news about Marine LePen, i was wondering that OK, RN schemes were clumsily done and left a trail, but, what if in other cases there are similar trails to be followed but those aren’t followed because there is less interest in doing the same with “establishment” parties. The orders could be “focus please only on parties deemed as menaces” no matter what you find. Just as a possibility. Re: Honey bee collapse. I am a bee keeper myself and a pretty big one as hobby keepers go. It is the same story like with bird flu. You have completely unnatural conditions that result in bad immunity that result in enhanced disease. Nobody looks at the underlying conditions and “specialists” “veterinarians” a.s.o. look for some magic solution. Some basics: bees in nature stay in one place and then collect nektar, pollen a.s.o. from plants that offer the bees sustenance at various times of spring into the summer. All that in a natural order. First bloom the cherries, then the apples and at the end the chestnut trees. On top there are hundreds of different flowers, scrubs a.s.o. Each plant offers something slightly different to the bees. In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year. After the first half of the year you take away the larger part of honey and substitute it with sugar. That is how small beekeepers work all over the world. Big commercial bee keepers move from one mass flowering to the next. For instance canola to almonds. As you have mono cultures you can´t leave the bees in place. In an almond grove there would be no other food but the nektar from almonds and after the bloom bees would simply starve to death. And as the almonds groves are so massive in California you must get the bees from out of state. So commercial bee keepers need to truck their bees over hundreds and thousands of miles. From the above you can see that it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food. All that is apart from all the pesticides and fungicides that are in use in intensive agriculture. Just as you won´t get rid of bird flu in chicken concentration camps you will also never have healthy bees under such circumstances. There is no other option but to dial back the industrialisation of agriculture. Except it won´t happen unless there´s a catastrophy. Seems like we are heading that way. As with bird flu – in order not to be forced to look at the whole picture – they will try ever new band aids and find ever new “reasons” for the sudden problems. “… it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from “lesser” plants that in nature would supply part of their food.” Interestingly it’s also how we’re harming ourselves with highly processed foods. Lack of the right mix of foods to support good gut health and lack of vital micro nutrients that never make it through the processing of the food ingredients. Almonds have really been a disaster cloaked initially by being so damn profitable, which only encouraged everybody and their mother to plant ever more of the jackrabbit of food bearing trees (some varieties will get you a commercial crop after only 4 years) to the point where there are more almond trees in Cali than there are citizens in the USA, and every last one of them needs pollinators. Then the wholesale price went from $4.50 to a buck fifty a pound, and growers are going b/k all over the place, but not before playing a huge part in the destruction of our bee population in the USA. Bees there-done that “In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year.” Wasn’t there also the practice in traditional agriculture to have some late-flowering plants (e.g. ivy) around to enable bees to forage in Autumn? In the traditional agriculture in my yard, I have plants that bloom from early spring (crocus) to late fall (aster) with the intention that there will always be something around for the bees. I do plant a vegetable garden too, and I have gotten in the habit of letting at least some of my broccoli go to flower. The bees really like the yellow blossoms in the fall since they are one of the few flowers around in our area at that time. Didn’t this happen also in the early 2000s? I remember a save the bees campaign back then with predictions of a crop apocalypse. What happened, why no apocalypse that time? It was Neonicotinoids then I believe Support your local beekeepers. I have had an at least one serving per day honey habit for years. My local sources include one beekeeper who sells at the farmers market in MA and another from an activist beekeeper up north in VT. I also have a jar of Oacaxa honey (very intense) for special occasions. (A long time ago in college I worked at the usda bee culture lab in Madison. Which is where I learned to out honey in burns.) Nice to hear that you buy honey local. In fact the honey will be in sync with nature around you and with you as well. Also ask your local bee keeper to give you some propolis and some wax. Propolis helps against all kind of ailments and it is not difficult to make your own tincture and ointment once you have the above. Big pharma doesn´t like propolis ointments (acting through the FDA) but you can make your own. The farmers market here starts again in about three weeks. I will ask. Thanks. To the extent that people in cities, towns and suburbs spend some of their disposable income on “artisanal” food from relatively nearby, to just that extent will little zones of artisanal and “artisindustrial” agriculture survive right near those centers of customer spending on less-industrial food. And pay cash if you can. Many commercial beekeepers treat bees like slave labourers, starve them, destroy their social behaviours, overcrowd them and infest them with pests, and then are shocked – Shocked! – they die in droves. And expect people to pity them and compensate them for their losses. Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam! The platoon had been given the parameters to the Greenland Reorganization Economic Endeavors Diktat and we were ready to go on a moment’s notice, catching a ride on a proudly American made icebreaker to Nuuk, Nuuk, Nuuk.

Thanks for the fine mess ! The best part of waking up with a laugh is Folgers in your lap. Now THAT DEFINITELY needed a coffee warning! I’m soaking….. There is a group of lawyers in Kamloops named, “MJB Lawyers” Their slogan should be, “Good To The Last Tort” Let me get this straight. The GREED campaign will be carried out in stooges? And yes, it is entirely appropriate to name an icebreaker after someone who made a career out of bashing things, especially himself. Now, to see if the N3 can break up some ICE and escort supplies across the Artic to the gallant freedom friers of the Parti Liberacion Quebecois. ‘zackly!

Coming soon: Skipper “Body Shop” mix and match gender transactional clinic with attached Playground. The swings go both ways! That is funny! Diego Garcia is a gift to Iran. A military base used by the USA but technically controlled by the UK (we can ignore Mauritius’s claims) with essentially no civilian population who might be hit (there was an encampment of some unlucky migrants who washed up in a boat years ago but they were recently removed). It’s the perfect target for a demonstration of strength. Or do the UK and USA see this and encourage it? Has the USA moved all its B2 bombers there to tempt Iran into doing something it can use as an excuse for USA and Israeli escalation? They certainly didn’t move them there to bomb Iran. Those aren’t fighting bombers, they’re for trading etc…. Another western own-goal….in that the US is/will be using B-2s over Yemen as apparently the US Navy can’t park a carrier off the coast of Yemen (as the US did in 1967 off of Vietnam) without using all of its anti-air ammo. B-2s have a finite, expensive lifespan before needing lots of maintenance. Billions of dollars of capital, operating at millions of dollars per hour…all to “destroy” a military operated by a country that is not even recognized by 100% of the countries around the world. Team Trump is continuing Team Biden’s strategy of (a) “doing something” and kicking the can down the road is better than (b) sitting at a table and hashing out an agreement that might be incrementally negative for Israel. Someone should show Trump a map. Maybe leave it on his Oval Office desk. On this map, Yemen is labeled in big red letters “Mini Vietnam” Iran “Big Vietnam” Ukraine “Big Mama Vietnam” and China-Taiwan “Big Daddy Vietnam”. GOP = MAGA held by the puppet strings of “I stand with Zion”…. even Trump can’t grasp that Diego Garcia plays a prominent role in Twilight’s Last Gleaning, JM Greer’s all too plausible story of how the American empire finally comes crashing down Remember that part of the book well. The Chinese take Diego Garcia in a well planned raid but that was in response to the US bombing a Chinese mainland air base to teach them a lesson. Yeah, and events in the non-fiction world are proceeding unnervingly like they do in the book. Doesn’t take much imagination to see an aircraft carrier washed up on a beach somewhere. The story ends on a rather hopeful note – won’t give it away, but it’s not the worst possible outcome, not by a long shot I found that ending to be very hopeful as well. But to think that it all started because the US tried to smash & grab an African country so that they steal their newly discovered oil. Can’t imagine where Greer got that idea I just watched the movie “Twilight’s Last Gleaming,” 1977, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Perhaps there’s a different movie of the same name but the one I saw doesn’t seem to match up with comments like “American empire finally comes crashing down..” In the movie I saw Lancaster convinced the president played by Charles During to admit to the public the reason for the Viet Nam war. In the end Durning, Lancaster, and his cohorts are all shot down to prevent the public from knowing the truth. I found it heartening that in 1977 a producer had the balls to air such truth in public. Not that it did much good. The ending where the president is gunned down and the only one to run to his side was his Aide showed the disdain of all the rest of his advisors and cabinet members for his desire to speak the truth. I imagine this bears some element of truth about presidential politics even today. It also showed that even the president is expendable if he doesn’t go along with the “agenda.” Our current and future presidents may want to avoid pissing off government and non-government organizations who might wish him (or her) to retire early. Different story. Greer’s book was published in 2014. Well worth a read ‘Megatron @Megatron_ron BREAKING: 🇺🇲🇾🇪 Yemen’s Houthi have shot down an American MQ-9 ‘Reaper’ drone above the city of Marib’ By their own count, this is the sixteenth MQ-9 Reaper Drone that they have shot down. At about $30 million a pop, you are talking about nearly half a billion dollars worth of Reapers turned to ash. Start cranking all the other associated costs and now you are talking well north of half a billion bucks. If they can do this, then it is only a matter of time until they get a luck hit on a Navy ship in the Red Sea. So what will Trump do then? Rage that he will unleash hell or some such? Offer to make a deal? If he can’t break tiny Yemen, than what makes him think that he can do so to Iran? Stephanie Kelton to debate Steve Moore April 16th, she gonna eat his lunch and snacks! Colorado River Water disappearing. Here I thought it was over-appropriation and use by humans. It’s the damned headwaters biomes! Blame the ecosystem, NOT the humans! I saw that too. All that freeloading, parasitic vegetation sucking up all that water which could used for almonds farms or whatever. I got an idea. They should spray Agent Orange all over that region and kill off all that lazy, unproductive vegetation so that all that water will have the freedom to flow unhindered to the Colorado river. Problem solved! An idea that Trump himself could be proud of. They’ve tried that already, the Mekong River. So, the Colorado “deforestation” campaign will be the Beta test? (Do they have Marmot Cong in Colorado?) Water is for lying over/Whiskey is for lying under: dept. The difference from Cali water and Colorado River water, is the latter allows for so much potential pilfering compared to the relatively short delivery span of aqua here-less chances of chicanery. Trump should impose tariffs on those free loading plants. Because it will make him feel better without actually doing harm to anyone or thing. It’s almost all orchards here in the southern San Joaquin Valley, and farmers & local officials of the far right persuasion refer to the pines that get first dibs on water in the higher climes as: ‘Straws’ I can just imagine those orchard owners looking up to all those pines while fingering a cigarette lighter in their pocket. There are an estimated 129 million dead trees in CA that are no longer water straws. But they are ready to burn. I remember reading that there is great concern that CA will have the most massive wildfire, ever, in the Sierra Nevada. Methinks the number is closer to 200 million newlydeads in the Sierra Nevada, and the 129 million number is from the 2012-16 drought. In the earlier epoch rarely did a pine above 7,500 feet succumb to the bark beetles, now its closer to a 9,000 foot ceiling for the die-off. It’s my contention that Bill Gates stays awake at night fretting about all those birds sleeping for free in his trees. The man really hates Nature. Maybe this would help him: “Mother Earth.” You laugh… The Tamarisk Hunters Canadians were clubbing the baby seals because seals ate their fish… Stabroek Block Oil reserves estimate of 11 Billion barrels… Hess believes more. US uses 20 Million bbl/per/day m/l; 11,000,000,000 / 20,000,000 = 550 days of US demand. Heck with the rest of the world demand, it’s all about US. Note, there is an absence of we in US these days.

It’s reminiscent of religious relics, imagine what a piece of the cloak that Jesus wore on the cross would be worth if included in a limited edition card? And the cup? Half full? Half empty? When you are an engineer, air is just another fluid. The Cup is never half-empty. Lots of listings for “true cross” reliquaries on auction sites. Legal update: CFPB spared, for now: https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5220651-federal-judge-trump-cfpb/ A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from effectively dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an early target of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson barred the administration from stopping work and firing employees at the CFPB and ordered the reinstatement of previously terminated workers. She also blocked the destruction of any CFPB records and ordered the recission (sic) of any “wholesale” contract cancellations issued on or after Feb. 11. However, USAID has met its fate. An Appeals court lifted a lower court’s TRO restraining and held that the Trump admin and Elon may proceed feeding it headfirst into the wood-chipper. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that social-media posts like Musk’s declaration that he “fed USAID into the wood chipper” didn’t legally prove he was making the orders. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/appeals-court-clears-way-for-doge-to-keep-operating-at-usaid/ar-AA1BRPGO Musk is feeding more than the agency into the wood chipper: The axing of some 10,000 programs has consigned untold numbers of children and refugees to death, officials say. https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-usaid-rubio-marocco-canceled-programs-gaza-syria-congo-hiv-ebola Are we 100% sure that all those programs are what they seem? USAID is a front for the CIA after all. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna While I’m not a fan of the chainsaw budget cutting, he might inadvertently be doing a lot of people a favor. Of course we can’t possibly be 100% sure. Is it 100% certain that the Guardian article is true? It’s clear, though, that the humanitarian programs exist and are crucial to the health and survival of many people around the world in poor countries, even if the CIA is involved in some cases. This is according to media reports, the UN, multiple private aid agencies, government officials, etc. Pretty sure these are actual programs that help people: S. Africa: USAID cuts could prompt over 500,000 HIV deaths https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420 and https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-trump-funding-pause-500-million-food-spoilage-risk/ “USAID plays a major role in coordinating earthquake assistance.” https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-notified-congress-intent-reorganize-usaid-rubio-says-2025-03-28/ There are many more examples. I doubt the CIA is involved in all of them. Why couldn’t the aid have been continued de-coupled from any spook activities? Axing all of them at once is unconscionable. But, Musk obviously doesn’t care about that and scored political points by doing so. It was probably the humanitarian programs in particular which upset Musk. A short critical German comment on USAID by Austrian Hannes Hofbauer (whose restrictive views on migration I e.g. do not share.) machine-translation from German NACHDENKSEITEN On the end of USAID: self-empowerment instead of external control https://archive.is/frJFL “(…) Development of underdevelopment Malaria: widespread. HIV: Africa’s hostage. Hunger: not eradicated. Since the term “development aid” was popularized in the 1960s, hopes have rested on it – in vain, as history shows. According to a UNICEF report, 733 million people worldwide were affected by hunger in 2023, 152 million more than four years previously. Africa leads the field, with a 20 percent increase in the number of hungry people. Since 2010, the number of undernourished people has also been rising sharply again – in sub-Saharan Africa from 18 percent to 23 percent.[ The entire paradigm of development aid – rich north helping poor south – has failed across the board. Honest aid workers can hardly admit this, and those who abuse it as an instrument to build political influence and economic outflow cling to it anyway, out of self-interest. (…) Through so-called partnership agreements, the EU has also opened markets to EU-European goods with over 30 African and Caribbean countries, driving local businesses, farmers, and fishermen to ruin. Their sons, deprived of their livelihoods, are drawn north, across the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to Europe. (…)” Of course within a huge structure through e.g. inertia some positive outcomes of any such opertion are not impossible. Just look at British or French colonial history. In fact to offer genuine aid bolsters any form of serious control. But the strategic relentless prerogative shouldn´t be denied. USAID reminds me a bit of philanthropy: People turn into billionaires by destroying the lives of millions ripping off entire countries. While at home using that profit they pay for cultural or social services to the benefit of a few hundred or thousand – admired by media. Like shooting off someone´s leg in order to steal his home but then getting him a wheel-chair for free under the eyes of the press. p.s. To clearify: An Elon Musk doesn´t care for the Global South any more than any EU-Commission member or Boeing. So the positive effects of USAID dismantled again are certainly not intended. I must admit to quite a bit of schadenfreude watching Musk whine about vandalism on his lots on Fox’s “The Five” this afternoon. Poor baby after taking a chainsaw to the lives of thousands. Otherwise, things are getting biblical. The SSA change that ends using phones for making changes to one’s SS account quickly became, in some news circles, a decree that all SS recipients come into the offices that are still open to prove their identity. Made it seem all Christmassy to me: “And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world…” Then to satisfy my curiosity about the UK’s breakdown, I watched this fellow get interviewed by the same hard right British “channel” as interviewed the frightening young fellow I linked several days ago. This guy, who was a Tory and UKIP member of Parliament for more than a decade, says that “being born in a stable doesn’t make you a horse.” He proposes that Britain should “remigrate” up to the second generation of descendants of immigrants back to the countries where their ancestors came from. In other words, if your grandpa came from Jamaica, even if legally, back you go. But this Mr. Carswell offers his advice not from a post in not-so-merry old England but from the American state of Mississippi where he is the CEO of some non-profit funded by somebody who shouldn’t be allowed to have money. So when I heard Carswell advocate for returning the first and second generation of British descendants of immigrants, legal or illegal, this sprung to mind: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me Crazy times. “Trump to Unveil Country-Based Tariffs April 2 in Rose Garden” Of course the whole thing is a shakedown. He is putting a tariff on every country that there is but I think that the real reason is so that he can extract economic concessions from them. I think that there are two or three demands that the Trump regime is making of Oz. One is to get rid of our PBS subsidized drugs so that Big Pharma can make big profits here like in the US but that is absolutely the third rail in Oz politics. Another is stranger. There is an attack on our Goods & Services tax here in Oz. In short, you buy something or pay for a service here, you have to pay a tax on it. The US is crying that it is an unfair tax but many States in the US do exactly that- https://theconversation.com/is-australias-gst-a-tax-or-a-tariff-and-why-has-it-become-a-target-in-the-trade-wars-250041 I think that the problem is that the US buys more from Oz than Oz buys from the US and Trump is upset by that. But there is a solution. The biggest export to the US by a country mile is gold which is why the imbalance. So I propose that we stop selling gold to the US. Immediately the deficit will run the other way, Trump is happy and I am pretty sure that Oz can find another country to sell our gold to. Anybody know the telephone area code for Beijing? AI is “running out of juice” (The Register) https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/14/ai_running_out_of_juice/ If you look closely at what Microsoft has been doing with AI, you’ll see that it’s pulling back in places some of us wouldn’t think to look. Microsoft has canceled more than a gigawatt of datacenter operations in addition to numerous 100-plus MW agreements. I’m old enough to remember when the “Juice” ran for 2003 yards, breaking Jim Brown’s NFL rushing record in the old Shea Stadium. Maybe AI must bring back “the Juice” for the man in the street? Regarding the ruckus about the USA moving airforce assets to Diego Garcia: “The media and some readers argued that Iran might not be able to reach Diego Garcia. Iran is signaling otherwise.” There is another hypothesis: those B2 & co bombers are not there to attack Iran, but to subdue Yemen. I agree with that hypothesis. I already commented here that I believe the USA first has to crush Yemen if a joint Israel-USA attack against Iran is really to take place: having Ansarallah capable of wreaking havoc in the rear is something that must be excluded for such an offensive to have any chance of success (and even then). The massive bombardments that are now taking place against Yemen (several dozens of attacks daily) show that the focus is on eliminating Ansarallah as a player able to lob missiles and drones at Israeli and American ships and bases in the region. If and when this is achieved, then the USA will be able to proceed with Iran. I see Iran has three Kilo-class submarine. Can you imagine what would happen if after the US launched an attack against Iran, that one of them surfaced near Diego Garcia and lobbed a few missiles into the airbase just as those planes were getting ready to land again? Just sink (or debilitate) US Navy oilers in random corners of the world. The US only has so many. even losing one makes things more complicated The US military has a logistical chain built on playdoh Not sure the Iranian Kilo boats have missile capability? RE: The Code That Controls Your Money I notice that it is written by someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC (paraphrasing): I can no longer see any way for a human to progress without harming another Which resonated then, and booms emptily more these days. a natural consequence of having 8+ billion people on the planet, and the politically incorrect observation that certain jurisdictions have 0, or negative, non-migration population growth while others don’t. PS, I hate the Club of Rome and their intellectual heirs I think that is a bit of a stretch, we (as a species) are bearing the consequences of earlier globalisations, destabilising previously stable populations. Do you enjoy being historically incorrect as much as politically? “someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC” I doubt it. The article states that Clive Thompson is a journalist who writes about science and technology and as far as I can remember, NakedCapitalism commentator Clive was a software engineer, not a journalist. Since the article talks about COBOL, let me add a few points. 1) Learning COBOL — or most other programming languages — is not that difficult. While this is the first obstacle to having programmers able to deal with those legacy systems, the other software components and libraries that those COBOL programs rely upon constitute a really big hurdle. I bet that many of those banking/financial/insurance COBOL programs make use of the services of such software systems as CICS and IMS — IBM technology from the 1960s to deal with transactions and databases. Yes, IBM is still maintaining all of it. This is something that is often forgotten: learning a programming language is not enough; one must be knowledgeable with a large set of external libraries, additional software components, and ancillary services to develop or maintain anything of value. This does not just affect COBOL; the situation is the same with modern programming languages (for instance, since they are mentioned in the article, Java, Python, JavaScript). 2) By the mid-1980s, development had moved from programming individual COBOL statements that invoke those auxiliary libraries and modules explicitly, to embedding some higher-level descriptions or instructions in the COBOL program that would then be processed and automatically transformed into the necessary COBOL code. For instance, one would insert a (properly tagged) SQL statement that would then be replaced by the necessary COBOL calls to the database management system. This was possible not just for database functions, but also for user interfaces, report writers, communications, etc. So when reading about the sheer amount of existing COBOL code, remember that a large fraction of it is not hand-coded, but automatically generated from other formalisms (at least from the late 1980s onwards). 3) Ah, the infamous “GOTO”! Two things: first, it is “GO TO” in COBOL, not “GOTO”. Second, the real killer in COBOL is the “ALTER” statement. I will not explain it, but suffices to say that our teacher of COBOL refused to explain its semantics, telling us to never use it, and that one of my colleagues once joked about making use of one such statement to make life “interesting” for future maintainers of the application he was developing. Disclaimer: I learned COBOL at the University, and developed in COBOL in the mid-1980s. What I remember is the hierarchy between application programmers and systems programmers. The systems guys were the high priests needed to make things work — they knew the inner workings of the OS. In my DoD days we had Ada as the language that would incorporate all the best software engineering ideas. Problem was it was competing with the private sector C and then C++/C# with OOA/OOP concepts and while DoD was important, thanks to the mini/micro revolution it wasn’t big enough to command things. Agree that much of the problem is a system engineering one. Interfacing systems, understanding and implementing APIs, testing interoperability. I guess Rust is coming on as the language de jour, with JSON and REST getting a lot of the web interfacing chores. Much respect, thanks for this comment. I was employed for about 5 years writing Javascript in my mid-30s back when the WWW was fairly new, after failing Comp Sci 101 in the 80s with punchcards. But I’ve always been fascinated by the history of computing. “Germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war” This could get interesting. I can just see the next general NATO meeting now and where the German representative stands up and says- ‘OK now. Just for the official record. So you want Germany to build up our military into a powerful force once more.’ Lots of nods. ‘Then you want German tank armies to go charging across the plains of Poland.’ More nods from the other NATO members. ‘Then you want the German army fighting the Russians in front of the gates of Moscow.’ Yet more nods. ‘And nobody sees a problem with any of this.’ The other NATO members then shake their heads. Lighten up,Kev. This is very much the age of looking forward,not back. Are you going to hold Baerbock and Baroness VDL to account for their descendants’ honourable sins forever? Then Mark Rutte says “I assume I’ll be getting a raise?” to many nods and whispers Wait,…did I just hear a champagne cork…? Annalena Baerbock (AB): Radek, why our all those new tanks you bought recently parked at our border? Radek Sikorski (RS): We wanted to protect them from the Russians. Hold them in reserve. AB: Ok, that makes sense but why are they all still pointing towards Germany? RS: It costs lots of fuel to even turn those big boys around so we just left them like that for now. But don’t worry, we can have them do a full 360 in a flash. AB: Thanks for the reassurance. Do you think you could lend us a few attack helicopters. I read you bought a bunch of those recently too. RS: Sorry, no. AB: Are you still planning to do a joint build with South Korea of fighter jets in Poland? RS: Sorry, can’t discuss that. Do you need some old MIG’s? AB: No, I hate anything Russian. RS: Well, at least we have that in common. Good luck. But isn’t there also a history of Germany forcing overthrow of the Russian government followed by civil war? Only when the Romanovs were still in charge, right? Never even close since then. Rev Kev that is pure comedy! RE:The Senescence Loop What do you expect from a lamarckian process? Soft inheritance via personal computer/oracle will not reproduce, but merely,and increasingly meagerly produce. “Men are increasingly automatons, who make machines which act like men and produce men who act like machines; their reason deteriorates while their intelligence rises, thus creating the dangerous situation of equipping man with the greatest material power without the wisdom to use it.” – Erich Fromm, The Sane Society (1955) I’ll buy that for a dollar!

Heaven knows my predictive powers are at best crummy; I have predicted 10 out of the last 2 bear markets. This is the point in time where, in the past, Ben Bernanke or Greenspan would have dropped a surprise 50bps rate drop on the market, effectively nuking “Da Bears” from low Earth orbit. But this ain’t 2007 or 1998, so perhaps we are going to see this stinking market crater into oblivion. When CNBC puts up the “Markets in Crisis” banner that’s time to buy. In the hundred daze campaign by our Tettotalitarian Leader, he’s done everything to alienate anybody left that still has a scintilla of sense, and they’re all tied to us via the almighty buck, yuck.

Adios hegemony~ Don’t even want to bring up Hiroshima & Nagasaki, but we’re zeroing in on the fourth turning there, too. I have a bad feeling about this, to quote Indiana Jones. There will be some rip-your-face-off countertrend rallies in the coming bear market, to be sure. But it’s clear to me that AI has come a cropper, and deglobalization won’t come easily. Predatory late-stage capitalism doesn’t have a reverse gear … that means driving us all off a cliff is the endgame. Can you imagine various European nations recommending their citizenry to have 72 hours worth of rations on hand, in late August of 1939? That’s the feel of goings on, prepping for 3 days-not 2,200 days. I just assumed that was a form of narrative building, i.e. “evil Russkies, mama!” meant to scare the locals into a docile and subservient position. My operating assumption is that WWIII has already begun. But to your point, the notion that it will all be over in 72 hours, and then we can to back to our regularly scheduled episodes of “Real Housewives of the ATL” is rather comical. More likely, it will play out like “The Walking Dead.” BTW, error noted – Han Solo said “I have a bad feeling about this” not Indiana Jones. Quite true that- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ogIuFclGE8 (1:52 mins) Yes. “It’s a trap!” The German title for Don Siegel´s “Madigan” was – “Nur noch 72 Stunden” / “72 hours left” The German title for Paul Haggis´s remake “The Next Three Days” was – “72 Stunden – The next three days” The German title for Javier Gutiérrez´s “Tres Dias” was – “72 Stunden – nur noch 3 Tage” Germans seem to have a math problem. So if you bring in 2,200 days that´s not gonna end well. Total confusion. By total I mean – a “One thousand” – kind of confusion. (“360-degrees-syndrom” also made in Germany) p.s. as Ian Proud is concerned – that was an April 1st prank by him on us In the UK, many families don’t have the next meal on hand and our government just doesn’t care. Now that more working class and middle class families find their earners trapped in the gig economy, they are beginning to rely on food banks rather than making donations to them. And when the middle class feel the bite of hunger and the threat of permanent impoverishment for their offspring, that’s when the need for real political reform takes shape in their minds and they take the first faltering steps towards reality. I think we are reaching the position where Farage will make a real breakthrough and Reform becomes a broad enough church to win the next election. It might be a good idea to have a government relying on a parliamentary majority consisting of people with little or no political experience who have become politicians out of necessity because they’ve given up hope in the existing order and not because it is a good career choice for someone on the make. But as with other countries in Europe, will the British establishment allow new politicians into power or find creative ways to block them? “Taiwan accuses Chinese chipmakers of illegally poaching engineers” Maybe that story is not so simple. Maybe those Taiwanese bosses told some of their engineers that they have a new assignment for them. That they will be sent to the US to go work in setting up a new chipmaking foundry there. And those engineers sat down after work in a bar sharing their thoughts. Working and living in America would be a great experience. Doing the same in Trump America may be not so much. Even Canadians are avoiding traveling there and the number of ways that you can fall afoul of law enforcement/ICE/FBI, etc. is legion. On the other hand they can actually see China from their office windows. You could work there and see family every weekend. They talk the same language and have the same customs. For any Taiwanese engineer that would be a great temptation and it is not like Taiwan values its workers that much. The headline just seems to conjure images of Chinese poachers, dressed in Ghillie suits, stalking the streets of Taipei and darting unsuspecting engineers with trank guns, then dragging their unconscious forms off to Shanghai. I suppose that even works as a resurrection of the old verb “shanghai,” right?

Someone wake me up after this nightmare is over. Odds are more likely we too will wake up in an El Salvadorian prison than in our own beds before the nightmare is over. I’ve no idea what a useful path forward may be but does not seem like an ideal time to go to sleep. Crazy that we’re losing a debate on the merits of the Magna Carta in 2025. Seems like only yesterday this anti-Due Process crowd was livid over cancel culture. “Trump Administration Targets Harvard With Review of $9 Billion in Federal Funding ” My take is that Big Ed, much like DEI-wokeworld made a lot of enemies and alienated almost all potential allies. Now the Republicans in power are going to smack them around a bit. It’s a cheap giveaway to some of their allies with the bonus of dinging what has become a power base for the Democrats. Perhaps they can keep Harvard going with plasma donations in the i.v. league, er mobile blood donation vans? Unfortunately, I think this is a significant factor. And it’s nothing new. George Wallace used to slap “pointy-headed liberals” around a lot with much success, and conservatives have been making fun of obscure research projects by academics forever. And liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped. Many people who do not live their lives in academic bubbles or education-adjacent PMC enclaves do not see the world the same way and will not connect the necessary dots. I was very sympathetic toward that Rutgers Resolution for the Big Ten schools, but I doubt if that would be the case for the broader public. Now if Trump were to slap a 25 percent tariff on football tickets or alumni donations to athletic programs, well that would be a whole new ball game – so to speak. (See, I can’t even keep myself from being condescending!) Not a fan of “liberal condescension toward the deplorables” but having been born in the Heartland and moved to the coastal cities as an adult I find the crying about condescension to be hypocritical at best. Mostly it seems like projection. Much like the GOP cries of “groomers” when every week another is busted for worse. Anecdotal but the only times I’ve ever had a gun pointed at me were by the NYPD (lived in a latino neighborhood and police raids were common) and in the heartland by a guy who didn’t like my “fruity” look. Also while in Texas on a film production had a local in a cowboy hat and AR-15 graphic t-shirt threaten to “kick my Hollywood p-ssy -ss” for enforcing on-set mask mandates back in 2020. I could list numerous other examples of Heartland values I’ve experienced that 25+ years of NYC/LA living have avoided but won’t for brevity. I’ll just say that I’ve lived in city neighborhoods often deemed dangerous yet have never had threats or issues in these places like I have experienced in small town America. So, for some of us, not seeing “the world the same way” is why we prefer the very flawed world view of coastal elites. Yeah, I got turned down for a job because they didn’t want to hire a cis white guy (was surprised they actually said that!) but they’ve never pulled a gun or threatened to beat me. Every so often I scroll through the threads on Truth Social, Rumble, and Gettr to get a glimpse of the conservative cultural landscape. Similarly will browse Bluesky and Mastadon for liberal ones. The liberal platforms are very PMC Russia-gate delusions of being one lawsuit and Sorkin speech away from mimosa brunch utopia. The conservative ones are a descent into violent civil war fantasies, gun fetishists, replacement theory rantings, and dreams of putting women back in their place. Both are crazy but only one is wishing for a new Crusades. Personally, as a person and an artist, I try to find ways to bridge divides and wish that was a more common approach. So, yeah, maybe “liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped” and maybe wokeness was annoying but back in 1946 Superman was shown punching Klansmen (the original idPol activists) and that was considered a good thing. Now are we supposed to just accept there are “good people on both sides” because the Heartland might get offended if we say such things are bad? What (if any) critique of so-called small town values is acceptable? Or is “this” only an acceptable mantra for one side? I have dual citizenship: rural Illinois and west coast port city. In my boonies the condescension is noticed and leaves a mark. President Garber’s official letter to the Harvard Community.

Dear Members of the Harvard Community, Earlier today, the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism issued a letter putting at risk almost $9 billion in support of research at Harvard and other institutions, including hospitals in our community. If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation. The government has informed us that they are considering this action because they are concerned that the University has not fulfilled its obligations to curb and combat antisemitic harassment. We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry. Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus. I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university. For the past fifteen months, we have devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism. We have strengthened our rules and our approach to disciplining those who violate them. We have enhanced training and education on antisemitism across our campus and introduced measures to support our Jewish community and ensure student safety and security. We have launched programs to promote civil dialogue and respectful disagreement inside and outside the classroom. We have adopted many other reforms, and we will continue to combat antisemitism and to foster a campus culture that includes and supports every member of our community. We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government’s task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission. Much is at stake here. In longstanding partnership with the federal government, we have launched and nurtured pathbreaking research that has made countless people healthier and safer, more curious and more knowledgeable, improving their lives, their communities, and our world. But we are not perfect. Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends—and to the teaching and research at the heart of our University—will not waver. Sincerely, Alan M. Garber Cowards indeed. They should have stood up on the hind legs when the slavering Elise Stefanik went after the college presidents. And that was when Biden was president, and I don’t remember that he objected to it at all. And not many other Democrats either. And from the letter, you can see that these universities have bought in 100% to the new definition of “antisemitism”. Really tired of all the liberal mewling about everything that’s going down right now, and then watching them do nothing at best, or help Trump along at worst (Thanks Chuckie!) A pox on all their houses. Which given current national health policy, is actually very likely! via Adam Tooze on Columbia by David Pozen of the Columbia Law School The Tenth Demand? David Pozen The latest drama at Columbia—involving interim President Katrina Armstrong’s “resignation”—has broad implications for the academy and American democracy. Once unpacked, this episode throws into sharp relief the issue of whether universities now operate at the pleasure of the White House. https://substack.com/@adamtooze/p-160353375 re: Doctorow Trump’s attack on elite American universities: just punishment but for wrongly identified offenses https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/04/01/trumps-attack-on-elite-american-universities-just-punishment-but-for-wrongly-identified-offenses/ It seems rather quaint now, but I can dimly remember a time when antisemitism didn’t mean pro-genocide. IMO you win the internet for the day. There must surely be groups collecting and breaking down which institutes across the country get cut down. And which do not. Just like nobody touching DoD. So I am waiting for Taibbi/Kirn to address that eventually… If protest won´t be supported at some point by institutions, i.e. party structures, unions, academia, churches the current movement won´t have any effect. Which I assume will be the case. Our Western societies have become so affluent that any serious urge to change has disappeared under the too many layers of wealth still entitled to by too many. If I am reading the news correctly, Trump intends to bomb Iran, seize Greenland, fight Venezuela, repel a Chinese takeover of Taiwan, continue the fight in Ukraine, and back Israeli genocide in gaza while bombing Somalia. Has he decided to go to war with everyone and see how it shakes out? Dude you missed Canada! Now our feelings are hurt, eh? And win the Nobel Peace Prize! On his own nomination! And tariff everyone on top of that. ‘vitrupo @vitrupo Instead of learning how to code, Replit CEO Amjad Masad says “learn how to think, learn how to break down problems, learn how to communicate clearly.” Is there an accreditation for this? Asking for a PMC friend. And this guy is actually going to put his trust in AI generated code? OK then. What could possibly go wrong? I guess that makes sense; Replit is all about live coding environments; LLMs doing the coding for you means more customers for him and his service. Thailand Says Collapsed Bangkok Tower Used Substandard Steel Bloomberg. The latest news I’ve seen is that four senior staff of the Chinese company that was the main construction partner have been arrested for (allegedly) trying to remove records from the site. I doubt if this could have been caused by substandard steel, even if it was used. A quick google indicates that the construction of the tower has been very troubled, with lots of delays. This can be highly problematic in building construction as there can be break in the ‘knowledge’ trail due to changes in staff/contractors after an unplanned pause, and if a building is left exposed you can have unexpected deterioration in structural fittings that were never intended to be exposed to the elements. For example, concrete has been laid, its very difficult to test if it was done correctly in the first place, and a pressurised sub-contractor may just assume that it had been done to legal standards by the previous contractor. As one engineer who had a business fixing concrete rot once said to me – ‘a good paper trail is not a guarantee of good concrete’. But it could have been just bad luck with timing, depending on the construction design. The basic frame may have been in place before stressing cross-braces were put in place, or the foundation may still have been open to allow ground works, before everything was concreted over. For the most part, most building codes apply to the finished building, not an interim structure (I confess to knowing zero about Thai construction codes, except that they are much weaker than most western countries, but substantially better than most poorer Asian countries). Construction here is not very good. Air conditioners do not have filters. Toilets do not have traps. Many tall-ish buildings do not have steel frames (there is a term of art, which I forget, but one floor is built on pillars, and then the next floor is built on top of that). And that’s before getting to the ability to make payments to smooth bureaucratic obstacles. Reinforced concrete framing, otherwise known as “Pancake Stacks.” We have a lot of reinforced concrete framing here in Uruguay, but we don’t have earthquakes. I really don’t think that the structures themselves are deficient, but that they tend to pancake during earthquakes. I remember the freeway that pancaked in San Francisco in the World series earthquake of 1989, Loma Prieta lazy load-bearing walls and earthquakes don’t mix….and it’s unfortunate that, like many parts of Asia and other parts of the world, the local authorities can’t codify safe practices which literally arose from the body count of early-industrial age (see Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire) Article mentions “steel bars” suggesting rebar, but maybe this is a translation thing and it’s structural steel forms. Reminds me of the 1031 Canal (Hard Rock Hotel) collapse in New Orleans in 2019 (I was there at the time). Seems like the design was fingered as the culprit. Or the FIU bridge collapse where the construction team changed the design without going back to the designers. I’ve been wading through Marc Andreesen’s “Techno optimists Manifesto”, Nick Land’s “Dark Enlightenment” and some of “Mencius Moldbug’s” writings. Their plan seems to have three parts. !) Destroy American Civil Society. 2) After a period of Civil unrest and Martial law which will “Right Size” the population, impose the Technate. 3) Paradise! I have few doubts that the first part will succeed, it is well underway and I see little opposition to date. The assumption that Civil unrest and “Right sizing” the population is going to be controllable seems unrealistic. And the assumption that our Techlords will be the only ones attempting to fill that political vacuum seems to ignore groups such as the Mormon Church, which is a State within the State. There are others… “If everything goes as planned” ignores the fact that Murphy always shows up at the party, invited or not. It won’t be boring. No kidding. These geniuses (genii?) possessing neither a drop of empathy nor any understanding of how humans work really think they can make this happen. Sure, they’ll just impose themselves on the populace whether the rabble likes it or not. They seriously can’t conceive of anyone opposing the gift of enlightenment they would bring. Certainly not any churches, organized crime groups, unions, militias (right, left and non-partisan), ethnic communities, rural communities, National Guard units who remained loyal to their states, etc. As someone said the other day, I’ve never seen a successful oligarchy with this many unemployed snipers around. They’ll learn too late why we went to the trouble to build civil society in the first place. It’s like ol’ Mencius was too busy trying on leather jackets for his photo ops to pick up a book on the Thirty Years War (which loomed large in the minds of the founders, I can assure everyone). Oh well, like you say – interesting times ahead. (Thanks for letting me vent!) US Military returning home might have a different take on things, despite its very corrupted higher eschelons… Dang, I don’t see many April fools jokes, unless I’m fooled. Fool me, let’s go. at least I found one, Ian Proud link above Here you go. Enjoy. https://www.idcommunism.com/2025/04/russia-after-95-years-on-public-display-lenins-body-will-be-laid-to-rest-in-ulyanovsk.html Here is probably the best one I have run across today. If you look at the title of the very first podcast in the list. The eyebrow-raiser – Dr. Ehrman actually was very much involved in the presentation of The Gospel of Judas to the public twenty or so years ago, and that was anything but a hoax. So, there is some ring of credibility there which made the joke all the more gripping. If you are interested, the entire podcast from today’s April Fool’s festivities was all about the most important hoaxes and forgeries of gospels and other Christian documents. It was actually quite enlightening. Just FYI, I have been reading and studying the Ancient Greek and Latin for decades. All of the ancient classical library of Greece and Rome and all of the Christian documents. Dr. Ehrman, of Duke University, an avowed atheist, is by far and away the best teacher and study guide for those interested in the koine Greek Christian canon. I always leave his lectures with more questions than answers. https://www.bartehrman.com/podcast/ An oldie but a goodie. A lot of people believed this was a true story at the time, including other news outlets not noticing it was in the April 1st edition of Sports Illustrated. / ;) https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/10/15/curious-case-sidd-finch via RACKET Another good doc-video on protest, by Ford Fischer / News2Share Protesters face off outside Tesla dealerships nationwide over Elon Musk’s “DOGE” 15 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkWwS4OE-0 The problem: If this is First Amendment the First Amendment is a joke. It´s a worthless token offered to the protest rabble to give them the feeling that they actually can do something. Which they can´t. In fact it´s an expression as it is a cover for and of total and utter powerlessness. Everyone doing some idiotic thing in public apparently invokes the First. The First provides the right to be a moron. Wow. Very helpful. That´s almost like protest against “the right” in Germany. Completely worthless. I doubt these people would be protesting in front of BMW or GM. Though those companies do not cause less destruction on the planet. Or of course take any multi. They say Musk. But they ought to say capitalism. But capitalism has again become the sacred cow of Jane and John Doe. Long live the First International. Oh? Is that why govt worked/works so hard to silence certain voices and threads via NGO cutout organizations? Because the 1st is a joke? Riiight…. I am all in for the First. And I am abhorred over what is going on in Germany (the only case I can judge). And I will always defend it. BUT: The fact that there is free speech – whatever its limits in Europe e.g. – what´s it worth? Did it stop us from inching towards WWIII? Does it stop a genocide committed as openly as ever? Does free speech stop the destruction of free speech on campuses in the US? Will it stop the destruction of labour via AI? Will it stop the increased concentration of capital? Will it stop climate “change”? I do for instance believe labour unions can achieve a few of these things. But when labour will in fact endanger the ruling order it will clash violently with state and corporate power. I.e. that labour will have to act well beyond the rights granted by free speech and arm itself. In the face of material force free speech in itself is worthless. That´s what facsism means. When free speech does threaten ruling power only on the surface you already can see what happens. They will use a tiny bit of judicial force to stop it. What if you push further? What if all BSW-voters in Germany had gone to the street and would have demanded a recount of the votes? What if protesters storm the US nuclear storage at Büchel base in Germany? Freedom of speech – or lets say diplomacy – did not help the Russians in preempting a war with 1.3M KIA on both sides. As Capone says in THE UNTOUCHABLES “With a gun and a nice word you achieve more than just a nice word.” What is free speech worth if we dare not question the capitalist structure underneath it? What is free speech worth if we have no means to enforce it against the state? What is free speech worth if the people who have the means to push for political change are so brain-washed that they in fact support the above mentioned WWIII policies or a genocide. Naturally this is a polemic comment and I am putting forward talking points which I still do not believe but I must contend with current realities. It is also a very personal reaction to the political fallout which we have experienced since 2024 in particular. As the necessity to resist couldn´t be more obvious. But never have we been further away from a viable political opposition with the Left – that usually held up that option – completely in tatters, or better, paid off. I am not argueing that we have completely run out of options with the use of free speech rights. But right now I am pessimistic it will in fact change anything beyond the cosmetic level. p.s. In his latest podcast Doug Henwood had two regulars as guests to his show. They spoke about the PMC. Henwood being Henwood I need not go into further detail. But there was this one point: The guests suggested that one reason for a possible demise of the genuine left originating in the 1960s was the idea of many academics then to change the system from the inside and decided to enter the system – after – and this is the interesting part – coming to the conclusion that the protest did not seriously end Vietnam but changes within the system did. I don´t know about the evidence for that. It´s complicated to prove any such point. Much of it being smart PR by pseudo-leftists I would suspect. I have all my life been in favour of protest. And I have always been of the opinion that protest (i.e. the First) did end Vietnam. But comments like this make me think. Especially if a Daniel Ellsberg 2 years ago mused that may be it was not the protest that brought down Nixon, not his own Pentagon Paper leaks and not a seminal SCOTUS decision “NYT & Co vs. US” – but a Howard Dean. Howard Dean, or John Dean? “Of course John Dean. What did you think. I was only testing you.” Shit. Thanks. Sorry. I seem to like making these slips… and it´s not the first time with Dean. And I really don´t know why. My memory of Howard Dean is very murky. Mine too!! Poor guy. He didn´t deserve it, did he? I do believe he opposed Iraq. p.s. Who among D.C.s big shots today opposed Iraq??? (AOC I assume wasn´t even born, so she´s lucky and excused.) Yes, I’m sure he did. Obama sure didn’t. He wasn’t that great on Universal Health care for everyone though I did work for him at the time.It was an optimistic campaign. Re: Iran will target Chagos “When the time comes, it won’t matter whether you’re an American, British, or Turkish soldier – you will be targeted if your base is used by Americans.” Uh oh! Goodbye Al Udeid! We won’t miss you! Prosecutors directed to seek death penalty against UnitedHealthcare killing suspect Luigi Mangione AP “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statement. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” And thus are Martyrs made. “Brian Thompson—an innocent man” Only because he was never charged for his crimes. The wealthy sins and mistakes, which all need forgiveness, while the poor have crimes and sins, which are unforgivable and require punishment. Money really does wash away one’s guilt. It may have “shocked” the powers that be and the oligarchs in charge, but down here on the ground “shocked” isn’t the word I’d use to describe the reaction. File under Guillotine Watch Canadians thinking of voting for Mark Carney as next Prime Minister might be interested in this: https://www.westernstandard.news/news/revealed-mark-carney-wears-2000-sneakers/62085 Re Marine Le Pen: I have no particular insight into French politics, so I will only point out that stealing/diverting a scant 4m Euro over the course of 11 years is truly Mickey Mouse League corruption. And they couldn’t even cover their tracks? Amateurs, mere amateurs. Sigh. There is a lot to say and the case is still developing. But French law is pretty strict on the financing of political parties, and there have been a number of similar prosecutions in recent years. Former President Sarkozy, already convicted of fiddling election expenses, is on trial for receiving campaign contributions from Libya amounting to millions of Euros, at least. But the point here is not the crime (which is pretty well established) but the punishment. The judge had a great deal of discretion in the punishment awarded, and opted for the harshest available: disqualification with immediate effect, even while an appeal is being mounted. That means that Le Pen cannot present herself in 2027, it means that the party itself probably won’t be able to find another candidate, and that the whole complexion of French politics has just been altered by one judge who could easily have awarded a sentence that was less harsh. Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence. >”Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence.” Which does confirm a Walter Kirn (sorry to bother with him who is no expert on foreign affairs) who I have criticized just yesterday for alluding to this very problem. I cross-posted this with yesterdays article on not accepting or sending checks for US taxes… Holy mackerel! I was reviewing the US Treasury’s Daily Statement trying to get a picture of tax inflows from tariffs from a before perspective. While I was reviewing it I came across 2 line items that when viewed together shocked me… (fiscal year to date numbers)… inflows/deposits to the Treasury… Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Electronic $164,358M Taxes – Non Withheld Ind/SECA Other $126,061M These line items relate to taxes paid by individuals that were not withheld from payroll or collected in advance for other reasons… the money owed after you complete your return if you did not receive a refund. While I’m not 100% confident I have identified the best/fullest answer, but from what I’ve been able to glean the difference between Electronic and Other is tied to whether you filed your return electronically of via paper where “Other” is primarily paper filed returns. I’d suspect they call it Other because it likely also includes legal judgements regardless of your original type of filing. While it is technically possible to file on paper and pay electronically via the IRS web portal, I would highly suspect the correlation is that paper filings include a paper check! At least at the dollar level, the ratio is 1 : .75. That’s a lot of paper checks (or their dollar equivalent) to force to electronic payment in the next 6 months or so! While I do suspect some of those paper returns & checks are very high dollar value, I still think it directionally points to a significant volume of people who are paying their taxes in paper check form (or equivalent such as a money order). Don’t know, but like lots of people without W-2 income or mandatory 1099 withholding I make estimated tax payment by check throughout the year. I did notice my 15 Jan check processed by Cincinnati came back as “converted to ACH”. Think that’s a first. Hope Hawaii doesn’t jump on this bandwagon. We pay some business taxes. They keep raising the tax so for one period we got fined for exceeding the dollar limit where you have to file electronically. So now we file electronically but the limit for mandatory electronic payment is higher (and with “convenience fee”) so we still pay by check. Had a three-month span where we were getting dinged for non-payment. Had to call and fax copies of the cleared checks (thankfully, not converted to ACH so you can still get an image of front/back of actual check). No, I’m not going to Zelle my IRS payment. re: Germany vs. Gaza Germany Turns to U.S. Playbook: Deportations Target Gaza War Protesters Objections from a top immigration official that none of the protesters were convicted of crimes were overruled amid political pressure. https://theintercept.com/2025/03/31/germany-gaza-protesters-deport/ A question for the commentariat: What are the power centers in the America of today? There are the spooks and the cops. There are the media including faceborg and X. There are the fusion centers, total information awareness is here. There’s the Military, including the National Guard, which might be problematic because the Military Oath is to “Defend the Constitution from all enemies Foreign and Domestic”. There are the Churches and the various State Governments. Any more?

The sentence applies the law as written, but it turns her embezzlement conviction into a propaganda coup for her party. https://jacobin.com/2025/03/marine-le-pen-embezzlement-propaganda The thrust is obvious but there is also at least this bit: “(…) But banning candidates from running for office due to financial crimes is highly dubious.

As left-wing party France Insoumise pointed out in a statement, the Rassemblement National’s claim to be uniquely “clean” and stand against a corrupt establishment is in tatters. But that is for the electorate to judge.

Title: As Future of Panama Canal Hangs in Balance, Mexico Quietly Begins Testing Its Interoceanic Rail Corridor
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/04/as-future-of-panama-canal-hangs-in-balance-mexico-quietly-inaugurates-its-interoceanic-rail-corridor.html
Time Published: 2025-04-01T10:53:15Z
Full Content:
South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just became the first company to use the rail corridor, which is being touted as a possible plan B to the embattled canal. Just a few weeks ago, the Trump Administration was celebrating what seemed to be an early strategic victory over China in the US’ direct neighbourhood. As readers may recall, a consortium led by the investment fund manager BlackRock had just announced its purchase of 80 percent of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port holdings, giving the consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, including, crucially, the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal. The sale of CK Hutchison’s ports business put “the ports [in Panama] under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane,” noted an Associated Press article. The message was clear: the Trump Administration is not going to stand by and watch as China expands its influence in the US’s own “backyard”, especially over strategic assets like the Panama Canal. To put this in broader context, the attempted buy out of the Panamanian ports came just three months after the opening of the Chinese-financed and -managed deep sea port in Chancay, which as Asia Times reported, signalled “the start of a new era of efficient, high-capacity shipping between China and Peru, with a connection to Brazil across the Andes.” As a measure of Chancay’s importance to the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping even travelled to Peru to inaugurate the mega port (as well as attend the 31st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Lima), where he said: “We are witnessing not only the solid and successful joint implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in Peru, but also the birth of a new land-maritime corridor between Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean in a new era.” Of course, this caused all sort of teeth gnashing in Washington, especially given that Chancay is more advanced than any seaport in the US. Within weeks, US officials were signing a strategic agreement with Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa government that allows the US to install military personnel, weapons and other equipment on the Galapagos islands, a UNESCO Natural Heritage Site in a country whose constitution expressly prohibits the establishment of foreign military bases. The island chain is 1,900 kms from Chancay. Since its inauguration, Trump 2.0 has upped the stakes, showing a clear willingness to use every conceivable tactic, including gangster extortion, to stymie Chinese influence on the American continent, particularly in Mexico and Central America. As Conor recently reported, the Trump administration’s obsession with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure extends beyond the American continent: Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. “Selling Out” the Chinese People Against this complex backdrop, the BlackRock-led consortium’s purchase of CK Hutchison’s port holdings (outside of China and Hong Kong) was set to be consummated with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction by April 2 — that is, tomorrow. But that, alas, will not be happening, at least not any time soon, since Beijing has decided that it, too, can play dirty on the global chessboard. Last week, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said it plans to “review [the sale] in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. As the FT reports, the move came on the back of earlier commentary in the Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, that called the sale a “spineless, grovelling” move that “sells out all Chinese people”. The agreement “in principle” was announced in early March, with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction expected by April 2. However, this is now set to be delayed, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yesterday, the newspaper featured comments from Hong Kong politicians and Chinese lawyers urging the CK Hutchison to rethink the sale of its ports division, which is kind of ironic given that the main point of the sale was to “de-risk” its port holdings. Now, it is caught in the middle of a bitch fight between the world’s two superpowers, for which it has already paid a heavy price. Since news of Beijing’s objections to the sale broke on March 13, the company’s shares have fallen 13%, retracing more than half of the 25% gain after the deal’s announcement. One Ta Kung Pao editorial even suggested that the sale could contravene Hong Kong’s national security laws, known as Article 23. If, as the FT notes, the deal were ultimately blocked, it could have major repercussions not only for Beijing’s already troubled relations with Hong Kong’s business elite but also Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial centre: CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing and his family, has increasingly been caught between Beijing and Washington over the Panama ports since US President Donald Trump complained of Chinese influence over the canal and said the US would be “taking it back”. It is unusual for a Chinese state agency to review a deal involving a Hong Kong-based company. CK Hutchison’s holding company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the conglomerate’s ports in China are excluded from the sale. “Is this a warning shot to others or a look to scuttle this deal?” one person familiar with the deal said. “On paper, the SAMR reviewing how this deal affects the Chinese shipping industry under its anti-monopoly mandate makes a lot of sense. But does anyone really believe that or is this . . . the Chinese scuttling a deal which will then have ramifications on Hong Kong as a financial centre?” “Torpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser at the IMF. “The risks are so high for all involved.” The End of the Belt-and-Road in Panama The deal represented a triumph for the Trump Administration’s geostrategic aspirations in its own neighbourhood as well as a blow to China’s belt-and-road project, given that some 6% of global trade passes through the canal. According to the US International Trade Commission, the Canal “has 46% of the total market share of containers moving from Northeast Asia to the East Coast of the United States.” Panama itself was the first country in Latin America to join China’s Belt-and-Road initiative, in 2017. However, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, under pressure from US Sec of State Marco Rubio, recently said he would withdraw Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review. The CK Hutchison deal was also supposed to mark a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions. According to Bloomberg, Fink had personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The billionaire CEO reportedly boasted of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. But apparently not in Beijing. For Trump, the deal was all about “reclaiming” the canal for the United States — a message that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not gone down well in Panama. This is a country wearily accustomed to US military interventions, the last of which took place in 1989 with George H W Bush’s invasion and toppling of Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama’s strong arm dictator (1983-9) and former CIA asset and go-between during the US’ dirty wars in Central America. Much like Saddam Hussein a few years later, Noriega thought he could go his own way. Trump has repeatedly denounced that US ships pay exorbitant prices to transit the waterway, though they, in fact, pay the same rates as ships of any other flag. But the deal is now on ice anyway, meaning that other options, including military ones, are back on the table. US-Style “Partnering” With Panama Even before Chinese regulators put the stick in the spokes, the Trump Administration had already directed the US military to draw up plans to increase the American troop presence in Panama, according to information leaked to NBC. As the NBC article notes, the amount of military force used will depend on the extent to which Panama is willing to, ahem, “partner” with the US: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Trump seems to believe that the US has, at the very least, joint, if not full, ownership rights over the canal due to the fact that the US government and banks financed its construction between 1904 and 1914. What happened just before 1904 is often forgotten or overlooked, however. The veteran US journalist Ken Silverstein jogged a few memories in his 2014 article for Vice, : “In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia into handing over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them JP Morgan & Co, which was appointed as the country’s ‘fiscal agent’ in charge of managing $10m in aid that the US had rushed down to the new nation.” US interests were myriad: on the one hand, Washington wanted access to, and control over, the canal that French builders had begun but failed to finish in the 1880s. At the same time, Wall Street banks were keen to create a new nation that would primarily serve their interests. As John Pilger reported for The Guardian in 2016, it was JP Morgan that would lead the American banks in gradually transforming Panama into “a financial centre – and a haven for tax evasion and money laundering – as well as a passage for shipping.” Washington maintained control of the interoceanic waterway until 1977 during which time when then-US President Jimmy Carter signed with the then Panamanian leader, Omar Torrijos, the cession of US control of the facility 22 years later. The agreement came after years of protests in Panama against US occupation but was widely criticised by US conservatives at the time and is seen by Trump as a “serious mistake.” But the Panama Canal has lost some of its lustre since the jungle country suffered an unprecedented drought in 2023. As we noted a few weeks ago, the BlackRock-led consortium’s participation in the canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). As Tom Neuburger wrote in a Jan 2024 article we cross-posted here, the plans to “fix” the Canal sound like plans to “fix” the climate: Bill Gates-style high tech fantasies. [Bloomberg] “In the long term, the primary solution to chronic water shortages will be to dam up the Indio River and then drill a tunnel through a mountain to pipe fresh water 8 kilometers (5 miles) into Lake Gatún, the canal’s main reservoir.” That’s a $2 billion project if it comes in on budget. But is it a long-term fix? Bloomberg admits that Panama “will need to dam even more rivers to guarantee water through the end of the century.” Sounds like Band-Aids to me. Lots of them. And residents of the to-be-flooded land are vigorously opposed, so it will be a political fight to move them. “Another potential fix is decidedly more experimental … cloud seeding, the process of implanting large salt particles into clouds to boost the condensation that creates rain.” The article is not optimistic that this will work. Another Gatesian dream: Pretty. Impossible. Or to say that differently, pretty impossible. Plan B Option: Mexico? As the future of the Panama Canal hangs in the balance, Mexico has begun pilot testing the Interoceanic Rail Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (also known by its Spanish initials, CIIT). On Friday, a ship chartered by the Hyundai Motor Company docked at the Pacific port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca. Its cargo, 600 Hyundai vehicles, were unloaded and placed on a freight train that then set off across the Isthmus, Mexico’s narrowest land bridge, to the port of Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, where the cargo was loaded onto another boat destined for the US’ East Coast. And just like that, the first genuine rival route, or perhaps better put, complementary route, to the Panama Canal was born. Or perhaps better put, reborn. You see, most of the infrastructure for the project was built over a century ago. In fact, the 188-mile railroad joining the two main ports was opened in 1907, seven years before the inauguration of the Panama Canal, and within no time was plying as many as 60 trains a day carrying things like sugar from the Caribbean on their way to the US West Coast. But its success was short lived. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the railroads were increasingly used to transport weapons and troops rather than freight. Four years later, the Panama Canal opened, offering a more attractive route to international businesses. Gradually, over time Mexico’s interoceanic railroad system fell into disrepair, and while recent governments in Mexico have talked about rebooting the system, it wasn’t until Andrés Manuel López Obrador (aka AMLO) took power in 2018 that the words actually turned into action. As we reported in September 2023, if completed and done well, it will probably represent the most important infrastructure project of Lopéz Obrador’s presidency. The goal is not just to turn Mexico into a logistics powerhouse but also to spread wealth across the country by boosting economic opportunities in Mexico’s poorer, long-neglected southern states (Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, etc). This will largely be through the development of ten industrial parks, or so-called “free zones”, along the route. The project will also include the construction of four new highways, three airports, a gas pipeline and a fibre-optic network, and already boasts a ten-stop passenger train service. As the problems stack up in Panama, other interoceanic land routes are coming under consideration, including a rival canal in neighbouring Nicaragua, which almost got built instead of the Panama Canal at the turn of the 20th century, as well as interoceanic rail corridors in Honduras and Colombia. But for the moment Mexico’s CIIT has one clear advantage over all these other projects: it is close to completion, and that is largely thanks to all the work undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “An Exceptional Project” While the journey time of the CIIT (6-7 hours) is slightly shorter than the Panama Canal (8-10 hours), you also have to add in the time it takes to load and unload thousands of shipping containers off a ship onto a train and then back on to a ship at the other end. According to a video report by the Wall Street Journal in September last year, “Mexico still has a lot of work to do to get its ports ready for a large influx of cargo”. This was a point that President Sheinbaum herself addressed in her Monday morning press conference: “Several very important cranes are about to arrive. There will also be a storage facility for grains that is also important, and other actions to strengthen the port of Salina Cruz and that will allow freer movement. It is an exceptional project that provides an alternative to the Panama Canal, and when the port of Salina Cruz is complete, it will have much more activity.” The total transit time for the Hyundai cargo was around 72 hours, according to local sources. Granted, this was the first pilot test carried out with a large cargo of vehicles but it still compares unfavourably with the Panama Canal — unless of course one takes into account the possible waiting times for ships before passage through the canal, which during periods of low rain can mean days or even weeks of hanging around off Panama’s coastline. During the 2023 drought, waiting times reached as long as 14 days, leaving some carriers little choice but to bid millions in extra fees to jump the line. Another advantage of the CIIT for a shipment from, say, South Korea to New York is that you wouldn’t have to go all the way down to Panama, navigate the canal and then go all the way back up again. Also, the long-term goal of Mexico’s interoceanic rail corridor is to bring the journey time down to low double or even single-digit figures as the logistics systems at the two ports gain in efficiency. According to the WSJ report, it should ultimately take around 15 hours for cargos to pass through Mexico. But as Mexican journalist Agustín García Villa notes, the success of a project of this scale and grandeur will require many things, including a trained workforce, technology, super-rapid processing of containers at the ports (which is good for all businesses, including, of course, drug trafficking ones), reliable energy sources, and the development of properly urbanised mid-sized cities that guarantee an adequate supply of housing, schools, hospitals, health centres, energy and markets. It will also depend on the amount of security Mexico’s marines can provide to the strategic infrastructure. All of that, in turn, will require a steady flow of significant investment as well as long-term political commitment. The former is, for the moment, amply covered, with money coming in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. Put simply, big business, not just from the US, wants this project to happen. So, too, does the Claudia Sheinbaum government, which took over the reins of power from AMLO last October. Ultimately, as the WSJ report concludes, Mexico’s re-emerging interoceanic rail corridor is unlikely to rival Panama Canal in terms of capacity or speed of transit even once complete. But it could serve as a very useful complement. As Doctor Yasmine Sabri, associate professor of logistics at University College London, tells the WSJ, rather than competing with each other, perhaps the two could work together by sharing data, enabling them to reroute vessels whenever there is a chokepoint, whether it is in Panama or Mexico. However, big questions still remain. For instance, how much opposition will the construction of industrial parks in Oaxaca and Veracruz face from local indigenous communities? If there is strong resistance, how will the Sheinbaum government respond? Like AMLO before her, Sheinbaum prides herself on representing indigenous rights and voices. It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project as and when it gradually comes on line. Of course, Trump will have somewhat more difficulty bullying Mexico into submission than it did Panama, but it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention. Will Chinese companies be interested in investing in the industrial parks along the route, as it has done in so many other infrastructure projects in southern Mexico? Much will depend on whether Mexico continues to serve as a point of entry for competitively priced manufactured goods into the US market, which cannot be taken for granted. Of course, Washington will try to talk Mexico out of accepting any offers of Chinese funds. Mexico, like Panama, finds itself caught in a tussle between two apex superpowers, and is already paying a heavy price. US pressure to impose equivalent tariffs on Chinese goods continues to rise. To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam. If the Trump administration does try to impose its will on Mexico’s re-emerging trade route as it has tried to do with the Panama Canal, so far unsuccessfully, it will heap even further pressure on the rapidly fracturing global trade system. And if this goes on for long enough, global trade volumes will ultimately begin to fall, perhaps even obviating the need for so many transoceanic trade routes in the first place. “It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project…it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention.” I recall seeing a report somewhere that five guys in a boat were seen leaving the Baltic Sea and heading south into the Atlantic Ocean, carrying several strange tall objects about the height of ICBM’s as cargo. But to what ends is Trump trying to control China? The majority of the ships through the Panama Canal go to the US. Many go from east to west coast of the US. Some from Europe to west coast, others Asia to east coast. And since the US is a major importer, any shutting of the canal/ports would hurt the US more than China. While he might not care, I’m not so sure the vast majority of Americans won’t. The rail would allow the largest MGX-24 (24,000 TEU) to dock. As they are way to big for the canal. From what can find a fully automated port can load/empty 24k in 12 hrs. I wonder how the costs of doing this is vs the cost of the canal transit and adding many days of waiting time? Well, it seems unlikely that the port will be as well run under BlackRock (who will be incentivized to run it down and then dump the mess on the US govt) than under its current CHinese management. See what BlackRock and its ilk have done to US health care and so many other industries – maximize profit, enshitify service, skip maintenance. Waiting to use the word ‘enshitify’ so late in that excellent point was a class move. Thanks for the lesson. It’s an interesting project and more so because it is an updated 19th century scheme. It will never replace the canal but that is not it’s intent. I can see it being used to ship cargo on a reliable timetable which is no longer true of the Panama canal due to problems with water supplies declining which the canal needs to operate. You know what might be interesting? If China came in and built a high-speed rail running parallel the the cargo railway to connect up all those communities in that corridor. Thanks for the great report. It may be time to consider whether the defeat of the last administration was a blow to hegemony–the “blob”–or has brought us hegemony on steroids as embodied in one very flawed personality and his increasingly sycophantic staff. So far hegemony 2 consists of the considerable hot air that comes out of Trump’s mouth but should he indeed start a war with Iran, or even Panama, it will be the American people who will also suffer as we join Netanyahu in the rogue nation category. The public tolerated and even applauded “we’re an empire now” under the Bush Jr. regime but then had considerable buyer’s remorse as Iraq and Afghanistan turned sour and endless. The Dems got it wrong about Trump who is nothing like Hitler but may be very much like the foolish Kaiser Wilhelm with his obsession with his costumes and inferiority complex. The adults running Trump’s many would be targets need to assert themselves and seem to be doing so. Moon suggests a walkback of Trump’s unhinged Sunday rant toward Putin https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/03/russigates-role-in-trump-putin-relations.html So is it another “360” by the Donald? Or is he merely willing to be reasonable with nuclear armed Russia but not all those “shitty little countries” as he called them like Yemen and Panama? Is it still kick down/suck up? The psychodrama is getting old fast. If you’re ever in Panama City, I urge you to visit the Canal Museum. Quietly–movingly–it underscores the incredible racism that underlay the canal’s construction, beginning to end, the 27,000-plus deaths that came with it. The entire world thinks that Panama runs the canal better than we did and the Panamanian people (including my students there during the summer of ’23) are proud of the fact. Incidents like the murder of 22 students who wanted to fly their country’s flag at Balboa High School in the Canal Zone in 1964–not to mention the flattening, with more than 200 completely unnecessary deaths, of the poor Panama City El Chorillo neighborhood during our invasion–are not forgotten. We forget how hard it is to invade and hold a country. We will find out once more if we choose to go into places like Iran or Panama. Very rough math: For a 20,000 TEU (assume max container ship) = 20,000 TEUs / 250 TEUs per train = 80 trains to move containers from coast to coast. For a 5,000 car Ro-Ro, 12 cars per autorack, 417 autorack rail cars, so about 4.5 trains. Loading/unloading autoracks/Ro-Ro is much faster than loading containers too, maybe about 24 hours turnaround. So it looks to me like it’s feasible for autos and probably bulk, but perhaps not for containers and intermodal? I guess i am behind the curve. “To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam.” But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place. Wasn’t Obambam excluding China from the TPP when he was in office? Then Hillary finally came out against the TPP at the end of her campaign? “But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place.” My guess is that Chinese steel enters Malaysia and Vietnam through the already deep trade ties Beijing has with these countries, and then some of that steel ends up heading towards Mexico under the preferential conditions of the TPP. The economist Robert E Scott warned about this happening wrt the US in an article for the Economic Policy Institute in late 2016, just months before Trump walked away from the deal. Here’s the intro: President Obama has built his closing case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a political argument, saying “…we can’t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules.” But it is both arrogant and wrong to think that the United States has the power to shape the rules governing China’s relationship to TPP signatories. As of today, China has already established deeper trade ties than the United States with the TPP nations. Further, congressional approval of the TPP would actually lock in those advantages for China. China has a large trade surplus with the TPP countries, and crucial terms of the agreement (specifically weak rules of origin (ROO) requirements, which we’ll talk about in detail below) would provide a back-door guarantee for China and other non-TPP members to duty-free access to U.S. and other TPP markets. Thanks Nick Vera Cruz is the starting point for past invasions of Mexico (Cortes, re the Conquest & General Scot re Mexico _US treaty of Gaudalupe Hidalgo). In 1900, work started on the Kansas City, Mexico , and Orient Railway (now El Chepe in Mexico across the Copper Canyon) which was to connect the US to the Pacific. The advantage of the Mexican connecection is that if the land transit times are short and if the offloading/loading logistics are efficient, then Pacific (Asia) -Mexico boats could carry loads a shorter direction in both directions. Like wise , boats leaving Vera Cruz could consolidate their Pacific cargo for points towards the Atlantic , etc. Also, in November Nicarauga President Ortega proposed to China to build a Atlantic/Pacific Canal through that country. The Panama Canal is not without its difficulties. Be careful what you wish for, if the US ‘reclaims’, it gets to service the operation, etc. Don’t understand the importance of Balboa and Cristobal (container I assume?) ports to cross-canal shipping? Have some interest as my father was stationed in Coco Solo during WWII as a flying boat engine mechanic. He also deployed with a detachment from his squadron to the Galapagos Islands which was used as a flying boat logistics center (in the last half of the war Japanese subs were considered the primary threat). So its not like a US base in Galapagos is something new (Army Air Force also had a bomber base there). From the Galapagos Conservancy: The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 enhanced the strategic importance of the Galapagos Islands as a potential refueling station for trans-oceanic transport. In 1911, the US suggested a 99-year lease of the islands in return for US$15 million. Later, the US and Ecuador discussed the rental or purchase of San Cristóbal, or of the whole archipelago. With the advent of the Second World War, the strategic significance of Galapagos grew, and, in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and with concern about Japanese actions in East Asia, the US approached Ecuador with the idea of establishing a US airbase on Baltra Island to protect the Panama Canal. At the end of 1941, US forces arrived from the Panama Canal Zone. In 1942, the US Sixth Air Force constructed the air base which was to have important long-term consequences for the islands. In 1943, this base was home to 2,474 US officers and men and 750 civilian laborers; as such, this was the largest colonization of the islands to that date. In 1941, the civilian population of the Galapagos Islands was 810 people. The arrival of so many people increased the demand for water, fish, and agricultural products, and threw a lifeline to the people eking out a livelihood on the islands. Base crews constructed a water pipeline from the highlands to Wreck Bay, in San Cristóbal, and used barges to transport water to Baltra Island. The availability of water in Wreck Bay made San Cristóbal more attractive to immigration and meant that people could move down to live in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. The greatest legacy was the construction of the first land-based airport in the islands—now modernized to serve as the main entry point for most travelers to the Galapagos Islands. The US closed the air base in 1946; residents dismantled the structures left behind, using the components to build many of the early houses in Puerto Ayora and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Also, in 2023, over a year before Trump 2.0 took power, the head of the US Southern Command, Laura Richardson, underscored the Chinese presence in critical infrastructure in Latin America as a threat to US national security and hence the importance of maritime dominance to counter it. She highlighted the presence of five Chinese companies along the Panama Canal and the strategic value of the new port in Chancay, Peru. Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink Says Bitcoin to Outperform USD: New Crypto to Ride the Next Rally

BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, says that the US dollar risks losing its dominance to Bitcoin, a sentiment shared by political heavyweights like Senator Cynthia Lummis. We take a look at how pro-crypto assertions like these could help rally the market and fuel new crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). ‘If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,’ Fink stated in his annual letter to investors. The letter touched upon several core problems that plague US society today, including the average American’s poor financial literacy and the need to democratize investments. Fink warned that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and gradual public adoption over the years could soon threaten the supremacy of the US dollar: The solution to the US’s current financial and economic problems, Fink believes, can be found in digital assets because ‘tokenization is democratization’ and Bitcoin leads the way. That these statements come from BlackRock lends even more weight, knowing that the company’s trademark iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds over 570K $BTC, worth over $48B. Furthermore, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund has received a series of $USDC inflows, with the latest valued at $7M, for a total of $33M over the past three days. If tokenization is the future, Blackrock is already there. Staunch crypto advocate, Senator Lummis echoes Fink’s views on X. After announcing the Bitcoin Act back in July 2024, meant to increase the US Federal Reserve’s Bitcoin pool to over $1M, she clapped back at Congress yesterday for not passing the Act fast enough. She then pressed the gas pedal one post later with a blunt: ‘Say it with me: Pass the BITCOIN Act.’ in response to Fink’s statements. The signs are clear: no matter how bearish the markets are right now, the crypto sphere is entering an era of unprecedented top-level support and widespread adoption, with $BTC leading the way. In this context, it’s good to keep an eye on some of the best new crypto that could be part of the next bull run. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project with ambitions to upgrade Solana’s ecosystem and deliver lower fees and faster on-chain transactions. The project promises to rectify core problems with Solana’s current performance, like failed transactions, long downtimes during network outages, and frequent network congestion. As the team achieves its milestones, the devs post regular updates on their work schedule. The latest update focused on their collaboration with Sovereign to achieve faster transaction processing and greater TPS (Transactions per Second). The presale is ongoing, having raised over $28M so far, with the price of $SOLX sitting at $0.00168. This strong early performance makes it one of the best presales in 2025, along with the 142% APY designed to attract stakers and early investors. Tokenomics data: Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the most promising meme coins, thanks to its links to Bitcoin proper. The project attracts investors with long-term $BTC airdrops, each coming at key $BTC price points ($150K, $200K, etc.), and if you hold the tokens in Best Wallet. $BTBULL was born from the idea that $BTC will eventually reach and surpass the $1M market evaluation. As such, the developer team aims to hype up investors to support Bitcoin’s bull run, in turn, dragging Bitcoin Bull Token along for the ride. The presale has raised $4.3M so far, with the $BTCBULL price sitting at a still super low $0.00244. Staking is at 97% currently, with a staking pool of over 1B. Tokenomics data: OpenSea ($SEA) is the first and biggest NFT marketplace in the game. If you want to buy, sell, and mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art, collectibles, music, virtual property, this is the place to be. The company launched its beta in February of this year and recommends itself as a ‘fully reimagined product’ for NFT collectors and pro investors. It promises to bring several key features, including native cross-chain purchasing, 0% swap fees, and an unmatched collection of different markets. $SEA is set to have its public launch in 2025, but it doesn’t have an official date yet. Until that happens, you can interact with the OpenSea world right now if you’re a fan of tokenized art. All three covered above are viable new token projects to keep an eye on as the crypto verse expands. The question isn’t whether Bitcoin will rally, but when. After all, we live in a universe where financial mammoths like Blackrock and US political figures like Cynthia Lummis are pushing hard for adoption while highlighting Bitcoin’s superiority over USD. Who would’ve believed it back in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published his little 9-page paper, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’? As always, there’s no holding back progress. That said, this is not financial advice. DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before investing and have a solid risk management strategy in place to minimize losses.

ByChase Peterson-Withorn ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. The world’s billionaires have always been rich and powerful—but never more than now. That’s particularly true in the United States, where Donald Trump was sworn in (again) as America’s billionaire-in-chief in January. This time around, he’s giving the billionaire class more control over the government than ever before. His right-hand man is the planet’s richest person. His administration includes at least ten billionaires and billionaire spouses. And scores of billionaire execs—from Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault—have lined up behind Trump. The billionaire bonanza extends beyond the U.S., however. A record 3,028 people around the globe make Forbes’ annual World’s Billionaires list this year, 247 more than last year. It’s the first time the billionaire population has crossed the 3,000 mark. They’re worth a record $16.1 trillion in all, $2 trillion more than a year ago and more than the GDP of every country in the world besides the U.S. and China. The average fortune now stands at $5.3 billion, up $200 million from 2024. There are now three people worth more than $200 billion for the first time ever, part of the record 15 members of the $100 Billion Club, the elite group at the very top of the list whose net worths span a dozen digits. That’s up from 14 a year ago and none in 2017. These 15 centibillionaires are worth $2.4 trillion—more than the bottom 1,500 billionaires combined. The richest of all is Elon Musk, worth an estimated $342 billion. Despite spending a lot more of his (already divided) time heading DOGE, Trump’s cost-cutting operation, Musk has added $147 billion to his fortune over the past year, thanks to a blockbuster year for his rocket company SpaceX and his AI firm xAI (which he merged with his social media giant X last week). Even Tesla, despite recent protests and a stock market selloff, is trading higher than a year ago. That’s allowed Musk to reclaim the title of world’s richest person from Arnault, and has given him a $126 billion lead over the next richest person: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $216 billion), who ranks No. 2 for the first time. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($215 billion) ranks No. 3 and Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($192 billion) ranks fourth. Arnault ($178 billion), meanwhile, slides down to fifth, his lowest rank since 2017, amid a slump in shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH. Forbes used stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025 for this year’s ranking. The United States, with a record 902 billionaire citizens, continues to boast more billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. China, with 516 (including Hong Kong), remains second and India, with 205, still ranks third. More than 50% of all listees are citizens of one of these three countries, but altogether 76 nations and two semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire, including Albania for the first time ever. Forbes also added 15 from Saudi Arabia this year, after removing the Kingdom’s billionaires in 2018 following a government crackdown. In all, 288 fresh faces join the annual Billionaires ranking this year. That includes celebrities such as rockstar Bruce Springsteen ($1.2 billion), movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1.1 billion) and comedian Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion). Also new: controversial crypto kingpin Justin Sun ($8.5 billion), several artificial intelligence tycoons from such companies as Anthropic, CoreWeave and DeepSeek, and the moguls behind several notable food chains: Cava, Chipotle, Jersey Mike’s and Zaxby’s. The wealthiest newcomer of all is Marilyn Simons ($31 billion), the widow of hedge fund legend Jim Simons, who died in May 2024. He was one of 32 billionaires who died over the past year. (Another, Israeli industrial titan Stef Wertheimer, died in late March, after we locked in the list, and thus appears in the ranks.) Simons is one of just 406 women among the World’s Billionaires, only 13.4% of the list, up a hair from 13.3% last year. Nearly three-quarters inherited their fortunes. That includes the world’s richest woman, Walmart heir Alice Walton ($101 billion), who has overtaken French L’Oreal heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion) for the top spot among women. Forbes found just 113 self-made women around the globe, the richest of whom is Swiss shipping tycoon Rafaela Aponte-Diamant ($37.7 billion) whose company teamed with BlackRock this year on a plan to buy 43 ports, including two in Panama. Overall, 67% of the list is self-made—meaning they founded or cofounded their company or established their own fortune, rather than inheriting it—up from 66% in 2024. The youngest self-made billionaire is Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), who is 28. Wang is one of just 21 billionaires who are 30 or younger, including Johannes von Baumbach ($5.4 billion), a 19-year-old heir to a German pharmaceuticals fortune, a newcomer who is now the world’s youngest billionaire. The oldest billionaire, at age 103, is U.S. insurance tycoon George Joseph ($1.9 billion), one of four listees who have hit the century mark. The average billionaire is 66 years old. Few billionaires have had a better year than Donald Trump—and not just because he retook the U.S. presidency. Before moving back into the White House, he padded his cash pile with a very lucrative move into crypto. Between that and his Trump Media & Technology Group going public just after Forbes locked in its 2024 rankings, the president’s net worth has more than doubled, from an estimated $2.3 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion. A small handful of billionaires, relatively speaking, didn’t fare so well. A total of 107 people who were on the 2024 ranking are simply no longer rich enough to make the cut. Notable drop-offs include Lisa Su, who is the CEO of semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sara Liu, cofounder of embattled server and storage maker Supermicro; and Nicholas Puech, an heir to the Hermès luxury goods empire who says his fortune has vanished. The World’s Billionaires list is a ranking of every person on the planet who Forbes estimated to have a net worth of $1 billion U.S. dollars or more as of March 7, 2025. Some billionaires have gotten richer or poorer in the time since; indeed, Forbes found three more billionaires shortly after locking in this year’s list and there are likely more out there. Like most of our readers, we’re also bracing for the impact of tariffs on the global stock market. For daily updated rankings, see Forbes’ Real-Time tracker. When possible, we met with billionaires in person or spoke with them virtually or by phone. We also interviewed their employees, handlers, asset managers and financial advisors, rivals, peers and attorneys. Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory documents, court filings, probate records and news articles. We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more. We factored in known debt and charitable giving. We exclude dispersed family fortunes, though we list wealth belonging to the immediate family of the living founder of a fortune under the founder’s name. In some cases, we also include wealth held by the immediate family member of an heir. In either of those instances, you’ll see “& family” in a person’s listing.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Title: US Dollar To Lose Reserve Status If Investors View Bitcoin As A Safer Bet — BlackRock CEO

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has warned that the U.S. Dollar could lose its reserve status to Bitcoin. This comes on the heels of plunging global financial markets and rising domestic debt. The dollar has faced external pressure in recent months, with many suggesting Bitcoin’s adoption could pose a slight threat to the currency. In a new letter to investors, Larry Fink expressed concerns over the U.S. dollar’s dominance. He further highlighted the successes of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential of decentralized finance globally. According to him, the currency has enjoyed dominance for decades but is not a future guarantee. Bitcoin adoption, on the other hand, has grown exponentially in the last decade and could become a global currency if investors see it as a safer bet. Previously, traditional players viewed Bitcoin as high risk, warning clients against gaining exposure to the market. At the moment, institutional investors have increased their crypto exposure amid wider acceptance across several levels. Institutional appetite fueled Bitcoin to a $2 trillion market cap before headwinds hit major assets. The US dollar has been affected by rising debt and increased government spending. While inflation turns investors to other assets, Bitcoin is tipped as a hedge against inflationary trends. “The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paved the way for institutional investors and added legitimacy. These funds triggered wider adoption, taking the asset’s price to new all-time highs. After several products attracted nearly $40 billion in total assets, investors have delved into other crypto ETFs. BlackRock stood out as a major player in the space, with its Bitcoin product igniting other market participants. The firm’s total ETF arm recorded about $22 billion in net inflows last year. Bitcoin remained crucial as the crypto ETFs dominated narratives in 2024.

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 31, 2025 04:46 PM In response to a question regarding a report that that China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it will review CK Hutchison's potential sale of relevant port assets to a BlackRock-led consortium, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Monday at a prese briefing that he has noted the report that the SAMR will review the deal in accordance with the law, with the aim of protecting market fairness and safeguarding public interests. China's top market regulator said on Friday it will carry out an antitrust review of CK Hutchison's possible Panama Canal ports' deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to the website of the SAMR. Guo said that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rolloutâurging immediate action to decentralize assets. In a chilling warning on Decentralized TV, investment strategist Chris Sullivan outlined two catastrophic economic collapse scenariosâhyperinflation from unchecked money printing or a deflationary spiral triggering mass debt defaults. His most alarming revelation? The looming threat of the "Great Taking"âa global elite scheme to confiscate wealth through centralized financial controls. Sullivan, a seasoned financial expert with decades of experience, urged viewers to "exit fiatânow" and embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, including Bitcoin, privacy coins, and precious metals. His insights reveal that institutional investors are already hedging against systemic failure by quietly moving into crypto, while stablecoins like Tether could become lifelines if traditional banking collapses. The Two Economic Doomsday Scenarios Sullivan warned that the U.S. dollar system faces two potential death spirals: Hyperinflation â The Federal Reserveâs endless money printing could render the dollar worthless, mirroring Weimar Germany or modern-day Venezuela. Deflationary Collapse â A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isnât going to even know theyâre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional bankingâwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" â A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assetsâhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, youâve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoptionâeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivanâs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivanâs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out.

"Theyâre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivanâs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokensâat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiatânow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivanâs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out. Watch the full episode of the "Decentralized TV" with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, Todd Pitner and Chris Sullivan as they talk about Deflation vs. Hyperinflation.

Deflationary Collapse â A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isnât going to even know theyâre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional bankingâwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" â A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assetsâhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, youâve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoptionâeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivanâs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivanâs timeline?

Title: Why is China angry about a plan to sell two ports on the Panama Canal?

Beijing’s displeasure over conglomerate’s plans highlights tightening business environment in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison, one of the largest conglomerates in Hong Kong, earlier this month announced plans to sell its stake in two ports on the Panama Canal to a group of US investors led by BlackRock. The plan, part of a $22.8bn megadeal that would grant the consortium control over more than 40 ports in 23 countries, followed complaints by United States President Donald Trump that the key shipping route was under Chinese control. CK Hutchison shares soared following news of the deal on March 4, but plunged less than two weeks later when Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-run newspaper in Hong Kong, accused the company in two op-eds of “spineless grovelling” and cutting a deal “that betrayed and sold out all Chinese people”. With an April 2 deadline to sign the deal looming, CK Hutchison is now in the crosshairs of both Washington and Beijing. Why would China want to stop the deal? Editorials in Ta Kung Pao, which is controlled by Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong through a subsidiary, are often read as signals from the upper ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kong leader John Lee, who was elected as the sole candidate in an election tightly controlled by Beijing, has criticised the CK Hutchison deal, saying it deserves “serious attention”. The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. On Friday, China’s market regulator said on its official WeChat account that it would carry out an antitrust investigation “in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. Following the news, local media, including the Sing Tao Daily and the South China Morning Post, reported that CK Hutchison would not go forward with the deal this week. What is Beijing’s relationship with CK Hutchison? The proposed sale has also highlighted longstanding tensions between Beijing and CK Hutchison and its 96-year-old billionaire founder, Li Ka-shing. Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. In 2015, Li raised eyebrows when he restructured his business interests and registered them in the Cayman Islands. Around this time, he also began to divest from China. In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. While analysts have offered differing opinions on whether the Li family tacitly supported calls for democracy in Hong Kong, there is broad agreement that it is less visibly pro-Beijing than many of the city’s other business dynasties. “Compared to other family offices of his generation – such as the Fok and Pao family, who invested in the mainland as early as the 1980s, or the Tung family, who are active in Sino-American relations and Hong Kong governance – Li and his sons position themselves as businesspeople who invest globally and distance themselves from politics,” Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute, told Al Jazeera. Can Beijing stop the sale from going ahead? Chan said Beijing is relatively constrained in terms of formal regulatory authority to stop the deal. “In strict legal terms, it will be quite difficult for Beijing and Hong Kong to call off the deal, given the companies and the ports involved are not ‘legally’ located within the jurisdiction of China and Hong Kong,” he said. Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong barrister and member of the city’s Executive Council, said the antitrust investigation could be seen as a “deterrent” against CK Hutchison moving forward with the deal. Tong said Chinese regulators typically do not step in to block Hong Kong business deals, but are within their rights to investigate. “If people carry on their business activities contrary to the law, they ought to be investigated to see whether they have fallen afoul of the law,” Tong told Al Jazeera. Experts quoted in the South China Morning Post said that Chinese regulators could claim legal jurisdiction over the deal by arguing that BlackRock’s acquisition of so many ports would give them a monopoly over regional trade routes. Proving that the deal would have an adverse impact on competition, however, could be more difficult, while invoking national security concerns could be challenging as BlackRock is a private company, the experts quoted by the Post said. Martina Fuchs, a business correspondent for the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, said she expects the deal to be delayed or called off as it has become “highly politicised.” “China’s criticism of CK Hutchison’s move to sell the ports business also reflects its strategic interests in the region on the one hand side, and the growing pressure from US President Donald Trump to curb China’s influence as well as worries about national security on the other,” Fuchs told Al Jazeera. “CK Hutchison being thrust into the crosshairs in the midst of the once-again escalating China-US trade war reflects how both powers are battling for control of the strategic waterway,” she said. What other pressure can Beijing apply? Even without going through formal legal channels, Beijing could apply pressure in other ways. CK Hutchison’s affiliate companies and business interests in the mainland are a point of vulnerability, according to an analyst who covers China’s economy, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of the issue. While CK Hutchison has wound down its investment in China, it still earns about 12 percent of its revenue from China – representing more than $300m in 2024. Its sister company, CK Asset Holdings, still owns dozens of properties in mainland China, which means it is also very exposed to Beijing, the analyst said. Foreign and local companies in Hong Kong will be closely watching to see what happens next, he said. “The wider Li family group of companies still has a meaningful amount of assets on the mainland, such as CK Asset’s property holdings. They are almost certainly aware that they could be exposed to retaliation from Beijing,” the analyst said. Kevin Yam, a lawyer who specialised in financial services and commercial litigation until he left Hong Kong in 2022, said Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma. After criticising China’s regulators in 2020, Ma was forced to cancel the IPO of Ant Financial, a financial subsidiary of Alibaba. Since then, he has only rarely been seen in public. “Hong Kong being Hong Kong, chances are they won’t cut the Li family down to size to the same extent as they did to Jack Ma, but I reckon ultimately whichever way this thing is going to go … it won’t be directly about the deal,” Yam, who is wanted by Hong Kong police over his participation in the 2019 protests, told Al Jazeera. Beijing has not shied away from using extrajudicial methods against prominent citizens in the past. In 2017, Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua – then one of China’s wealthiest people – vanished from the luxury hotel where he was living in Hong Kong, with multiple media outlets reporting that he had been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. Xiao’s exact whereabouts remained unknown for five years until 2022, when a Shanghai court sentenced the tycoon to 13 years imprisonment for allegedly embezzling $8bn. In 2023, Bao Fan, an influential Chinese tech banker, went incommunicado amid a crackdown on the financial services industry. Bao, whose firm announced his resignation last year, has not been publicly heard from since. What’s next for the CK Hutchison deal? With just a day to go until the April 2 deadline, the fate of the sale is unclear. While Chinese regulators are looking into the deal, the Hong Kong government has yet to investigate, according to Tong, who sits on the cabinet of Hong Kong’s chief executive. On the Chinese mainland, the government appears to be making use of both the carrot and the stick. Last week, Li’s son Richard was invited to the China Development Forum, a high-profile business summit held annually in Beijing. While Richard is not involved in the management of CK Hutchison, the markets interpreted his invitation as a positive sign for the company’s relations with Beijing, sending its shares 3.4 percent higher last Monday. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg reported that Beijing had issued a directive to state-owned enterprises to hold off on new business with CK Hutchison and its affiliates, citing people familiar with the matter. While it is still uncertain whether CK Hutchison and BlackRock will go ahead with the deal, a delay would not necessarily stop it in its tracks. The deal reportedly includes a 145-day exclusivity clause for negotiations, after which time CK Hutchison would be free to sell its assets to another party, according to the Post. The Post said neither party had revealed “the start or end” of the exclusivity period. Tong said it was difficult to say more without official word from CK Hutchison or BlackRock. “Very few facts are known to the public,” he said. “[CK Hutchison] is keeping mum, saying nothing at all, so people can only venture to guess what is happening.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: BlackRock, at centre of Panama ports deal, has nearly US$16 billion in Chinese stocks

SHANGHAI — BlackRock, the asset manager at the centre of a deal to buy US$23 billion in port assets from Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings, has about $15.5 billion invested in Hong Kong and mainland-listed stocks through its China-focused funds, with its portfolios concentrated on technology and financial companies. According to its website, the world's largest money manager has at least seven funds dedicated to Chinese stocks; five are passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and two are actively managed. The funds' top holdings as of the end of February included Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and China Merchants Bank, according to fact sheets. Alibaba owns the Post. The largest is the $7.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, which tracks the FTSE China 50 Index. The iShares MSCI China ETF, which tracks the MSCI China Index, ranked second with $6.3 billion in assets. The BlackRock China Fund is the larger of the two actively invested funds, with $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The BlackRock China A Opportunities Fund, which targets yuan-denominated stocks in mainland China, had $15.7 million in AUM. BlackRock also manages other funds with regional or global scopes that may also be invested in Chinese equities. Earlier in March, CK Hutchison said it would sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock for US$23 billion. The deal triggered a backlash and on Friday, Beijing said it would launch an antitrust probe into the sale. US President Donald Trump, who had lobbied for the canal to be freed from what he called Chinese control, hailed the deal, amid trade-based tensions between Beijing and Washington. The New York-based asset manager did not reply to an email from the Post seeking comment. A BlackRock building is seen in New York, the United States. (File photo: Reuters) At the end of 2023, BlackRock had AUM of US$10 trillion with US$5.3 trillion invested in stocks worldwide, according to its latest annual report. The firm's iShares China Large-Cap ETF is up 18% this year and its iShares MSCI China ETF has risen 16%. Both have benefited from a stock market rally triggered by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's release of two powerful but cost-effective large language models. The BlackRock China Fund, managed by Lucy Liu and Ada Zhang, has gained 14% so far this year. Tencent was the fund's top holding, accounting for 9.2% of its assets, followed by Alibaba at 8.5% and Xiaomi at 6.5%. The firm's China A Opportunities Fund has underperformed with a 3.2% rise this year, though it bested a 1.2% loss for the CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks over the same period. Its top three holdings were EV battery maker CATL, China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance. As of March 17, BlackRock funds held a combined 984.8 million shares of Alibaba, representing a 5.2% stake, according to data from Hong Kong's stock exchange. It also held 47.4 million Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE, a maker of telecoms equipment, representing a stake of 6.2%. BlackRock also recently held a 5.09% stake in CK Hutchison. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has said after his meetings with global financial leaders, investors were saying they would increase their exposure to Chinese stocks. And global investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised their targets for major China stock indices this year, citing appealing valuations and the positive impact on earnings from DeepSeek's breakthrough. For its part, BlackRock has said it was cautious about the outlook for Chinese stocks. "We are modestly overweight," the BlackRock Investment Institute said in its latest weekly commentary on March 24. "We think AI and tech excitement could keep driving returns, potentially reducing the odds of much-anticipated government stimulus. We stand ready to pivot. We remain cautious given structural challenges to China's growth and tariff risks."

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a "predictable” business environment, China’s market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing’s deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to "protect public interests.” Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing Li's CK Hutchison Holdings of acting "in concert with U.S. hegemony” over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the U.S. president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock as America "reclaiming” the famed waterway.

Title: Less than half of Irish workers feel ready for ‘comfortable retirement’, survey shows

Many families are still feeling the affects of the cost-of-living crisis.. Stock image A new survey has found that less than half of Irish workers believe that they can live a comfortable life after retirement. Financial advisers BlackRock surveyed 400 workers in Ireland, 300 of whom participate in Defined Contribution (DC) schemes – workplace plans where both employer and employee contribute a certain amount. “The 2025 survey highlights the importance of pensions in securing a comfortable retirement,” said Tim Hodgson, head of DC platforms and retirement solutions at BlackRock. “Retirement readiness remains a significant concern for many workers, with less than half (41pc) of survey participants feeling on-track for a reasonable standard of living in retirement. “This concern is particularly acute among those without DC workplace pensions, with only 26pc feeling prepared.” Next September, Irish workers who are not already enrolled in a pension plan will be automatically added to the My Future Fund or the auto-enrolment plan. Under the scheme, employees aged between 23 and 60 earning above €20,000 will be automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, unless they decide to opt out of it after six months. While participants showed interest in the scheme, the survey noted that there was a lack of understanding about the new pension plan and concerns about its affordability. In December, a report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) found that just one in 10 employees eligible for the auto-enrolment plan were aware of it. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment, it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” Mr Hodgson said. Out of the people surveyed who were not part of an existing pension plan, more than two-thirds said they would opt in to the scheme in year one but had concerns about affording it. The survey also noted generational differences in people’s attitude towards retirement. “Pre-retirees [people aged 60 to 69] and Gen X [those aged 45 to 60] ranked saving for retirement among their top-three financial priorities, whereas millennials [29-44] ranked it last in their financial priorities,” it said. “The introduction of auto enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement,” Mr Hodgson said.

March 31, 2025 19:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: In Annual Letter, BlackRock’s Larry Fink Omits Climate Change, DEI, And ESG

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan, Contributor. Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, ... More Switzerland, on Friday, Jan. 24, 2025. Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg On March 31, BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink released his annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors. After years of advocacy, in 2024, Fink began rolling back support of environmental, social, and governance as a priority. In 2025, ESG, sustainability, climate change, and DEI were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Managing over $11.6 trillion in assets, BlackRock Inc. is the world’s largest asset manager, giving them a large voice in international policy and reactions from businesses. Fink, BlackRock’s founder and CEO, was an early advocate for ESG and stakeholder capitalism, an approach to fiduciary duty that considers broader repercussions to the community and environment in making business decisions. However, conservatives took issue with climate policies and diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially as it relates to LGBTQ+ issues. As conservatives began pushing back on ESG in 2023, criticism of BlackRock and Fink quickly escalated. In response to the conservative backlash, Fink stated he will no longer be using the term ESG, as it had become too political. In the 2024 Chairman’s Letter to Investors, Fink avoided the phrase ESG, opting instead for the terms stakeholder capitalism, sustainable investing, or climate investing. However, none were mentioned in the 2025 letter, indicating a further separation from the issue. In the 2024 letter, Fink introduced a new term — energy pragmatism. Fink explained that there is a balance between “energy transition” to renewable energy as part of the global push to address climate change, and the need for “energy security” spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. By 2025, the the focus on energy shifted to the need for more development, specifically targeting the overly burdensome regulatory requirements and permit process. "In both the U.S. and the EU, it usually takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than to construct them. A high-voltage power line can take 13 years to get approved— something China does in a quarter of the time." “We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix.” Fink goes on to say, "Without massive investments in energy generation and transmission—and the electricians and engineers to build them—we’re going to face an unacceptable tradeoff: Who gets the electricity—people or machines? And a society that chooses to cool its servers while its citizens swelter—or freeze—has fundamentally misplaced its priorities. We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix. "Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can’t reliably keep the lights on. In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down. Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear." Fink’s focus on increased energy production and the adoption of new energy sources that may not align with the climate agenda is a notable shift to the right. This may be a result of his relationship with President Donald Trump or just a smart business move as the climate movement struggles globally. His criticism of overly burdensome regulations also aligns with recent actions by the European Union to simplify sustainability reporting requirements. The President of the European Commission is currently pushing a series of simplification measures, including the Omnibus Simplification Package, aimed at easing the regulatory burden on businesses in the EU. Whether Fink is driving the debate or simply reacting, the omissions in the annual letter are worth noticing.

Title: Fresh proof that Trump is right on Chinese control of the strategic Panama Canal

China’s efforts to stop the sale of a company that manages Panama Canal ports is proving President Trump dead right about the strategically vital waterway. Trump & Co. warn that Beijing’s pressure on Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which operates two of the ports, could wind up blocking US military and commercial shipping through the canal in the event of a US-China conflict. Such a national security threat puts the United States (and the West) in an untenable position, so the prez vowed to “take back” control of the canal. Hutchison then moved to sell its canal operations to a group led by US-based BlackRock — a win for Trump — in a deal that was to be signed Wednesday. But a Chinese state-owned Hong Kong news outlet on March 13 accused Hutchison of “betraying” the Chinese people. Last week, Chinese officials froze any new deals between state-owned firms and businesses tied to Hutchison’s primary owner, Li Ka-shing. Then Beijing last Friday scuttled the signing for now as it announced a government review of the deal. Bottom line: China’s rulers look determined to retain control of the strategically critical maritime conduit — whether to threaten US access to the key shipping lane or to ensure it will remain open to Chinese vessels no matter what. Beijing might stand down when it realizes its heavy hand in Hong Kong’s commercial market will frighten more firms out of doing business there — yet another step toward killing the golden goose of what had been a global financial center. China’s leaders and their fourth-rate Hong Kong minions have already gone a long way down that road, with crushing of democratic dissent, the closing of Hong Kong’s popular Apple Daily (a publicly traded company) and the clumsy kangaroo-court prosecutions of its chief, Jimmy Lai, and several of its employees — all proving that what once made the city a great place to do business, the rule of law, is a dead letter. If Beijing does try to permanently block the Hutchison sale, it’ll definitely speed the business flight from Hong Kong — and may still lose the canal ports, since Panama’s government could force the issue. Meanwhile, it’s already proved Team Trump’s point: If China cares so much about who controls the canal, so should we.

Title: YouTube’s Revenue Will Top Disney’s This Year As It Becomes “The Home For All Things Video”, Analyst Says

By Dade Hayes Business Editor YouTube‘s revenue will surpass Disney‘s this year, making it the top global player in media, according to a report by veteran Wall Street analyst Michael Nathanson. With $54.2 billion in revenue last year, the company is on pace to become No. 1 by the end of 2025, he predicts in a new report issued Monday. Because of its massive viewing, which has twice eclipsed that for Disney and other media giants according to Nielsen, the valuation for the former black sheep has continued moving skyward. “If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $475 to $550 billion, or about 30% of Alphabet’s current valuation,” wrote Nathanson, a partner in MoffettNathanson, in his annual report on YouTube, which anoints the company “king of all media.” (The value of Netflix and Meta Platforms, for comparison, are in a similar neighborhood.) Related Stories News 'Doctor Who' Star Says "Doctor Woke" Criticism Means Series Is Simply Spreading Kindness News 'Snow White', Poisoned By Controversy At Box Office, Won't Have A Happy Ending With $115M Loss: What Went Wrong Despite his rhapsody about YouTube’s scale, growth and potential, Nathanson in the report actually lowered his 12-month price target on parent Alphabet’s shares by $10, putting it at $210. He reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on the stock, however. Nathanson believes YouTube is just coming into its own as a seller of advertising in the living room. While the company has long touted growth of viewing of its content via a TV screen, confirming last month that it now has surpassed mobile, the ad marketplace is still catching up. Entrenched streaming ad purveyor Pluto is able to charge about 26 cents per hour of viewing, while YouTube is at about 18 cents, Nathanson estimates. “Given YouTube’s scaled reach and data advantage over other AVOD/FAST platforms, we believe YouTube is under-monetizing its engagement today and instead should be in a league of its own ahead of this comp group,” ahead of Tubi, Roku Channel and Pluto, the analyst writes. In addition to ad revenue upside, Nathanson continues, “YouTube is also positioned to become the home for all things video.” That projection is based on the company’s dominance across “three key buckets.” The report defines them as YouTube Premium & Music; YouTube TV, where the company recently surpassed 8 million subscribers, and “Other.” That last bucket includes YouTube Primetime Channels (including NFL Sunday Ticket), channel memberships, VOD, and creator monetization tools throwing off a share of proceeds to YouTube.

Title: Why Index Funds Are Out, And These 3 Big Dividends Are In

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. Investment asset allocation and rebalance concept. In our Thursday article, we talked about a “quiet shift” in the markets, from growth stocks to value—and we named 2 CEFs yielding 9%+ that are primed to profit from it. Yes, the recent jump in volatility is a big reason for that. So today, we’re going to look at another side of the rotation we’re seeing—a shift from passive investing to active. As we move further into 2025, it’s getting clearer to me that we’re into a stock-picker’s market. Sitting in an index fund just won’t cut it. That said, at my CEF Insider service, we’re still bullish on stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds, many of which hand us 8%+ yields), and we’ll get into two stock-focused funds, along with another that holds preferred stocks—kind of a stock/bond hybrid—below. Because there’s no question that success in this market will require active management—moving into, and out of, the right stocks and sectors at the right times. Of course, many mainstream investors aren’t interested in that—it’s too much work. Which is why I’m betting that many of them are likely to give CEFs a closer look as we move further into 2025. As they do, they’ll discover what we’ve known at CEF Insider for years: CEFs let you sit back and collect high yields (and price upside) while “farming out” picking the actual investments to a professional human manager. That makes now a great time to pick up some well-run CEFs as active management (finally) regains appeal. Doing so lets us buy our CEFs at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), especially in the wake of the recent selloff. Then, as more investors pile in, we get to ride along as those discounts shrink, pulling our CEFs’ market prices higher as they do. Which brings me back to those three CEFs I mentioned off the top—the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG)—a CEF Insider holding—the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW) and the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Securities Fund (FFC). All are trading at discounts and boast dividends that are either sky-high (9.4% in the case of ASG) or set to grow (like STEW’s 4%-yielding payout). ASG is a multi-manager fund that invests in large-, mid- and small-cap growth stocks. This means it leverages the knowledge of experts in different sectors (tech, financial, etc.), as well as experts with experience investing in big companies, small companies and everything in between. ASG is interesting now because, in a sense, it gives us two discounts. The first is the fund’s discount to NAV, which is 7.9% as I write this, even though the fund has delivered an 8.4% annualized total return over the last decade, based on its market price, as of this writing. That 7.9% discount is well below its five-year average of 1%, which is our first discount here. The other one is on the fund’s stocks themselves, and we can see the recent dip in those by looking at its NAV performance, including dividends. That’s entirely the result of the last few weeks of volatility: ASG Total Returns Meantime, ASG offers a rich 9.4% dividend yield. Unlike ETFs, which typically provide minimal yield, ASG’s managed-distribution policy (meaning ASG management can raise or lower payouts depending on what’s best for the fund’s long-term returns. Moreover, ASG’s overall yield is actually higher than it looks, since management regularly pays special dividends. ASG Dividend With a discount to NAV and a dip in its portfolio performance, ASG is set up to gain as more investors “farm out” their stock picking. Buy it now and we could collect that 9.4% “base” payout in the meantime. Next up is the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), which sports one of the biggest discounts in CEFs, at 23.1%. That’s wild when you consider that STEW delivered a tidy 12.7% annualized return over the last decade. Moreover, that 23.1% discount is nearly five percentage points wider than STEW’s long-term average of 18.2%. STEW Discount STEW’s top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which comprises nearly 40% of the portfolio between the two share classes, as well as other well-known large caps, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and pipeline master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). So, why is this fund trading at such a deep discount? Simply put: neglect. STEW doesn’t have the same name recognition as some larger CEFs. But with markets now rewarding active strategies and investors looking to large caps during this volatility, that’s set to change. STEW is also valuable because management can put 40% of their portfolio in stocks like BRK when they’re undervalued, while SEC rules limit passive funds to stick to no more than about 10% of their assets in any one holding. Once investors pick up on STEW’s strong performance and deep discount, the gap should narrow. And with a very well-covered dividend, you’re very likely to see higher payouts over time, building on the 4% yield you’d get on a buy made today. In fact, history strongly suggests that’s exactly what’ll happen here: STEW Dividend Just in the past five years, STEW’s payout has jumped 62%, and as you can see at the right of this chart, its payout growth is accelerating. That bodes well for anyone buying this bargain-priced CEF today. The Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities Income Fund (FFC) holds preferred shares, which trade on an exchange, like stocks, and represent ownership in a company. But their price movements are more like those of bonds. And, like bonds, they’re sensitive to interest rates. More on that in a second. Banks and insurance companies are the main issuers of preferreds, which is why 54% of FFC’s portfolio consists of financial services firms, with preferreds from the likes of Wells Fargo and MetLife. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re considering how FFC fits into your overall portfolio weighting. Beyond that, the fund is a good way to pick up a basket of preferreds and lock in a 6.8% yield while doing so. FFC Dividend Above you can see the rate sensitivity of FFC’s dividend in action, with the payout moving lower as rates rose in 2022 and 2023, then steadying and rising as rates topped out and began to move lower (along with a special dividend late last year). Here’s what makes FFC particularly interesting now: It historically trades at a premium to NAV of 1%, but it’s currently at a 5.8% discount. That’s a big break from its norm, and it’s unlikely to last. Preferred securities tend to do well when rates are stabilizing, and that’s where we are now, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell saying he’s content to hold off on further cuts until the effects of Trump administration policies (especially around tariffs) become clearer. Even so, the latest projections from the Federal Open Market Committee do still indicate that two rate cuts are expected in 2025, probably toward the end of the year. When that happens, preferreds will benefit, and funds like FFC are likely to see renewed interest—which I see pushing the fund’s discount back toward a premium. That leaves us with FFC’s 6.8% dividend (with potential for more payout growth) to collect while we wait. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Goldman Sachs Flags 35% Recession Risk — What This Means For Crypto

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets edged lower Monday following a stark warning from Goldman Sachs, which raised its 12-month US recession probability to 35%, citing rising tariffs, weakening growth, and deteriorating sentiment. The reassessment follows the firm’s second upward revision in March to its 2025 US tariff expectations, signaling an increasingly fraught macroeconomic environment with direct implications for risk assets — including cryptocurrencies. In the note titled “US Economics Analyst: A Further Increase in Our Tariff Assumptions”, Goldman economists Alec Phillips, Tim Walker, and David Mericle outline their rationale: “We now expect the average US tariff rate to rise 15pp in 2025 […] almost the entire revision reflects a more aggressive assumption for ‘reciprocal’ tariffs.” Goldman anticipates that President Trump will announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2. Adjusted for product and country exclusions, the effective rise in average tariffs is expected to be around 9 percentage points. The impact on the macro outlook is stark: Goldman has downgraded its 2025 US GDP growth forecast by 0.5pp to 1.0% (Q4/Q4), lifted its year end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5% (+0.5pp), and increased its unemployment projection to 4.5% (+0.3pp). These revisions reflect a stagnating growth environment paired with inflationary pressures — a combination that constrains monetary stimulus options. The bank attributes the rise in recession probability to three key factors: a lower growth baseline; deteriorating household and business confidence; and “statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.” Despite historically poor predictive power from sentiment measures, Goldman writes: “We are less dismissive of the recent decline because economic fundamentals are not as strong as in prior years. Most importantly, real income growth has already slowed sharply and we expect it to average only 1.4% this year.” While digital assets have long been viewed as uncorrelated to traditional macroeconomic variables, that narrative has evolved. Bitcoin, in particular, has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions — particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields. As the yield curve inverts once again — a classic recession signal — macro analysts are warning of a unique policy dilemma. As @ecoinometrics noted on X: “The yield curve is inverting again, a traditional recession signal. But unlike past cycles, the Fed is unlikely to rush to QE due to inflation concerns. This creates a double challenge for Bitcoin: potential risk-off pressure without the stimulus relief that typically follows. Bitcoin is very much driven by macro these days. It is behaving like a high-beta play on the NASDAQ 100.” However, not everyone agrees that a recession poses a net-negative risk for crypto. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, offered a nuanced view of Bitcoin’s macro sensitivity: “Economic fears. I mean, I don’t know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin […] It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession. It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus. That tends to happen in a recession.” Mitchnick acknowledges the short-term constraints — the wealth effect, reduced disposable income, and high correlations with equities — but maintains that structurally, Bitcoin benefits from the long-term consequences of recessionary policy responses. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system… and to some extent over just fears of general social disorder […] that too, unfortunately, is something that can come up in a recession.” He adds that current market reactions may not reflect Bitcoin’s true positioning: “The market has almost, it seems, gotten this in some ways not particularly well calibrated… but that’s where the opportunity comes in for education in a market and an asset class that’s still very nascent.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,230.

Title: Stocks close out their worst quarter since 2022 amid tariff uncertainty

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate. The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023. The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months. The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022. The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year. The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price. The first quarter of this year saw geopolitical upheaval of a different sort, as investors have struggled to digest the series of major U.S. policy changes since Inauguration Day. The quarter marked the S&P’s worst performance versus the rest of the world since 1980, according to Dow Jones — at a time when a number of foreign stock markets have surged. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks companies across 17 countries, has risen 5% to start the year as the S&P 500 dropped by roughly the same amount. In fact, the Stoxx 600 has just had its best quarter against the S&P since 2015, according to FactSet data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 also rose more than 5% in the same period. The MSCI China index, a benchmark of 580 Chinese stocks, ended the first quarter up 16%. Markets overseas have popped for a range of reasons, with some but not all related to the Trump administration’s actions. The European Union and U.K. have taken steps to trim regulations and hike military spending in response to White House moves, boosting shares of defense companies in both places and helping power markets there overall. In China, the strong performance has been more a reflection of local factors, including economic stimulus and enthusiasm around home-grown AI startups. It’s not a rosy picture everywhere, though. Japan’s flagship stock index sank 10% in the first quarter over fears about slowing manufacturing and an export economy that could be hurt by Trump’s still-expanding tariff agenda. The president is set to open another front in his trade war Wednesday, a date he has dubbed America’s “Liberation Day” from the purported abuses of its top trading partners, many of them longtime allies. Trump has vowed so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade barriers between the U.S. and a number of countries that sell to Americans more of their own goods and services than those they buy from the U.S. But with the details of this policy program still up in the air days before it’s set to roll out, business leaders and consumers have been grappling with widespread uncertainty over the coming impact. Nearly 900 nonfinancial companies mentioned tariffs on recent earnings calls, S&P Global Market Intelligence said this month. “This is truly ridiculous,” one manufacturing executive said in an anonymous Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey published Monday. “I have been in business for 50 years as of next year, and never have I seen such uncertainty in the market. It is very difficult to plan and make decisions.” But things could still turn around in the months ahead, some analysts say. “Once tariffs are announced on April 2, negotiations to soften them can begin,” researchers at the investment bank UBS said in a note to clients Monday. “Progress toward a budget reconciliation bill could refocus attention on market-positive aspects of the Trump agenda.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?

Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:29:00Z

New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH+3.16%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT+0.44%) and Meta (META+0.80%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?

New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH+3.16%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT+0.44%) and Meta (META+0.80%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029.

Title: Dividend Investing For Beginners In 4 Simple Steps
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinebrock/2025/03/31/dividend-investing-for-beginners-in-4-simple-steps/
Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:28:04Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. Dividend investing does not have to be intimidating or complicated. It only takes some quick learning and a few easy steps to start building your passive dividend income stream. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. The fun happens when dividend payments hit your account every quarter or month. The financial rewards—which are ongoing—include two forms of returns, rising income and low volatility. Dividend-paying securities provide cash income plus appreciation potential. Together, earned dividends and price gains comprise your total return. Total return is an important metric for comparing dividend-payers to securities that don’t pay dividends. Dividend-paying securities often produce lower total returns than growth stocks. This makes sense because their risk is lower. With a dividend payer, the income is yours once it lands in your account. It cannot be rescinded, and you can use the cash to reinvest. Many growth securities do not pay dividends. They only provide appreciation gains which you earn when their price rises. Those gains are not permanent and can change quickly if the stock price falls. Some dividend securities provide ongoing income that rises over time. Rising income is a valuable offset to inflation, particularly in retirement—when you don’t have the opportunity to get a raise at work. Dividend stocks are categorized by how many consecutive years they have raised their shareholder payouts: These companies can cancel or reduce their dividend at any point, so their current status does not guarantee future income. Therefore, diversification is important. When your income portfolio is diversified, you are less dependent on one company’s dividend policy. Not every company can pay dividends consistently for decades. This achievement requires: These same qualities encourage low stock-price volatility and relatively consistent earnings. This is why some of the best dividend-paying stocks are blue-chip companies. Blue-chip describes large, financially strong companies with recognizable brand names such as Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM) and Walmart (WMT). Even if you’ve never invested before, you can start dividend investing in four simple steps. You’ll choose an account, pick your asset type, invest and automate. Earned dividends are taxable, even if you reinvest them. Many domestic stocks pay qualified dividends, which are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Nonqualified dividends are taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate. You can defer the annual federal tax obligation by holding your dividend payers in a tax-advantaged account. 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs and 529 plans provide tax deferrals on investment earnings. Tax-advantaged accounts have withdrawal restrictions, which can be good or bad depending on your goals. If you are investing to build retirement income, then it makes sense to hold dividend securities in an IRA or 401(k). If you prefer to access the income sooner than retirement, a regular brokerage account or direct investment with the company will do. In this case, remember to plan for a higher tax bill each year. Next, you will pick which types of security you prefer. This may be an easy choice if you invest in a 401(k) with limited investment options. In accounts with broad access to publicly traded securities, you can choose from individual stocks, REITs and funds. Stocks Stocks are ownership shares of publicly traded companies. The dividend payments represent your share of profits. REITs REIT stands for real estate investment trust. These entities own and manage real estate. Special tax treatment requires REITs to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Funds Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) are investment portfolios that sell shares. As a fund shareholder, you earn when the portfolio produces income or increases in value. Many funds focus on dividend-paying securities to provide income for their shareholders. Examples include Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV). There are also REIT funds, such as iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR). Next, you will research your options and place your first trade order. You can prepare for this step by deciding whether to prioritize dividend yield or income consistency. Dividend yield measures income efficiency. It is calculated as the annual dividend payment divided by the share price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a blue-chip index, pays an average dividend yield of 1.82%. Some stocks and REITs pay much higher yields, but the payments may vary over time. If you are not yet comfortable analyzing a stock or REIT's yield, dividend track record and financial health, opt for a fund with a low expense ratio and 100 or more securities in its portfolio. Consistent, recurring investments help you grow your dividend portfolio and income potential faster. Consider setting a monthly investing budget and automating those trades in your investment account. You can also reinvest your dividend payments automatically. This allows you to raise your income potential through compounding, which happens when your investment earnings generate more earnings. Many brokerage accounts allow for automatic dividend reinvestment. If yours doesn't, look for stocks or funds that offer direct investment and free dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP). Direct stock purchase plans are managed through the company rather than a broker. They may have lower fees than brokerage accounts, but the shares can be harder to sell. Computershare is a good resource for researching DRIPs. With the right investments, your dividend program can be low-maintenance and self-propelling. Opt for stocks or REITs with long and consistent dividend track records and low-fee funds emphasizing dividend reliability. Invest often, reinvest your dividends and watch your income potential grow over time.

Title: Larry Fink Calls for ‘Democratization of Investing’

Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:12:27Z

Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock Inc., wants to expand investor access to alternative investments and warned that too few Americans are saving for retirement in his annual chairman’s letter. Fink writes that the assets that will “define the future”—including data centers, ports, power grids and the fastest-growing private companies—are out of reach for most investors, only accessible by institutions and high-net-worth individuals. “The reason for the exclusivity has always been risk. Illiquidity. Complexity. That’s why only certain investors are allowed in,” Fink wrote. “But nothing in finance is immutable. Private markets don’t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate.” Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Fink highlighted BlackRock’s recent acquisitions of private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, infrastructure manager Global Infrastructure Partners and alternatives data firm Preqin, pushing the firm beyond being a traditional asset manager. “BlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we’ve been—first and foremost—a traditional asset manager,” Fink wrote. “That’s who we were at the start of 2024. But it’s not who we are anymore.” The 50/30/20 Portfolio and Infrastructure Fink’s letter suggested the standard portfolio of the future will include allocations to stocks, bonds and private assets, the latter acting as a diversifier, with infrastructure playing an important role. He described a new standard allocation of 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% alternatives. The traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio may well be a thing of the past. “Generations of investors have done well following this approach, owning a mix of the entire market rather than individual securities,” Fink wrote. “But as the global financial system continues to evolve, the classic 60/40 portfolio may no longer fully represent true diversification.” Fink noted three benefits of including infrastructure in a portfolio; inflation protection, volatility protection and strong historical returns. According to BlackRock, adding infrastructure to both a 60/40 portfolio and a pension portfolio increases returns and decreases portfolio volatility. Also according to BlackRock, $68 trillion in infrastructure investment will be needed between 2024 and 2040, which Fink described as the equivalent of building the U.S. interstate highway system and its transcontinental railroad every six weeks for 15 years. But for infrastructure investments to make sense for individuals and for retirement accounts, Fink called for the deregulation of infrastructure permitting. “We can’t democratize investing if it takes 13 years to build a power line,” Fink wrote, noting that it typically takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than it takes to build them. “Giving retirement investors access to infrastructure matters less if the infrastructure never gets built. That’s often the case today.” Investing for Retirement According to a January BlackRock survey, 33% of Americans have no retirement savings, 51% are more worried about outliving their savings than about dying, and one-third of Americans would have a hard time paying an unexpected $500 bill. One way to fix the “retirement gap” is to increase access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, according to Fink. “We’re going to need better ways to boost portfolios,” Fink wrote. “As I wrote earlier, private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns. Pension funds have invested in these assets for decades, but 401(k)s haven’t. It’s one reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year.” According to BlackRock, that additional 0.5% every year, when compounded over 40 years, will result in 14.5% more money in a 401(k) plan by the time of retirement. “Or, put another way, private assets just bought you nine extra years hanging out with your grandkids,” Fink wrote. Still, there is a long way to go before alternative investments become ubiquitous in employer-sponsored defined contributions plans. While the number of plan sponsors implementing alternative strategies in their plans has increased, sponsors are often faced with lawsuits by plan participants alleging that such investments are violating the plans’ fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The illiquidity of these assets is another issue. “When you invest in private assets—like a bridge, for example—the values of those assets aren’t updated daily, and you can’t withdraw your money whenever you want,” Fink wrote. “It’s a bridge, after all—not a stock.” But Fink is confident that alts will play a role in the retirement accounts of the future. “Asset managers, private-market specialists, consultants, and advisers all play a role in guiding 401(k) providers. That’s part of the reason I’m writing this letter—to cut through the fog,” Fink wrote. “We need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They’re beneficial. And they’re becoming increasingly transparent.” Another important financial wellness tool for American, Fink wrote, is expanding emergency savings. “No one invests for retirement if they’re worried about paying for a flat tire or ER visit tomorrow,” Fink wrote. He called the emergency savings provision of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 “just a start” and suggested, “We can simplify the rules further, raise contribution limits, and enable automatic enrollment in standalone emergency accounts.” Related Stories: BlackRock More Than Doubles Private Credit Business With HPS Investment Partners Acquisition BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter Tags: Alternative Investments, BlackRock, Larry Fink, Retirement « Temasek Asset Management Unit Seviora Opens Shop in Abu Dhabi

Title: Nvidia To Invest Billions In U.S. Supply Chain As Tech Companies Commit To Trump's Onshoring Pledge

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Leading artificial intelligence chip maker Nvidia NVDA plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. supply chain over the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that the increased U.S. production was being made possible thanks to suppliers such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM and Foxconn FXCOF. “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total,” Huang told the FT. “And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.” Don't Miss: Huang, speaking on March 18 during his company’s GTC convention, believed the Trump administration’s “America First” policy would enable his company to ramp up chip production in the U.S. “Having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,” he told the FT. Huang’s sentiments follow pledges by other tech companies to onshore manufacturing in the U.S. rather than overseas. Apple has committed to spending $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, expanding teams and facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. Trending: Invest in the Future of Digital Engagement. Own a Piece of the $100 Billion Metaverse Today for Just $500. TSMC has already committed a $100 billion investment in a chip fabrication plant in Arizona, which President Donald Trump has said would create thousands of jobs bringing Taiwan Semiconductor’s investment to "about $165 billion." “TSMC investing in the U.S. provides for a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience,” Huang told the FT. TSMC’s Taiwan-based production facilities have been an increasingly pivotal part of Nvidia and Apple’s manufacturing process, which Trump was once keen to change, previously threatening to impose tariffs on Taiwan. By pledging to build new facilities in the U.S., Trump said that Taiwan avoided a 25% tariff. “TSMC already has plants in the US and Japan, and it’s now building a new plant in Germany,” Taiwanese presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo told the Guardian. “These have nothing to do with tariffs. TSMC’s global expansion is a crucial development.” See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. Trump has been basking in a wave of tech commitments to manufacture products in the U.S. “GE Aerospace GE announced on Tuesday a nearly $1 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, the latest company to do so under the Trump administration… It marks the latest company to put money back into the U.S. economy,” Trump said. Other tech companies or those that finance them have also announced big U.S.-based investments. Meta META has announced a $65 billion investment, most of which will be used to construct new data centers to fuel its AI operations. This follows investments from Google, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN in data centers as the AI arms race heats up. Trump has announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle ORCL called Stargate, which aims to invest at least $100 billion in U.S. data centers. Many of these data centers will house the incredibly powerful GPU computers powering the AI revolution. Nvidia currently has between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market used in GPUs.

Title: Truth Social owner Trump Media becomes first company listed on NYSE Texas — handing early win to exchange

Trump Media & Technology Group said on Monday it has become the first company to be listed on NYSE Texas, handing an early boost to the exchange as it gears up for fierce competition in the Lone Star state. The company, which operates Truth Social and is primarily owned by President Trump, said it will also list its warrants on the Texas exchange. Its primary listing, however, will remain on the Nasdaq. The move could bolster Intercontinental Exchange-owned NYSE, which on Monday became the first exchange to operate in Texas. The state is home to the largest number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with a combined market value of over $3.7 trillion, and is now seeing rising competition for market dominance among stock exchanges. NYSE will have to contend with rival Nasdaq, which promised to open a regional headquarters in the state earlier this month, and the Texas Stock Exchange, a venture backed by heavyweights including BlackRock and Citadel Securities. The Texas Stock Exchange submitted paperwork in January to operate as a national securities exchange, and is eyeing a launch in 2026. “This listing, alongside our plans to reincorporate in Florida, shows we’re part of a growing movement to take our business to states that value free enterprise and personal freedom,” said Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes. Trump Media is a popular stock on retail trading forums and has often seen wild bouts of volatility in the past, such as around the election in November. Securing the listing is a major win for the NYSE, but some consider the move “symbolic” – a perception that the exchange will likely need to change, while also strengthening liquidity. Still, the growing competition between listing venues could strengthen the state’s emergence as a financial hub and a challenger to New York. “The Texas business-friendly environment — lack of all the political issues and a stronger focus on what business should be — has a really unique position,” said Derek Wilson, co-founder of Dallas Opportunity Partners, an investor in the Texas Stock Exchange. The announcement came on the heels of a filing late on Friday that BlackRock’s iShares division has filed for SEC approval to launch a Texas-focused exchange traded fund. The asset management giant did not disclose the exchange on which it proposes to list the ETF. The fund will invest in stocks of companies headquartered in Texas that make up the Russell Texas Equity Index, a subset of the Russell 3000 index Unless regulators block or delay the offering, it could begin trading by early June.

ByWilliam Roberson ByWilliam Roberson Contributor. LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 07: Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the ... More Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 07, 2024 in Laguna Beach, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) Recently, when Rivian electric car company founder Robert “RJ” Scaringe introduced the R2S SUV and R2T pickup truck, he paid homage to Apple founder Steve Jobs’ iconic “one more thing” end-of-presentation-surprise strategy. Scaringe introduced not one unexpected vehicle—the R3—but also a second variant, the R3X, which has the automotive segment excited even though the new models are still a year or so from production. Watch the wink to Jobs at the 27:45 mark: Now, Scaringe and Rivian have announced another unexpected thing: a micromobility development company called Also, Inc. The products from Also will skew more toward personal use, although some micromobility products—especially e-bikes—are quickly becoming staples of the delivery industry, with workers contracting with companies such as Uber Eats, Doordash and others. Rivian has also produced tens of thousands of distinctive electric delivery vans for Amazon.com and recently began offering the vans for public sale. “Also will focus on small, lightweight vehicles that are designed to meet the global mobility transportation challenges of today and tomorrow,” Rivian said in a press release, with Scaringe adding “for the world to fully transition to electrified transportation, a range of vehicle types and form factors will be needed.” Also will be its own company, but will work closely with Rivian, much like Harley-Davidson and its e-moto spinoff LiveWire and Royal Enfield with its new electric motorcycle company Flying Flea (below). Chris Yu, Rivian’s VP of future programs, will be president of Also, according to Rivian’s press release. Additional funding for Also totaling over $100 million will come from investment company Eclipse, which is currently working with dozens of small tech startups. Other partners, so far unnamed, are reportedly involved. No specific products or timelines have been announced as of yet, but Scaringe has a history of paying attention to the mobility market, even while developing his full-size vehicles. According to tech tracking site TechCrunch, Scaringe will show an initial vehicle later this year, and strongly hinted it will be an affordable e-bike. TechCrunch said Scaringe and Rivian growth director and Eclipse partner Jiten Behl started talking about developing micromobility products just ahead of the pandemic. During the Covid years, TechCrunch said Christ Yu from bicycle and e-bike maker Specialized joined the effort. Bloomberg posted in early 2023 that Rivian was working on an e-bike, but details were scant. Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, one year after Tesla began production of its first model, the original Lotus-based Roadster. Rivian went public in late 2021 with a stock price near $130 per share, giving the company a massive market cap before they had produced many commercial vehicles. The first Rivian R1T electric pickup for commercial sale rolled off the assembly line in September of that year. The stock fell as the pandemic wore on and excitement over EVs waned. Rivian CEO Robert "RJ" Scaringe speaks at the unveiling of the Rivian R3X (R) and R3 electric ... More vehicles at the Rivian South Coast Theater in Laguna Beach, California, on March 7, 2024. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Today, Rivian shares remain in the teens and production continues for the company’s latest generation of R1S and R1T vehicles as well as the distinctive electric delivery vans. Rivian’s market cap has hovered around $10 to $20 billion since 2022, and the company turned its first official profit—$170 million—in the last quarter of 2024 after years of heavy losses as production scaled up. With many prospective EV buyers souring on Tesla vehicles due to CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement, Rivian’s profile has risen as of late. With President Trump’s fairly antagonistic relationship with (most) electric vehicles and a possible end of tax incentives of EV buyers, the move to release Also into the wild might be timely if the vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and not affected by tariffs. The vast majority of e-bikes, electric scooters and other micromobility products are manufactured in China, putting them at risk of price increases due to tariffs. Scaringe told TechCrunch he thinks many e-bikes are overpriced; a competitive domestic product with no tariff charges could have legs (or wheels) if production can scale quickly and import tariffs remain in place.

Title: BlackRock CEO warns US dollar could lose global reserve status to Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-03-31T18:33:39Z

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink issued a stark warning in his 2025 annual letter to investors, saying that the United States risks losing its global reserve currency status to Bitcoin. “If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if the deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote in his 2025 annual letter to investors. His comments come as BlackRock’s own actions echo this conviction. Since launching its spot Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has accumulated over 575,000 BTC, cementing its position as both the largest asset manager and the largest holder of Bitcoin in the ETF space. Fink’s remarks and the firm’s Bitcoin strategy signal that BlackRock views Bitcoin as the dominant digital asset class poised to lead the financial future. Although he emphasized his support for digital innovation, he warned that the same technology could erode America’s edge if investors begin viewing Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the dollar. Recent developments have underscored the urgency of Fink’s warning. Earlier this month, Moody’s downgraded its outlook on US debt to negative, citing rising concerns over former President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs and unfunded tax cuts. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Policy Center has projected that the US could default on its obligations as early as July if Congress fails to intervene. Fink’s warning on US debt came alongside an optimistic outlook on innovation. He described tokenization as one of the most transformative shifts in modern finance. Arguing that converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens would revolutionize investing by enabling instant settlement, democratized access, and better yields. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” he wrote. “If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” The key challenge, he said, is identity verification, which remains a technical and regulatory bottleneck for tokenized markets. Fink cited India’s Aadhaar system as a potential model for the digital financial infrastructure needed to scale such solutions globally. Despite the anxiety voiced by clients and leaders worldwide, Fink expressed long-term optimism in capital markets, calling them one of the most powerful human systems ever created. Yet even that system, he warned, may not be enough to preserve US dominance if Washington fails to get its fiscal house in order. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that the US dollar may be losing its reserve status to Bitcoin (BTC). In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened – not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” BlackRock heavily invested in Bitcoin in 2024 with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which would ultimately become the most successful exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch of all time. Fink, who oversees $11.5 trillion in assets at BlackRock, notes how the world’s financial system runs on “plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,” opening the door for smoother, faster technology like blockchain-based tokenization. The CEO says, “If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself.” “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Blackdog1966/Andy Chipus Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are tackling heart health next

After revolutionizing the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.10%) and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.67%) are setting their sights on heart health. Both pharma giants unveiled new clinical trial results over the weekend, highlighting potential cardiovascular benefits of their medications. Novo Nordisk shared fresh data on semaglutide — the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. One study found that a weekly 2.4 mg dose led to a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events — such as heart attack, stroke, or death — among overweight or obese patients with existing cardiovascular disease, compared with a control group. Another study examined its daily semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, which showed a 14% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and some combination of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, compared with a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s chief rival, Eli Lilly, also released new heart health data. It said its experimental drug lepodisiran lowered levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) — a particle linked to cardiovascular disease — by 94% with a single injection. About 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which can double the risk of a heart attack and is linked with conditions like stroke and aortic valve stenosis. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into fewer heart attacks and strokes and large-scale clinical trials are underway to answer that question. These latest findings build on previous efforts by both companies to explore their medications’ effects on heart health. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” Martin Holst Lange, the company’s executive vice president for development, said in a press release. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded Wegovy’s approved use after Novo Nordisk announced that the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20% in a clinical trial. Meanwhile, in August, Lilly said that tirzepatide — the active ingredient in its weight-loss drug Zepbound — helped reduce heart failure risks in obese patients. Patients who took tirzepatide were 38% less likely to be hospitalized, require increased heart failure medication, or die from heart failure compared than those who received a placebo. Novo Nordisk’s shares gained 0.9% in U.S. trading on Monday, while Eli Lilly’s stock declined about 1%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

March 31, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Tech stocks tank, S&P 500 slips as Wall Street braces for Trump tariffs

Stocks took a roller coaster ride Monday as surprisingly hawkish signals from President Trump on tariffs rattled Wall Street. Trump on Sunday signaled he plans to impose wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs affecting all US trading partners worldwide — contradicting a more selective approach that was signaled by White House officials last week. “You’d start with all countries,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday — though he added that the tariffs would be more generous than trade partners had been to the US. Earlier in the day, Trump had said he “couldn’t care less” if foreign automakers raised prices because of a planned 25% import levy. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite recorded the day’s most significant losses, declining more than 2% and reaching its lowest point in half a year before recovering to end the session off just 0.1%. “The uncertainty over the tariff policy is more of a problem for markets than the tariffs themselves,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Manhattan-based Bahnsen Group, which boasts $7.1 billion in assets, told The Post. “Stocks are moving lower on the uncertainty over tariffs, and the realization that the April 2 ‘Liberation Day’ may not provide more clarity.” At the start of trading, the broader S&P 500 index lost more than 1% — falling 60 points to hit its lowest level since September — while the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a more modest decline of about 0.4%. Later in the day, however, the Dow was in positive territory, gaining more than 400 points at the session’s close. The S&P also rebounded — ending the session 0.6% higher. The rebound was likely the result of buyers taking advantage of dips and hedging that Wednesday’s “Liberation Day” for imposing US tariffs might not be as bad as investors thought, said Ken Mahoney, chief executive of Mahoney Asset Management. “It is still tentative, and we know one day doesn’t make a market,” Mahoney told The Post. “The gap down this morning, though, after Friday’s rout, was a gift, and gave bargain hunters some good opportunities.” The prospect of an all-out trade war as well as declining consumer and business confidence prompted Goldman Sachs on Monday to raise its 12-month recession odds to 35%, up from 20%. The firm also raised its inflation outlook and projects three interest rate cuts in 2025. Goldman trimmed its 2025 GDP growth estimate to 1% and revised its year-end unemployment forecast to 4.5%. It also lifted its year-end inflation forecast to 3.5%, based on annual gains in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a metric the Fed closely watches. Other Wall Street analysts are issuing similar warnings. Earlier this month, economists at JPMorgan assigned a 40% chance of a recession. Leading technology companies were especially hard hit on Monday. Shares of Nvidia, the maker of chips used to power artificial intelligence, tumbled more than 5% during the early session before closing down 1.2%. while Tesla, whose stock hit record highs of more than $430 per share following the Nov. 5 election, saw declines exceeding 5% before ending the day down 1.7%.

Amid rising volatility and uncertainty in equities, investors sought refuge in safer assets like gold. Consequently, gold prices surged past the significant $3,100-per-ounce threshold for the first time, trading around $3,147, driven by heightened demand for risk-off investments. The previous week marked the fifth decline in the past six weeks for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Markets remain vigilant, closely scrutinizing economic data to gauge potential vulnerabilities. Recent fears intensified following unexpectedly strong figures in core PCE inflation, a key indicator closely watched by the Federal Reserve. “Stock markets are generally adverse to tariffs because most of their tax burden falls on the domestic economy, contrary to the White House’s claims,” Dr. Phillip Magness, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Independent Institute told The Post. “But those same markets especially abhor uncertainty, including tariff uncertainty that affects international supply chains and raw material costs on goods such as steel and aluminum.” Magness said that Trump’s “chaotic approach to imposing tariffs has produced the see-saw effect that we’ve seen on Wall Street for the last two months, particularly as the president has vacillated between conflicting tariff threats with self-contradictory rationales” such as protecting favored industries to increasing tax revenue yields. Investors are turning their attention to critical upcoming data releases, including the March jobs report due this Friday, along with figures on private payrolls and job openings. Wall Street looks to use the data in hopes of gaining further clarity on economic trends and resilience. Advertisement

CoreWeave's life as a publicly traded company is off to a rough start. The Nvidia-backed (NVDA) cloud-computing company managed to finish Friday, its first day of trading, in line with its IPO price and up from where it opened the session. On Monday morning, though, CoreWeave (CRWV) stock was pulled lower as markets slid. Shares of CoreWeave were recently down about 9% to under $37, below the $39 at which it opened trading last week. Part of the pullback is likely due to broader market concern, with investors jittery about what might happen later this week with the Trump administration tariff policy. That unease has lately weighed on tech shares, among them those associated with artificial intelligence, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the major indexes lower in recent trading today. The company in its IPO sold fewer shares, and at a lower price, than it originally hoped. One backer: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), which on Friday said it had acquired more than 400,000 shares. “There’s a lot of headwinds in the macro. There are headwinds in the AI trade," CEO Mike Intrator said on CNBC Friday. "We definitely had to scale, or right-size, the transaction for where the buy interest was.”

Title: Tesla's first-quarter deliveries are likely to miss the mark, according to analysts

Time Published: 2025-03-31T15:13:00Z
Full Content:
Tesla (TSLA+3.90%) investors should brace themselves for first-quarter sales that fail to impress, analysts say, as the backlash over Elon Musk’s politics and his role in mass layoffs take a toll on the company. Analysts on average expect Tesla on Wednesday to report deliveries of 408,000 electric vehicles for the January to March quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.99%). Several analysts have downgraded their expectations to below 400,000 in recent weeks, as domestic protests against Tesla have raged and international sales slumped. Deutsche Bank (DB+1.25%) analysts last week reduced its first-quarter forecast by about 50,000 units to 345,000 deliveries, which would translate to an 11% year-over-year drop and a 30% decrease from the previous quarter. Deutsche also lowered its full-year estimate to 1.7 million units sold from 2.1 million units, a 5% decline compared to 2024. Tesla has forecasted a “return to growth” in 2025 after narrowly missing its 2024 sales goal and recording its first annual sales decline. In October, Musk forecasted sales growth of 30% for 2025. “The main drivers of the downside are weakness in Europe and the Model Y Juniper changeover,” analysts led by Edison Yu said, referring to Tesla’s updated electric SUV. Tesla’s sales in the European Union fell 49% in January and February compared to a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association, with just 19,000 units registered. JATO Dynamics found that registrations of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell by 65% and 14%, respectively, in February. In China, where domestic automakers including BYD (BYDDY-1.21%) and Xiaomi (XIACF-4.99%) are growing their share of the market and electrified-vehicle sales are soaring, Tesla’s sales fell 49% year-over-year in February. The firm sold 30,688 vehicles, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. Tesla has struggled to launch its advanced driver assistance technology in China, even as BYD plans to attach its “God’s Eye” software to just about all vehicles it sells. Some Chinese automakers are also able to sell their cars for dirt cheap. In the U.S., RBC Capital Markets (RY+0.51%) thinks Tesla will report 152,000 vehicles sold, according to a March 27 note. Analysts expect to see sales slammed by the recent string of protests against Tesla, which organizers view as an extension of Musk and his influence. Thousands have joined the “Takedown Tesla” demonstrations organized to protest Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, while critical owners of Tesla stock — and other investors fearing a crash — have been selling their shares. Acts of vandalism against Tesla facilities and vehicles have become more frequent, even pushing Tesla out of a major Canadian auto show whose organizers were worried about backlash. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA+0.10%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 34% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. Shares are down almost 6% in intraday trading on Monday. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM+1.26%) analysts recently wrote of DOGE’s impact on Tesla. But it’s still unclear how much that brand damage — which began with Musk’s support of Trump during the 2024 election — will impact sales. Deutsche analysts, for example, noted that they believe “there is some level of brand damage” happening in Western Europe and “pockets” of the U.S. and Canada, but quantifying it is trickier to tell. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right wing had already irritated some potential customers with opposing views. In EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. Conservatives, meanwhile, have embraced Musk; Trump has bought himself a Model S and his administration has promised to treat people vandalizing Tesla facilities as domestic terrorists. It’s still unclear how their support will translate into sales. Tesla will report its sales on Wednesday just hours before Trump’s planned 25% tariffs on vehicle imports will go into effect. The tariff will be extended to impact imported auto parts no later than May 3. That will affect just about every major automaker selling cars in the U.S., including Tesla, and may negatively impact sales. Musk has said the cost impact of the tariffs will not be “trivial” and that Tesla won’t be left unscathed. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on a January earnings call that the tariffs will hit the company’s business and profitability. In a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla said that even with “aggressive” localization of the supply chain, some parts are “difficult or impossible” to source domestically. Between 60% and 75% of the parts used in Tesla’s electric vehicles are made in the U.S., although that varies by model. “[I]t is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a US consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Monday note. “The winner in our view from this tariff is no one....as even Tesla still is clearly hit from these tariffs and will be forced to raise prices,” Ives, a major Tesla bull, added.

The market’s highest-performing tech stocks, the Magnificent 7, mostly slid on Monday amid worries over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Tesla (TSLA+3.90%) was down 4.8% at 11:30 a.m., while Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%) was off 4.1%, Amazon (AMZN+2.48%) was 3% lower, Meta (META+0.80%) fell 2.1% Microsoft (MSFT+0.44%) dropped 2.5%, and Alphabet (GOOGL+0.36%) was down by 1.1%. Apple (AAPL+0.65%) stock was the outlier among the Mag 7, rising 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes fell 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed earlier losses to rise about 88 points, or 0.2%. The Trump administration is expected to announce new tariffs on Wednesday that could include his so-called reciprocal tariff plan. The White House is currently debating over implementing individualized tariffs on trading partners, or an across-the-board tariff impacting all U.S. trade, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA+0.04%) reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The president reportedly wants more aggression on tariffs, and has asked his team for plans to impose higher rates of tariffs on more countries, according to the Wall Street Journal. One plan reportedly involves tariffs of up to 20% on mostly all of the country’s trading partners. Trump has also reportedly pushed for import taxes on goods from countries that the U.S. has a trade deficit with. The Trump administration may also introduce industry-specific tariffs, including those that would impact critical minerals and related products, on Wednesday, but that’s not yet certain. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS+2.88%) economists bumped their forecast of the odds of a recession over the next 12 months to 35% from 20%. The increase “reflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies,” the economists wrote in a note.

Title: Bitcoin nears overbought zone – Why the risk of more losses remains high

Bitcoin faces uncertain market conditions, approaching oversold levels and volatility, with potential opportunities for long-term investors. The “Liberation Day” that U.S. President Donald Trump has discussed is approaching. Heading into the week, U.S. tech stocks saw losses in the overnight trading, with Tesla [TSLA] and Nvidia [NVDA] posting 5% and 3% losses, respectively. The Kobeissi Letter noted that the economic policy uncertainty reached the highest it has since 2020, with the 2nd of April being the date to watch. Moreover, the U.S. jobs report will arrive on the 4th of April, which could also influence market sentiment outside of the tariff news. Gold ETFs saw massive capital inflows, likely a direct consequence of the growing economic uncertainty. This has also put Bitcoin [BTC] and the rest of the crypto sphere on the back foot, as they are risk-on assets. AMBCrypto delved into on-chain metrics to understand if BTC can stabilize around the March lows at $78k or if investors should expect more losses. Source: Checkonchain The short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Bands chart showed that the oscillator was in oversold conditions in late February and early March. Also, the price of Bitcoin was below the cost-basis of short-term holders. This is calculated using the realized price of coins moved within the last 155 days. The price of BTC had been “heated up” in November and December but has cooled off significantly since then. Bitcoin was likely to move below the oversold level, which stood at $78.95k at press time. Source: Checkonchain The Mayer multiple serves as a key metric for determining whether Bitcoin is fairly priced, overvalued, or undervalued based on historical trends. Analysts calculate it by dividing Bitcoin’s market price by its 200-day Moving Average (MA). At press time, the Mayer multiple stood at 0.96. Two weeks ago, BTC fell below its 200DMA and has traded just below this level for most of this time. It stood at $85.92k at press time. The last time the price fell below the 200 DMA was August 2024. The price stayed below this MA for almost two months back then. A similar scenario could unfold now. Investors looking to buy BTC cheap should keep an eye on the 0.8 Mayer multiple, which represented the $68.74k level. Bitcoin would be considered “cheap” around this price level. In conclusion, long-term investors need to hunker down and weather the economic storm of the coming weeks and months. Once the sentiment across the market begins to shift, the trend might shift bullishly. Until then, they can Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into BTC or wait for nasty price drops from giant liquidation events to grab more BTC.

Title: Elon Musk says his DOGE gig has cost him and Tesla 'a lot'

Elon Musk acknowledged that his role overseeing President Donald Trump’s efforts to slash federal spending is costing him — and Tesla (TSLA+3.90%) — “a lot.” Backlash over Musk’s job leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration’s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day. His Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by his support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Non-violent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA+0.10%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. The idea of DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Musk said on Sunday. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.” Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 30% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. He still has a more than $100 billion lead over the next richest person in the world, Amazon (AMZN+2.48%) founder Jeff Bezos. Tesla stock dropped by more than 5% to $248 per share in pre-market trading on Monday as investors await weaker first-quarter sales than previously expected. Deliveries are expected to have taken a hit from the “Tesla Takedown” protests that have continued to put pressure on Tesla, as well as weaker sales in Europe and China. “Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity,” Musk said from a political event in Wisconsin, where he took the stage wearing a cheesehead hat. The Tesla CEO was in Wisconsin on Sunday to support Brad Schimel, who has been endorsed by Republicans in the state’s Supreme Court election scheduled for Tuesday. Musk and his allies have spent more than $20 million campaigning across the state. On Sunday, Musk handed out $1 million checks to two local voters who had expressed support for Schimel and signed a petition supporting his candidacy. A third individual had earlier received a $1 million check. Those people were also named as spokespeople for his America PAC, a tactic that allows the group to side-step accusations of running an illegal lottery. A similar strategy was employed by Musk to hand out $1 million checks to more than a dozen people during the 2024 presidential election. “Easiest money you ever made!” Musk said on Monday, advocating for people to get Wisconsin residents to sign America PAC’s petition and post a photo supporting Schimel. “Every time you do that you get $20 and they get $20. The goal is to build awareness about the election tomorrow, so this offer applies to today and tomorrow.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks fell on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump has pushed his team to be more aggressive on tariffs in recent days. The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Nasdaq Composite 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6% as of 9:54 a.m. EDT. Shares of the Magnificent 7 mostly extended their declines. The losses were 6.4% for Tesla (TSLA+3.90%), 5% for Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%), 4% for Amazon (AMZN+2.48%), 3.4% for Meta (META+0.80%), 2.7% for Microsoft (MSFT+0.44%), and 2.2% for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.36%). Apple (AAPL+0.65%) was little changed. Automakers were mixed, with Stellantis (STLA+0.45%) dropping 1.9%, General Motors (GM+1.71%) off just 0.2% and Ford (F+3.17%) gaining 0.6%. Advisers have considered instituting tariffs of up to 20% on almost all U.S. trading partners, the Journal said, adding that Trump has pushed to levy import taxes on goods from all countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. The possibility of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs remains on the table, it added. He’s due to make a major announcement on tariffs on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (GS+2.88%) economists increased their forecast odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 20% to 35%. The Chicago Business Barometer PMI for March unexpectedly increased to 47.6 from 45.5 in February. The consensus estimate had been for 44.1. A reading under 50 indicates contraction. Here are some stocks to watch today. The Bank of China’s (BACHY+0.81%) ADRs jumped 7.8% after the lender disclosed a planned sale of new shares to Chinese government entities to boost Tier 1 equity capital. China Construction Bank (CICHY-0.11%), the Bank of Communications (BCMXY0.00%), and the Postal Savings Bank of China also disclosed similar stock sales. Coinbase (COIN+4.53%) slid 4% as Bitcoin declined, the WSJ reported. Other crypto-sensitive shares fell, including Robinhood (HOOD+2.49%), by 5.1%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR+2.04%), by 4.6%. Moderna (MRNA+3.20%) stock plunged 12% after the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, resigned and told the acting commissioner that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is seeking subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” according to the Associated Press. U.S. Bancorp (USB+2.15%) Vice Chair Terry Dolan, the lender’s chief administration officer, may have died on Sunday afternoon after the plane he was believed to be piloting crashed near Minneapolis. The stock fell about 0.7%. Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav has started meeting candidates who could replace film studio heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. The talks are early and no final decision has been made on the two executives’ futures. The stock fell 1.% Monday morning.

U.S. stock futures are plunging as investors review the latest comments from President Donald Trump on tariffs, with more import taxes expected to be announced this Wednesday; Goldman Sachs sees tariffs boosting inflation and slowing economic growth; cryptocurrency-tied stocks Strategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are falling in premarket trading along with the price of bitcoin; and Nvidia (NVDA)-backed CoreWeave (CRWV) stock is declining after a flat debut Friday. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are tumbling as investors prepare for Wednesday's tariffs announcements from President Donald Trump. Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower and S&P 500 futures are down 1.1% after the indexes closed in negative territory Friday for the fifth time in the past six weeks. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 0.7% lower after also declining last week. Gold futures are jumping to trade at about $3,150 an ounce. Oil futures are edging higher. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are falling below 4.2%. Investors are awaiting updates on tariffs after reports that the Trump administration could expand proposals to include a 20% across-the-board import tax on all U.S. trading partners, according to The Wall Street Journal . The report comes ahead of Wednesday's expected announcement on "reciprocal" tariffs in response to import taxes on U.S.-made goods. Trump told NBC News over the weekend that he "couldn't care less" if proposed automobile tariffs raise prices, arguing it would help promote U.S. car manufacturing. Shares of "Big Three" automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), as well as Tesla (TSLA), are lower in premarket trading. Goldman Sachs economists raised their forecast for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts to three this year and increased their probability of a U.S. recession to 35% from 20%, as President Trump's tariffs put pressure on economic growth. Goldman now sees "core" inflation rising at an annual rate of 3.5% to end 2025, GDP growth slipping to 1%, and U.S. unemployment increasing to 4.5%. "We continue to believe the risk from April 2 tariffs is greater than many market participants have previously assumed," they wrote. Shares of cryptocurrency-related stocks are falling in premarket trading as the price of bitcoin (BTCUSD) trades below $84,000. Bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) stock is down 4% after sinking 10% Friday. Shares of bitcoin mining firms MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN), and trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) also are down after posting sharp losses Friday. Shares of cloud computing firm CoreWeave (CRWV) are more than 4% lower in premarket trading after ending flat at their IPO price of $40 per share in their first day of trading. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave is backed by artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), whose shares are also lower by more than 4% in early trading.

Laughter. Oh, how we need laughter these days. The weight of the world is almost too much to bear. The news. The stock market. The price of (fucking) eggs. The fact that the third season of The White Lotus is almost over. Not that anyone asked, but I think April Fools’ Day 2025 is just what we need. (That and a time machine.) Though I was a sweet but serious kid, I always loved April Fools’ Day. Like Pajama Day at school, or my dad’s green pancakes on St. Patrick’s Day, any departure from the quotidian routine gave me a thrill. And that’s never changed. The origins of April Fools’ Day are murky. Some think it arose in the Middle Ages, when the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar shifted New Year’s Day from spring to January 1. Not everyone observes the holiday on April 1, but countries from France and Brazil to Iran and India dedicate at least one calendar day to jokes and pranks. (In Spain, they have an annual food fight.) There’s something heartwarming about a global norm, agreed to across cultures, that celebrates playfulness and laughter. We are so often divided, but laughter can bring us together. But why do I love this day so much? To find out, I did what every good (faux) investigative journalist does: I asked my therapist. Dr. H’s first impulse was to go dark. She said it could reflect unconscious rage or the desire for power in a relationship, since the goal of a prank is to put one over on someone—and laugh at them. I didn’t want to think that could be true of me. Do I have hidden rage lurking in my subconscious? Probably? (Shrug.) But also, what woman doesn’t? The rage theory didn’t land as a puzzle piece sliding into place. Fortunately, as I gave her some of my examples, she laughed and revised her opinion. For me, she said, it might be about connection. I love to laugh, and thinking deeply about how to laugh at somebody and with them is a way of showing I care. The Clinton impeachment sent the little prankster in me into hibernation (a global scandal will do that to ya). But a few years later, I reclaimed my playful side with the help of a friend and neighbor in NYC, Ann. Now Ann pranked people all year long…and she was good. But April Fools’ Day was her Super Bowl. From her I learned the two keys to success: Always start with a kernel of truth, and always go all in on the joke. My inability to keep a straight face was an obstacle, but technology eventually fixed that. Pranking over text became my specialty. So in a feeble attempt to bring some joy to you today, here are Monica Lewinsky’s Greatest April Fools’ Day Hits: The morning of April 1, I sent a group text to my mom, dad, stepmom, brother, and sister-in-law, saying: Morning. There will be an announcement that comes out today. I have my reasons which I’ll explain later, but so you’re not shocked, I decided to do ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Love you. Silence. Then more silence. A few minutes later, I got a call from my mom. My brother had called her worried and apoplectic. “What is she DOING?! She just gave a TED Talk!” (There might have been some expletives in there.) An hour after that, I got a text from my stepmom: “Please call your dad. He has not figured out this is a joke and is worried because with your bad ankles you’re not a great dancer. He’s called me three times.” To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with doing DWTS. It’s just not the obvious next step in taking back your narrative after giving a TED Talk! However you choose to celebrate this April Fools’ Day, I hope you make it a good one and laugh your ass off. Oh, and by the way, since I have this platform here, I was given permission to announce in the pages of Vanity Fair that I’m joining season four of The White Lotus. Location: the White House.

Title: CoinShares' Bitcoin Mining ETF Is the Worst Performing Fund of This Year

CoinShares' Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining (WGMI) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is the worst-performing ETF of 2025, down 43% year-to-date, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETF is made up of several publicly traded bitcoin (BTC) miners. IREN (IREN) is the largest holding at 15%, which is down 42%. Core Scientific (CORZ) follows with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, is down 52%. Even NVIDIA (NVDA), the sixth-largest holding at 5%, has dropped over 20% this year. According to its investment strategy, "The ETF will invest in companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from bitcoin mining operations and/or from providing specialized chips, hardware, software, or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining." WGMI consists of 21 holdings and manages $147.2 million in total assets. In contrast, metals ETFs have been the top performers of 2025, according to justETF. Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date. Bitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate—representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin—continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin’s price and the hash rate. As a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. NVDA Stock Nvidia stock has fallen around 5% in the past week and is currently down nearly 12% over the last month. So, what has triggered the recent sell-off in Nvidia shares? Nvidia is facing mixed developments in China. According to the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission has introduced new energy-efficiency standards for advanced chips used in data centers. These new regulations could effectively prevent Nvidia’s H20 chip from being used by Chinese firms expanding or building new data centers. The H20 is Nvidia’s leading chip tailored for China, featuring scaled-back capabilities to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Compared to Nvidia’s top-tier Blackwell processors available elsewhere, the H20 is less advanced. Resellers operating in the gray market have reportedly been using entities registered outside of China to acquire Nvidia’s newest chips, including the Blackwell GPUs—which are prohibited from being sold to Chinese customers—via companies based in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Recently, Singapore charged three individuals in connection with a fraud case involving the suspected resale of Nvidia chips through Malaysia to China. Under pressure from the U.S., Malaysia is now working with both the U.S. and Singapore to monitor the distribution of Nvidia’s high-end chips and to strengthen semiconductor regulations. These concerns are particularly noteworthy, as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, contributing approximately $23 billion in revenue for FY’25 (ended January 26), accounting for 18% of total sales—an increase from $2.3 billion, or about 8% of revenue, in FY’23. In contrast, China officially made up 13% of revenue in FY’25. Increased regulatory attention on these transactions could have implications for Nvidia stock. There is increasing skepticism about the sustainability of the current AI spending surge. Evidence suggests that the massive capital allocation by major U.S. tech companies could begin to taper. In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI model that operates at a significantly lower cost than those of most Western competitors. This development could encourage companies to shift away from hardware-heavy strategies and focus on more efficient solutions. Moreover, returns from AI investments have been underwhelming so far, causing concern among investors—particularly if the U.S. economy weakens. With inflation expected to rise again and economic growth potentially slowing under new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, market apprehensions are growing. Reports this week noted that Microsoft canceled several data center projects across the U.S. and Europe in the last six months, citing demand not matching supply. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s Chairman Joe Tsai also recently warned of a potential bubble in AI and data center investments. The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump? We currently value Nvidia stock at around $101 per share, which is roughly 10% below its current market price of $112. See our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons behind our slightly bearish view on the stock right now. One is the potential decline in the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI rally seen over the past two years, due to diminishing performance returns from increasingly large models and challenges in accessing high-quality training data. A transition toward more efficient AI models could amplify headwinds for GPU producers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia may encounter increased competition from companies such as AMD and even some of its own customers like Amazon, which are developing and deploying proprietary AI chips. While Nvidia benefits from a strong software ecosystem that complements its AI hardware—helping retain customers—it may still face pressures. At its current premium valuation, the stock might not fully account for these risks.

Title: Webscale Market Review Report 4Q 2024: AI and Data Center Investments Push Webscale Capex Past $300 Billion in 4Q24

March 31, 2025 04:03 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Market Review, 4Q24: Annual capex breaks the $300B mark" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (webscale, aka hyperscale) market since 2011. The webscale market consists of big tech providers building large networks of data centers as part of their operations. The webscale tracker covers 22 companies. In 2024, webscalers represented $2.596 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.4% YoY), $314 billion (B) in R&D spending (+7.1% YoY), and $304B in capex (+55.5% YoY). They had $643B of cash and short-term investments (-5.3% YoY) on the books as of December 2024, and $545B in total debt (-3.4% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of December 2024 was $922B, up 28.3% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.234 million (M) people at the end of 4Q24, up 1.2% from the Dec. 2023 total of 4.185M. Below are highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 4Q24 were $745.3 billion (B), up 9.9% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.596 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For six straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth. For the 4Q24 annualized period, among larger companies, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 21.9% versus 2023, followed by Microsoft (+15.0%), Alphabet (13.9%), and Amazon (11.0%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 4Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $17.8 billion from 4Q23 to end 4Q24 at $187.8B, up 10.5% YoY. The only curbs on growth in 4Q24 were Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu and Chinese search specialist Baidu, both of which reported modest declines. Capex: After declining 3% in 2023, webscale capex grew at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 26%, 53%, 61%, and 78% YoY in the four quarters of the year. 4Q24 capex of $100.2B pushed the annualized total to $304.4B, up 56% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. Some companies claim they are struggling to procure all the GPUs they want, and prices are unusually high, both due to NVIDIA's market power. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 48% of annualized capex in 2022, Network/IT and software capex was 60% of total capex in 2024. The biggest capex outlays in 4Q24 came from Amazon ($27.8B), Microsoft ($15.8B), Meta ($14.4B), and Alphabet ($14.3B). These four account for over 70% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 16.3% in 2024, a bit lower than the 18.6% average of 2023. Average net profit margin for 2024 was 19.9%, a bit higher than 17.5% in 2023. Net margins are around the same level as in the year before COVID, but free cash flow margins have dropped recently due to high capex spend. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft were 1-2-3 for FCF margins in 2024 overall. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. In gauging webscalers' ability to fund their capex, their recent levels of free cash flow profitability is one factor to consider. The overall level of average margins is a bit low relative to history, and it's moving in the wrong direction. Webscalers can afford this for a few quarters, but not for a few years. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in December 2024, slightly up from 4.185 million in December 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 4Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 4Q24 revenue growth was 6% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Asia should have a good 2025, though. Both Tencent and Alibaba appear to have strong government support to expand and grow tech spending over the next 2-3 years. That should help to accelerate Asian regional growth.

Title: AI's "Biggest Test" Is Turning Into a Catastrophe as CoreWeave Flounders
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-test-coreweave
Time Published: 2025-03-31T00:48:52Z
Full Content:
So far, the AI industry has enjoyed smooth sailing. It's courted billions in slap-happy investments and sign-first, read-later contracts, ballooning some Silicon Valley companies to the top of the financial food chain. Now it's facing its toughest challenge yet in the form of CoreWeave, the AI processing company that went public on the stock market this week and the first all-AI startup to do so. It was said to be a major test for the industry — and so far it's failing, miserably. CoreWeave stocks hit the public market with a wet thud on Friday, opening at $39, down slightly from its IPO price of $40 per share, which was already reduced from the highest projection of $55 per share the previous week. The company's hopes of raising $4 billion in the offering thus fell way short at a soggy $1.5 billion. That flat opening helped spurn a rough day for the Magnificent 7 — the term used to describe Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft — which all tumbled following announcements of Donald Trump's auto tariffs. Nvidia, the chip giant that's tried to prop up CoreWeave, saw its stock price fall 1.5 percent on Friday, after a 2.1 percent fall on Thursday. Apple, meanwhile, fell 2.5 percent, while Amazon tumbled 4.5 percent, and Tesla dived 3.7 ahead of worldwide protests aimed at CEO Elon Musk. Though CoreWeave isn't entirely to blame for the M7's terrible rotten day, its failure to instill faith in the tech industry and stave off mounting losses still feels like a big deal. The company's entire business model hinges on the mass adoption of generative AI — a resource-intensive technology whose main impact so far has been polluting the internet with computer generated slop. If CoreWeave does well, it would be a major boost for the tech industry, kicking off even more demand for chips and a wave of AI IPOs. However, if CoreWeave can't survive despite the massive contracts it has with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia, then investors will have little reason to trust the generative AI hype going forward — something many have questioned after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek suggested a sustainable alternative to US AI development. And unfortunately for American AI hopefuls, there's little reason to think CoreWeave can hold out the next six months, let alone lead the AI revolution. As tech critic Ed Zitron notes, CoreWeave is a company primed for disaster. Its business is far from stable, relying on those huge revenue injections over sustainable, diversified income. According to the company's financial filings, 77 percent of CoreWeave's revenue comes from just two customers — meaning the company could collapse like a house of cards if just one of its clients cancels a contract. Meanwhile, it has what Zitron calls a "fatal amount of debt" via loans from companies like Blackstone and Magnetar. The interest alone on CoreWeave's top two loans could be as much as $1.5 billion per year thanks to some high-risk terms, suggesting a lack of faith from the company's lenders. All told, it's a pretty lame showing given all the hype we've heard from AI tycoons. The next few months will tell whether they can keep CoreWeave — and the AI industry — afloat as the market grows impatient with empty promises.

A tweet or a regulatory shift can send prices soaring, while unexpected market shocks like trade wars can wipe out billions of dollars in minutes. This volatility is behind two key terms that define cryptocurrency market cycles: bull and bear markets. Understanding these trends isn’t just about knowing when to buy or sell—it’s about survival. The differences between a bull and bear market are simple yet complex. A bull market fuels optimism, risk-taking, and price surges, while a bear market brings fear, sell-offs, and a test of investor resilience. This article will explain what defines these market conditions, and how they impact cryptocurrency. The terms "bull market" and "bear market" date back to the 18th century. A bull charges with its horns upward, symbolizing rising prices, while a bear swipes downward, representing a market decline. In traditional equities markets, a bull market is generally defined as a sustained period of rising stock prices, typically lasting months or years, with gains of 20% or more. With a few key differences, bull and bear markets in crypto function much the same as traditional finance. Unlike legacy markets, however, crypto cycles are amplified by: Cryptocurrency investors rely on technical, macroeconomic, and on-chain analysis to identify trends and effectively navigate market cycles. “Standard technical analysis tools like moving averages, Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands, can help signal cyclical shifts along with correlated markets such as the NASDAQ and Tech Stocks,” Mike Marshall, Amberdata’s head of research, told Decrypt. “Additionally, macro factors, including Fed policy, inflation, and global events, also heavily influence crypto cycles.” On January 20, 2025, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,786, spurred on by the hope of a friendlier regulatory environment in the United States under newly re-elected President Donald Trump, who had promised the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some analysts speculated that the industry was in a bull market, with some even calling it a 'supercycle'—a prolonged period of economic expansion driven by sustained demand and investor optimism. However, that narrative was challenged when Bitcoin tumbled more than 31% to nearly $73,000 two months later. “Everyone seemed to be saying that when the Trump administration comes in, it's going to give such a huge boost to crypto regulations,” Alice Liu, Head of Research at CoinMarketCap, told Decrypt at ETH Denver. “But so far, we haven't seen that play out in action.” However, as Liu explained, this drop in Bitcoin’s price did not necessarily mean a bear market had taken over. “This is a technical pullback as opposed to a structural change. The reason for that is the liquidity is still healthy,” she said. Liquidity—how easily assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting price—is key in distinguishing bull and bear markets. High liquidity indicates a market where transactions occur smoothly, with minimal price volatility, due to a large number of active buyers and sellers. In bear markets, liquidity tends to dry up as trading slows, amplifying price volatility. “Even in reaction to the market shock, we saw a definite spike in trade volume, averaging around $150 million to $160 million daily,” Liu said. “And even now, as the dust has settled a little, we still see a healthy trade volume moving through the market.” Defining the start of a Bitcoin bull market isn’t always straightforward, since different analysts use varying metrics to pinpoint its beginning. Some argue that it starts when prices recover from a major downturn, while others believe it only becomes clear once previous all-time highs are surpassed. “Technically, one could say the bull market begins with capitulation, as prices start to rise, but most people only perceive a bull market in Bitcoin after the prior all-time high is reached until the bubble pops about a year later,” Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Ventures, told Decrypt. Capitulation is when an investor, often driven by fear or panic, gives up on trying to recover losses and sells their assets. This typically happens after a prolonged market downturn triggered by a massive event, like the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Investors who hold onto their cryptocurrency despite being in a bear market, and mounting pressures to sell, are considered to have “diamond hands.” The term "diamond hands" originated in 2018 on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. Not all financial analysts agree that a 20% swing should be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory. “I think the typical 20% threshold that’s commonly used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be as applicable to crypto, due to the wider price moves in the latter and the 24/7 trading that makes crypto more sensitive to global events,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong told Decrypt. As Duong explained, crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices. “I’d be more inclined to use metrics like the 200-day moving average, in combination with measuring the sustainability of the given upside or downside move,” he said. “For example, how long the move lasts to define a bull or bear market.” While crypto markets share similarities with traditional financial markets, they have unique characteristics—including extreme volatility, higher sensitivity to hype, and regulatory changes that set them apart. “When it comes to cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators, I prefer the Market Value to Realized Value ratio or the MVRV z-score to gauge how markets are moving,” Duong said. Investor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends. Measures like the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the Put/Call Ratio, and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey help gauge investor confidence and risk appetite. One widely followed metric, the Fear and Greed Index, aggregates market factors to assess whether investors lean toward caution or excitement. The Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear, suggesting cautious or bearish investor sentiment, and higher values reflecting greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior. On March 30, 2025, as of this writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear), up from 17 (Extreme Fear) earlier in the month. While such indices don’t predict price movements, they often reflect broader shifts in investor thinking. “Investors often look to sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom,” Joe Vezzani, CEO and co-founder of crypto sentiment aggregator LunarCrush, told Decrypt. “Current crypto market sentiment reached its lowest point since August 2024, when volatility spiked due to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.” For financial analyst Jacob King, founder and CEO of WhaleWire, market sentiment also depends on whether investors believe the data. “Indicators exist—if you trust the data, which is questionable,” King told Decrypt. “Bitcoin falling below the 200-day moving average is a major red flag. When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.” Markets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties. “It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain.

View all partners The first months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been defined by a single word: tariffs. He has framed tariffs as a panacea to the woes of the American economy, promising they will restore the country’s manufacturing sector and reduce the national deficit. As the United States’ largest trading partner, Canada’s smaller economy is poised to suffer the most from a prolonged trade war. Although the price of all consumer goods will be affected, the grocery aisle has become a particular battleground. Canadians have remained defiant, with vows to “buy Canadian” already spurring rapid drops in the sale of American products. But with calls for the country to strengthen its economic backbone and reduce dependence on the U.S., perhaps it’s also time to consider rebooting Canada’s grocery sector to better serve Canadians as well. Read more: Canada is now in a trade war with the U.S. — here's what you need to know to prepare for it Rising grocery bills have been an ongoing concern for Canadians long before Trump’s inauguration. Today, an estimated 18 per cent of Canadians are struggling with food insecurity owing to persistent inflation and the rising cost of living. Food banks saw a record number of monthly visits in 2024 as a result. Yet, even as consumers feel the squeeze, Canada’s grocery giants have been posting record profits. Loblaw Companies Limited, whose supermarkets hold a dominant 28 per cent share of the sector, has become the poster child for this trend. In the final quarter of 2022, as Canadians were grappling with rapid inflation on their grocery bills, Loblaw posted $529 million in profits — up 30 per cent from the previous year. This has led customers to accuse Loblaw and other large grocery chains of profiteering, provoking both a 100,000 signature petition against “greedflation” and a month-long boycott of Loblaw chains. All this while Loblaw was still reeling from a bread price-fixing scandal yielding a $500 million antitrust settlement. Read more: Food giants reap enormous profits during times of crisis In response to the mounting concerns, the federal government met with the heads of Loblaw, Sobeys, Metro, Costco and Walmart in 2023 to discuss stabilizing grocery prices in Canada. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would threaten and later implement amendments to the Competition Act through Bill C-56, although these reforms were focused less on immediately lowering grocery bills and more on giving new tools to Canada’s competition watchdog. Another area of concern is the initiatives supermarket chains such as Loblaw and Metro have been investing their profits in. Since 2020, supermarkets in Canada have invested heavily in self-checkout aisles. While initially a concession to the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, these kiosks have become a ubiquitous — and often unwelcome — part of the retail experience for both workers and consumers. Beyond the concern that self-checkouts pressure customers to perform more work, they have also increased the precarity of supermarket employees. These technologies generally reduce total worker hours and eliminate well-paying full-time positions, all with an eye towards boosting profit margins. Read more: The rise of robo-retail: Who gets left behind when retail is automated? Loblaw has also invested in automating their fleet of delivery vehicles, jeopardizing jobs in the logistics sector at a time when Canada’s unemployment rate, already struggling to recover, is expected to rise due to Trump’s tariffs. There is also the looming concern of dynamic pricing. Following the lead of American grocery stores such as Kroger, chains run by Loblaw, Metro and Sobeys have begun to implement electronic price tags. These tags enable retailers to instantaneously update prices based on supply and demand, similar to surge pricing on ride-sharing apps like Uber. While online commentators were quick to mock fast food chain Wendy’s for potentially using dynamic pricing to charge more for a Frosty on a hot day, this practice becomes more problematic as the availability of family staples like baby formula, which already experiences perennial scarcity, are affected by the trade war. There is little reason to believe Canada’s grocery industry will reform itself. Many of the pro-consumer and pro-worker initiatives put forth by these chains have amounted to little more than public relations moves. The much-lauded COVID hero pay for front-line grocery workers disappeared only months into the pandemic, despite pressure from unions and MPs during the Omicron wave. Loblaw’s widely publicized price freeze on No Name products was similarly criticised for its short duration and for merely repackaging seasonal price freezes as a pro-consumer initiative. The company’s promise to create a discounted version of its already discounted grocery chain No Frills drew further scepticism, with the stock being entirely sourced from Loblaw brands that generate higher revenue for the company. The question remains: what concrete measures can be implemented to safeguard Canadian grocery bills as our country navigates this next crisis? A report from the Broadbent Institute suggests the idea of a windfall profit tax, which would incentivize grocery companies to invest excess profits into price reductions or higher wages. A more durable reform would involve creating a central bank-style regulatory entity to oversee the grocery industry, instead of relying on industry-born measures such as Canada’s recently introduced grocery code of conduct. Read more: The new Grocery Code of Conduct should benefit both Canadians and the food industry Federal or provincial legislation could be also passed that places guardrails on dynamic pricing in the grocery aisle, if not banning the controversial practice altogether. Government grants and tax incentive programs could be withheld from companies that invest heavily into automating workforces so the government isn’t inadvertently subsidizing job losses. The Competition Bureau’s 2023 report highlights another key issue: there is a need for all levels of government to shift from subsidizing large chains and encourage the growth of independent grocers in the Canadian market, driving down prices for consumers through meaningful, local competition. Trump’s trade war has filled Canadians with a newfound pride and motivation to buy local to support the economy.

Title: Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Title: Googlers have questions for the company after getting smaller pay bumps

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts. More of this week's top reads: VCs are in a 'frenzy' to invest in Anduril, but good luck getting ahold of shares. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

VodafoneIdea says, Govt to convert dues into equity, to get shares worth Rs 36,950 cr at an issue price of Rs 10/sh --Govt’s holding to increase to 49% from 22.6% --Promoters will continue to have operation control of the company Macroeconomic Data Releases: The HSBC India Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for March, due on April 4, will provide insights into the health of India’s manufacturing and services sectors. A strong PMI reading could lift market sentiment, while a weaker-than-expected figure might dampen it. Auto sales data for March, typically released by companies early in the month, will be in focus. Given the festive season’s tail-end effects and economic activity, robust sales numbers could support auto stocks and broader market indices. Global Economic Influences: Key U.S. economic data, including the Composite PMI and Initial Jobless Claims, expected during the week, could sway global markets, including India. Strong U.S. data might bolster confidence, while signs of weakness could fuel volatility, especially amid ongoing tariff concerns. The looming U.S. reciprocal tariffs, set to be detailed on April 2, are a significant wildcard. Proposed by the Trump administration, these tariffs (e.g., 25% on auto imports) could impact Indian exporters, particularly in the auto and manufacturing sectors, potentially triggering a cautious market response. Domestic Market Dynamics: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) flows will remain critical. After being net sellers of ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY25 so far (as of late March), any shift in FII behavior—driven by global cues or domestic data—could move indices like the Sensex and Nifty. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) next monetary policy decision is slated for April, with speculation of a 25-basis-point repo rate cut. While the decision itself falls outside next week, any preemptive signals or market expectations could influence sentiment. Corporate and Sectoral Updates: The last day of the financial year (March 31) will see final portfolio adjustments, potentially affecting stock closing prices. This could lead to heightened volatility on Monday. Early Q4 earnings updates or guidance from companies might start trickling in, setting the tone for sector-specific movements. Technical and Sentiment Factors: The Nifty’s recent performance, closing below key levels like 23,550 (as noted in some analyses), suggests bearish pressure. Market participants will watch if it holds above 23,500 or tests lower supports around 22,400, as predicted by some traders. In summary, the Indian stock market next week will likely be shaped by a mix of domestic economic indicators (PMI, auto sales), global developments (U.S. data, tariffs), and technical levels. Investors might adopt a wait-and-see approach, balancing optimism from potential rate cut expectations against risks from international trade tensions. Keep an eye on these events as they unfold for a clearer picture. There are sectors in which it may make sense to chase expensive stocks; Power is not one of them. Indian electric utilities and IPPs face structural power demand growth and a much tighter demand-supply balance for peak power. This is leading to an expanded thermal capex opportunity (benefiting NTPC) and transmission capex opportunity (benefiting PGCIL). The industry has consolidated after a brutal decade in the 2010s, which saw many bankruptcies, leaving the survivors to benefit from rebounding growth. However, power is a tough sector – multiple challenges persist, such as the weak financial health of DISCOMs, delays in the signing of renewable PPAs, the usual execution delays and regulatory interventions. Post-Covid, stocks have re-rated sharply due to strong power demand growth, the resolution of DISCOM payment delays and high trading multiples accorded to renewable growth prospects. The correction in valuations over the past six months has reduced the ‘froth’ in valuations, putting the valuations of regulated utilities (NTPC & PGCIL) in an acceptable zone, in our view. However, we find private IPP/utility valuations still somewhat expensive, especially given execution challenges. We initiate coverage of NTPC and PGCIL at OW, Tata Power and Torrent Power at Neutral, and JSWEL at UW. 📌Piramal Pharma - Out of the 151 molecules in various stages of development, 12 are in preclinical, 68 in Phase-I trials, 38 in Phase-II trials, and 33 are in Phase-III clinical trials.

Central to Rocket Lab's participation is its next-generation Neutron rocket, a reusable carbon composite launch vehicle engineered for medium-lift missions. Neutron is designed to deliver up to 13,000 kilograms to orbit, supporting both single-payload missions and multi-satellite constellation deployments. Built on Rocket Lab's track record of reliability-with 63 Electron launches completed and multiple orbital payload deliveries in 2025 alone-Neutron is positioned as a competitive contender in the defense launch market. Neutron's inaugural launch is scheduled for the latter half of 2025 from Launch Complex 3 at Wallops Island, Virginia. With this mission, Neutron will become the first vehicle to support NSSL operations from the Mid-Atlantic region. Rocket Lab's inclusion in the program required meeting stringent eligibility standards, and a successful debut flight will make the company eligible to receive individual task orders for NSSL missions. The NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program aims to cultivate a diversified and resilient domestic launch capability, selecting just five companies to compete for up to 30 missions through 2029, with a potential extension to 2034. As part of its onboarding, Rocket Lab has secured a $5 million task order to demonstrate its mission assurance framework tailored for national security launches. "Supporting assured access to space for the nation's most important missions has always been the goal with our Neutron rocket, and we're incredibly proud to [be] selected by the U.S. Space Force to demonstrate this commitment for the NSSL. Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability in medium launch, and its selection to the program demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the Department of Defense in Neutron's capabilities ahead of its first launch later this year. We can't wait to showcase Neutron as the important platform it will become for the Department of Defense," said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck.

Title: The Inconvenient Truth about H-1B Visas
URL: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-h-1b-visas/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Americans are told that mass immigration will bring the world’s geniuses to our country. The numbers tell a different story. President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office. Now, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?” Big Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X. Ramaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.” The resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters. A Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse. Trump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process. But what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it? The H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people. At the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.) While the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies. There are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers. A permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process. Once naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program. This is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration. We've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic. Naturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program. Astonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy. That doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story. The H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.” “Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans. Speaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April. The number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S. Infosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance. It's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees. Not surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners. “I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her. While U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?” Other H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.” Again, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America. At least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented. Every year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees. Wily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave. Critics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.” Not only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example: H1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse. Then there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” There are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems. But defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year. These are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs? That's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity. Recent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs. That's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025. A jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers. “There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.” The center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes. “If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job. Immigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period. The discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether. On the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here. Sixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality. Nor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64. Even without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years. This is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)? For MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world. Hayden Ludwig is the director of policy research for Restoration of America.

March 29, 2025 20:08 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon announced this week that Jennifer Salke is stepping down as the head of Amazon MGM Studios — a move that could indicate high-level dissatisfaction with the company’s streaming strategy over the past few years. To be clear, Salke’s boss, Mike Hopkins (the head of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video), praised her work in an email to employees and described her departure as one that allows the company to “flatten our leadership structure a bit” — a recurring theme in recent tech company layoffs. In other words, Amazon does not intend to fill Salke’s role. Instead, the heads of its film and TV studios will report directly to Hopkins. But the reporting around Salke’s departure highlights Amazon’s streaming disappointments and challenges under her leadership. Previously an exec at NBC, Salke joined Amazon Studios in 2018, as the company was looking to expand beyond critically praised movies and shows into more mainstream hits. The streamer has had its share of successes since then, including “Reacher,” “Jack Ryan,” “Fallout,” and “The Boys.” It also made a big bet on “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a show whose premiere drew a record audience for Amazon but has not proven to be the world-conquering phenomenon that you’d hope for with a reported budget of more than $1 billion. And then there’s “Citadel,” an espionage show designed as the epicenter of a fictional universe of global spinoffs like “Citadel: Diana” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny.” Extensive reshoots reportedly turned “Citadel” into the second most expensive show ever made (behind only “The Rings of Power”), but its reception has been even more underwhelming. The Hollywood Reporter says the second season has been delayed from fall 2025 to spring 2026, with further spinoffs put on hold. Amazon has also struggled to get another James Bond film into production, following its acquisition of MGM in 2022. Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was their father) maintained creative control of the franchise, and a Wall Street Journal report in December suggested that Barbara Broccoli was particularly unhappy with Amazon — she was apparently annoyed in an early meeting when Salke referred to Bond as “content,” and she was even reported to have described the tech giant’s team as “idiots.” Another source said that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was, in turn, so angered by the WSJ story about Broccoli that he declared, “I don’t care what it takes, get rid of her,” with the company subsequently paying Wilson and Broccoli to give up control. Salke’s name was noticeably missing from Amazon’s triumphant announcement of the Bond deal. She will, however, be starting a new film and TV production company with a first-look deal at Amazon.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide 14 mg) demonstrates superior reduction in cardiovascular events in the SOUL trial at ACC 2025

March 29, 2025 14:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial, demonstrating that Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)1. These new data from the phase 3b trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US and simultaneously published today in New England Journal of Medicine2. The SOUL trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with type 2 diabetes and CVD and/or CKD when treated with Rybelsus® compared to placebo. Each component of MACE, being CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, contributed to the risk reduction1. “Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of disability and death for people with type 2 diabetes, and there is a need for new, patient-centric treatments to help manage this risk,” said Darren McGuire, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Science and Teaching Professor of Medicine at UT Southwestern, US, and SOUL steering committee co-chair. “The SOUL trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or CKD demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and CV death in those treated with oral semaglutide vs placebo. The proven cardiovascular benefit reflects a profound clinical impact for our patients who now have an oral option to improve health outcomes.” Cardiometabolic diseases span a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease3. When combined, these conditions represent the leading cause of death globally4. Having type 2 diabetes directly increases the risk of developing interconnected cardiometabolic diseases, while also contributing to the progression of other cardiovascular risk factors5. Nearly one in three adults with type 2 diabetes have CVD6. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside our other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide in SOUL was consistent with that seen in previous semaglutide trials, and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in participants receiving Rybelsus® than those receiving placebo, mostly due to the higher rate of cardiovascular events and infections in the placebo group. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders (17.8% and 19.8%, respectively) and infections/infestations (15.0% and 16.5%, respectively) in the Rybelsus® and placebo arms1. In a key secondary analysis from SOUL published simultaneously, oral semaglutide reduced risk of MACE independently of baseline use of SGLT2i and suggests similar benefits in participants with and without concomitant SGLT2i use during trial7. SOUL confirmed the well-established safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient years8. Based on data from the SOUL clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Rybelsus®, which has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA. A decision is anticipated in 2025. About SOUL SOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD9,10. About Rybelsus®Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise11,12. Rybelsus® is administered once daily and is approved for use in three therapeutic dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg13,14. Rybelsus® offers superior blood glucose lowering vs Januvia® and Jardiance®13,14, together with consistent weight reduction13-15 and reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors15. Rybelsus® is currently commercially marketed in 45 countries. More than 2.1 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Rybelsus® worldwide16.

Title: These 100-Year-Old Funds Are Kicking Out Near-10% Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. Different yield and maturities for bonds and interest on stock exchange screen. Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a quiet trend in investing—and today we’re going to tap into it with two funds with near 10% dividends. That’s right: enough to pay you back just shy of 10% of your initial buy a year in dividends alone. What’s more, these two income plays—closed-end funds, to be precise—have been around for nearly a century, with one dating from 1927 and the other having launched in 1929. That last date, of course, is notorious, as it heralded the start of the worst market crash in history. I bring these two CEFs up now because their long institutional memory gives them a level of reliability that few other funds can match. And there’s something else that favors both of them now, too—that quiet shift I mentioned earlier. I’m talking about the move from growth stocks to value stocks that’s started to pick up momentum in recent months. We can catch a hint of that when we look at the performance of the large caps in the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to small caps, as shown below by their benchmark index funds: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), in orange below, and the small-cap-focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple: Large Caps Outperform That nicely sets the table for our two centenarian funds. The General American Investors Company is the oldest of our two CEFs, but not by much. It’s been around since 1927 and holds reliable cash cows like Republic Services (RSG), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). The fund has delivered an annualized return of 8.9% over the past decade, as of this writing. It’s caught our attention now because, at my CEF Insider service, one of the things we look for is a fund with what I like to call “discount momentum.” That’s where a CEF’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio) is still wide but is slowly moving toward par. And that’s the setup we have with GAM now. Take a look. GAM Discount to NAV Currently, GAM trades at a massive 13.3% discount, as you can see above, and that discount has been shrinking over the last year as market volatility prompts more investors to favor value over growth. In the past year, GAM has also paid out a 9.3% dividend, which is a massive amount of income for one fund. Now it is true, that most of the fund’s income is paid out in one big yearly special dividend, so you’ll have to hold on to the fund for a full year to be guaranteed the full payout. But that’s a good thing: At CEF Insider, we see funds as something to be held for the long term. Our second fund, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) was launched just a couple years after GAM, in 1929. That, of course, sent it headlong into the biggest market crash of them all, and the Great Depression. But that experience was the start of the fund’s build-up of the institutional memory that still helps guide its decisions today. That’s a big part of the reason why we bought ADX in one of our first issues of CEF Insider, back in July 2017. Since then, it has delivered a 193% total return for us, as of this writing, showing its long-term mettle. ADX and GAM take similar approaches, with Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple being common top positions, but ADX also has a large holding of NVIDIA (NVDA), which is part of the reason why the fund has posted a bigger “NAV return” (or the performance of its underlying portfolio, including dividends collected) over the last decade. (ADX’s total NAV return is in orange below.) ADX Outperforms GAM ADX’s strategy isn’t too risky, though, as it emphasizes investing in high-quality, large-cap companies, ensuring both growth potential and dividend reliability. Plus, its total dividend yield of 10.9% for 2024, combined with a relatively low management fee (for a CEF) of only 0.61%, makes ADX one of the cheaper CEFs on the fee front. On average, these funds have fees around 2% on average. What’s unusual about ADX is that it has outperformed the market over the last decade and, over the last couple of years, the gap between its profits and those of the S&P 500—shown by the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in orange below, has grown wider: ADX Outperforms SPY ADX should trade at a premium for delivering these gains, yet it sports at an 11.4% discount as I write this. That means there’s upside as this “secret” income monster becomes more widely known. The move from growth to value, which we discussed with GAM above, should also help ADX move on to more people’s radar. At this point, you might be wondering which fund is ideal: the cheaper GAM or the higher-performing ADX? Ultimately, what matters with CEFs is that we combine the best funds in different asset classes—and funds with different investment strategies—while maintaining a high level of quality among our picks. That way, when one falters due to a selloff, you can rebalance toward that dip-buying opportunity as another CEF outperforms. CEFs are particularly useful for this kind of rebalancing due to their high dividends (yields average around 8% as I write this). You’ll not only compound your returns by following this approach—you’ll build up a healthy income stream over time, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

March 29, 2025 10:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from STRIDE, a phase 3b peripheral artery disease (PAD) outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly injectable Ozempic® (semaglutide 1.0 mg) in adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US1. These new data from the phase 3 trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the ACC and simultaneously published today in The Lancet2. The double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled STRIDE trial achieved its primary endpoint, with semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrating a superior and clinically meaningful improvement of 13% in maximum walking distance and a mean treatment difference of 39.9 meters on a steep incline, compared to placebo at week 52. The trial also demonstrated superiority to placebo for all confirmatory secondary outcomes assessed, including pain-free walking distance at week 52, health-related quality of life (Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6) at week 52, and maximum walking distance at week 571. “Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may cause severe symptoms, physical limitations, and a diminished quality of life, often making even short walks, such as retrieving the mail challenging. In individuals with PAD and diabetes, the disease can be even more severe, affecting small blood vessels and limiting the effectiveness of revascularization procedures and other treatments. Semaglutide 1.0 mg is the first medication in over two decades to show improvements in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as well as meaningful improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, which could address a critical unmet need for those with both PAD and type 2 diabetes," said Marc P. Bonaca, MD, Director of Vascular Research, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Lead Investigator of the STRIDE trial. “The significant improvements in walking distance and patient-reported quality of life observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg in the STRIDE trial are promising and represent an important step forward on the path to advancing treatment options for this patient population.” PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is under-screened and underdiagnosed and impacts approximately 230 million people globally3. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD, and nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. There are limited therapies available to specifically improve functional limitations in PAD, representing a significant unmet need in this population5. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The safety results from the STRIDE trial are consistent with the well-established safety and tolerability profile of once-weekly semaglutide1, supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient-years of exposure6. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (74 [19%] vs 78 [20%]). SAE probably related to treatment occurred in 2 participants (1%) in the semaglutide group and in 2 participants (1%) in the placebo group. SAE possibly related to treatment occurred in 3 (1%) and 4 (1%) participants, respectively. SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation of semaglutide or placebo were less common in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (11 [3%] vs 13 [3%]). SAEs led to the death of 3 (1%) and 8 (2%) participants in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively; however, no SAEs leading to death were treatment-related1. Based on data from the STRIDE clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Ozempic® to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision is anticipated in 2025. About STRIDE STRIDE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3b clinical trial assessing the benefit of once-weekly injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg, marketed as Ozempic®, on functional capacity. It enrolled 792 participants with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic PAD with walking-induced leg pain. The primary endpoint was maximum walking distance on a constant load treadmill for people treated with semaglutide compared to placebo at week 52. STRIDE is the only dedicated PAD functional outcomes trial with a GLP-1 RA. About PADLower extremity PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The classical symptom is intermittent claudication, associated with limited walking ability and poor health-related quality of life7. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD; nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. While anti-atherosclerotic therapies and lifestyle changes are recommended, there are no effective therapies to specifically improve functional outcomes in PAD and type 2 diabetes8. About Ozempic®Ozempic® (semaglutide) injection 0.25, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg is a once-weekly GLP-1 RA indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with known heart disease9,10. Ozempic® is currently marketed in 75 countries and 7 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Ozempic® worldwide11.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: AI: The New Aesthetics of Fascism
URL: https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/
Time Published: 2025-03-29T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
New Socialist. February 9, 2025 Gareth Watkins It's embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit: AI-generated art is the perfect aesthetic form for the far right. 15 min read Tommy Robinson tweets an image of soldiers walking into the ocean on D-Day. Britain First’s co-leader produces imagery of Muslim men laughing at sad white girls on public transport. An AI-generated song combining kitsch schlager pop with crude racial stereotypes makes it into the German top fifty and becomes number three on Spotify’s global viral chart. Benjamin Netanyahu conjures a vision of an ethnically-cleansed Gaza connected by bullet train to the equally ephemeral Neom. Keir Starmer’s Labour Party posts, then is forced to take down, a video of its policies as embodied by anthropomorphic animals. A few days later, they promised to “mainline AI into the veins” of Britain. The right loves AI-generated imagery. In a short time, a full half of the political spectrum has collectively fallen for the glossy, disturbing visuals created by generative AI. Despite its proponents having little love, or talent, for any form of artistic expression, right wing visual culture once ranged from memorable election-year posters to ‘terrorwave’. Today it is slop, almost totally. Why? To understand it, we must consider the right’s hatred of working people, its (more than) mutual embrace of the tech industry and, primarily, its profound rejection of Enlightenment humanism. The last might seem like a stretch, but bear with me. The first point is the most obvious. ‘AI’ – as embodied by large language models like ChatGPT, and largely diffusion-based image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney – promises to make anyone who can write a single-paragraph prompt into a copywriter or graphic designer; jobs generally associated with young, educated, urban, and often left-leaning workers. That even the best AI models are not fit to be used in any professional context is largely irrelevant. The selling point is that their users don’t have to pay (and, more importantly, interact with) a person who is felt to be beneath them, but upon whose technical skills they’d be forced to depend. For relatively small groups like Britain First, hiring a full-time graphic designer to keep up with its insatiable lust for images of crying soldiers and leering foreigners would clearly be an unjustifiable expense. But surely world leaders, capable of marshalling vast state resources, could afford at the very least to get someone from Fiverr? Then again, why would they do even that, when they could simply use AI, and thus signal to their base their utter contempt for labour? For its right wing adherents, the absence of humans is a feature, not a bug, of AI art. Where mechanically-produced art used to draw attention to its artificiality – think the mass-produced modernism of the Bauhaus (which the Nazis repressed and the AfD have condemned), or the music of Kraftwerk – AI art pretends to realism. It can produce art the way right wingers like it: Thomas Kinkade paintings, soulless Dreamworks 3D cartoons, depthless imagery that yields only the reading that its creator intended. And, vitally, it can do so without the need for artists. Javier Milei, a prodigious user of AI-generated art, wants Argentinians to know that any of them could join the 265,000, mostly young people who have lost jobs as a result of the recession that he induced, to the rapturous praise of economic elites. He wants to signal that anyone can find themselves at the wrong end of his chainsaw, even if doing so means producing laughably bad graphics for the consumption of his 5.9 million deeply uncritical Instagram followers. On the subject of Instagram, anyone old enough to read this will also be old enough to remember when Mark Zuckerberg, and by extension the rest of Silicon Valley, was broadly perceived as liberal. ‘Zuck’ was even touted as the only presidential candidate who could beat Donald Trump. (It’s worth noting that as Zuckerberg has drifted to the right he has also started dressing badly, a fact which we will return to later.) But even Zuck can’t make AI happen. The weird AI-powered fake profiles that Meta deployed in 2023 were quietly mothballed six months later, and would have disappeared from history completely, had Bluesky users not found some that had escaped deletion. This appears to be the fate of all commercial AI projects: at best, to be ignored but tolerated, when bundled with something that people actually need (cf: Microsoft’s Co-pilot); at worst, to fail entirely because the technology just isn’t there. Companies can’t launch a new AI venture without their customers telling them, clearly, “nobody wants this.” And yet they persist. Why? Class solidarity. The capitalist class, as a whole, has made a massive bet on AI: $1 trillion dollars, according to Goldman Sachs – a figure calculated before the Trump administration pledged a further $500 billion for its ‘Project Stargate’. While previous bets on the Metaverse and NFTs didn’t pay off, their bet on cryptocurrency has paid off spectacularly – $3.44 trillion dollars, at the time of writing, have been created, effectively out of thin air. All of the above technologies had heavy buy-in from the political right: Donald Trump co-signed an NFT project and a memecoin; the far-right, shut out of conventional banking, uses cryptocurrency almost exclusively. This isn’t just about utility, it’s about aligning themselves with the tech industry. The same is true of their adoption of AI. OpenAI is unable to make money on $200 subscriptions to ChatGPT. Goldman Sachs cannot see any justification for its level of investment. Sam Altman is subject to allegations of sexually abusing his sister. ‘Slop’ was very nearly word of the year. And then, to top it all off, the open-source DeepSeek project, developed in China, wiped $1 trillion off the US stock market overnight. In other words, the AI industry now finds that it needs all the allies it can get. And it can’t afford to be picky. If the only places that people are seeing AI imagery is @BasedEphebophile1488’s verified X account – well, at least it’s being used at all. The thinking seems to be that, if it can hang on long enough in the public consciousness, then, like cryptocurrency before it, AI will become ‘too big to fail’. Political actors like Tommy Robinson won’t be the ones to make that call, but they can normalise its use, and Robinson certainly moves in the digital circles of people who can offer the AI industry far more concrete help. Just as we might donate to a GoFundMe, the capitalist class will provide mutual aid in the form of billions in investment, adding AI to their products, and attempting to normalise AI by using it. This process of normalisation has led to the putatively centre-left Labour government pledging vast sums to AI infrastructure. If one of the key features of the Starmerite tendency is their belief that only conservative values are truly legitimate, their embrace of AI and its aesthetics may be part of this. We have seen how sensitive the tech industry’s leaders are to criticism. Marc Andreessen’s techno-optimist manifesto, when not conferring sainthood upon deeply evil figures like Nick Land, largely consists of its writer begging the world to love him. Mark Zuckerberg’s recent interview with Joe Rogan featured lengthy sections on how he does not feel validated by the press and governments. Just as when they reach out to ‘cancelled’ celebrities, the right is now proactively creating an alliance with the tech industry by communicating that, even if they can’t materially support companies like OpenAI, they can at least offer emotional support. We may all be good materialists, but we can’t underestimate the effects that non-material support has in creating networks within capital. No amount of normalisation and ‘validation’, however, can alter the fact that AI imagery looks like shit. But that, I want to argue, is its main draw to the right. If AI was capable of producing art that was formally competent, surprising, soulful, then they wouldn’t want it. They would be repelled by it. There was a time when reactionaries were able to create great art – Dostoyevsky, G.K Chesterton, Knut Hamsun, and so on – but that time has long passed. Decades of seething hatred of the humanities have left them unable to create, or even think about, art. Art has always been in a dialectical push and pull between tradition and the avant garde: ‘art is when there is a realistic picture of a landscape, or a scene from Greek mythology’ versus ‘a urinal can be art if an artist signs it’. The goal of the avant-garde, as their name suggests, has been to expand art’s territory, to show that Rothko’s expanses of colour, or Ono’s instructional paintings, can do what Vermeer’s portraits can, and do it just as well. There was even a time when the right partook in this, the Italian Futurists being a prime example. There were, at one point, writers like Céline and artists like Wyndham Lewis, who not only produced great work, but developed and pushed forward the avant-garde styles of their day. Are there any serious artists on the right today who do not parlay in nostalgia for some imagined time before art was ‘ruined’ by Jews, women, and homosexuals? Perhaps only Michel Houellebecq, and he is long past his two-book prime. Art has rules – like the rules of the physical universe they are sufficiently flexible to allow both Chopin and Merzbow to be classed as music, but they exist, and even internet memes are subject to those rules. The most burnt-out shitpost is still part of a long tradition of outsider sloganeering stretching back through 60s comix to Dada and Surrealism. They aren’t nothing, and if they’re ugly then, often, they’re ugly in an interesting, generative way. A person made them ugly, and did so with intent. No matter how deeply avant-garde art has engaged in shock and putative nihilism, no artist, to my knowledge, has ever made art with the sole aim of harming the already vulnerable. Even the most depraved Power Electronics acts or the most shocking performances of the Viennese Actionists had something more to them than simply causing suffering for its own sake. Andy Warhol’s mass-produced art did not create enjoyment by enabling its viewers to imagine their class enemies being made unemployed. Those are the goals of AI art, and that is why it resonates with the right. If art is the establishing or breaking of aesthetic rules, then AI art, as practiced by the right, says that there are no rules but the naked exercise of power by an in-group over an out-group. It says that the only way to enjoy art is in knowing that it is hurting somebody. That hurt can be direct, targeted at a particular group (like Britain First’s AI propaganda), or it can be directed at art itself, and by extension, anybody who thinks that art can have any kind of value. It can often be playful – in the way that the cruel children of literary cliché play at pulling the wings off flies – and ironised; Musk’s Nazi salute partook of a tradition of ironic-not-ironic appropriation of fascist iconography that winds its way through 4Chan (Musk’s touchpoint) and back into the countercultural far right of the 20th century. I would not be the first to observe that we are in a new phase of reaction, something probably best termed ‘postmodern conservatism’. The main effect of this shift has been to enshrine acting like a spoilt fifteen-year-old boy as the organising principle of the reactionary movement. Counter-enlightenment thought, going back to Burke and de Maistre, has been stripped of any pretence of being anything but a childish tantrum backed up by equally childish, playground-level bullying. It is, and has always been, “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas,” and to ‘post-liberal’ ‘intellectuals’, that is in fact a good thing – if anything, they believe, the postmodern right needs to become more absurd; it needs to abandon Enlightenment ideals like reason and argumentation altogether.1 The right wing intellectual project is simply to ask: ‘what would have to be true in order to justify the terrible things that I want to do?’ The right wing aesthetic project is to flood the zone – unsurprisingly, given their scatological bent, with bullshit – in order to erode the intellectual foundations for resisting political cruelty. Truth does not set you free. Once you know that 2+2=4, that the administrative capital of the Netherlands is The Hague and not Amsterdam, or that immigration is a net economic positive for Britain, then you are forever bound to that truth. Your world has become, in some respects, smaller, your options diminished. If it would be more enjoyable – because this is, at the end of the day, about enjoyment – to create your own truth then you are out of luck. Combine truths with a concern for human life and thriving, and suddenly rules start to proliferate: we have established the truth that heating milk reduces the bacteria and viruses in it that can harm human beings, which is undesirable to us, therefore we must heat all milk that is sold. A lot of people are fine with this, accepting small impositions on their freedom in the name of the greater freedom from disease. Some are not. There is no reason, of course, that any rule made in the name of Enlightenment humanism should be necessarily good: liberal politics, Labour’s current mania for austerity, or the interminable justifications for the Iraq war, are often framed as being based on reason and humanism while being anything but. If you’ve been subject to computer-says-no rules governing your access to the basic necessities of life, then you’ll know how easy it is to disguise arbitrary and highly politicised whims as laws of nature, as ironclad as A = π r². The application of rationality and compassion in the real world brings to mind the (likely apocryphal) Ghandi quote about Western civilisation: “I think it would be a good idea.” The right is a libidinal formation; it is, for many of its proponents, especially those who aren’t wealthy enough to materially benefit from it, a structure in which to have fun. A hobby, almost. Sartre’s injunction to remember that antisemites are primarily “amusing themselves”2 is true of most – perhaps all – right wing discourse, no matter how serious it seems or how terrible its real-world effects. As such, the right are strongly averse to any sort of reality-testing. It is, to them, beside the point whether anything they say stands up to the tests developed by the sciences and humanities, including those which determine (insofar as such a determination can be made) whether a piece of art is ‘good’, or at least serious. When they do invoke objectivity, it is misplaced, and as deeply naïve as their artistic output, premising their objection to the existence of trans people on ‘basic biology’, when not only can biology not define ‘woman’, it is having difficulty deciding what a fish or vegetable is. Serious engagement with the world as it is – with the facts that emphatically don’t care about your feelings – doesn’t often, if ever, yield the simple explanations that the right require. In the face of this complexity, most people will conclude that it is best to be humble: What is a woman? No idea, don’t really care, but let’s act in a way that causes the least suffering. But the right seem incapable of doing this. Despite all their absurdist posturing, they struggle to come to terms with a contradictory world that does not conform to their pre-decided categories. They want to assert, simultaneously, that unambiguous laws govern all aspects of being, while acting as though ‘truth’ is whatever they want or need it to be at any given moment. Gender revanchism is one of the main organising principles of the postmodern right, and much everyday AI usage demonstrates a particularly gendered form of cruelty: deepfake nudes, AI ‘girlfriends’ used as a rhetorical cudgel to show real women that they are being replaced, AI ‘art’ of Taylor Swift being sexually assaulted. It’s no coincidence that the internet’s largest directory of deepfakes uses Donald Trump as a mascot. These attitudes are reflected in the upper echelons of the tech and AI industry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman – the man we are being told is a generational talent, a revolutionary, on a par with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates – is also, allegedly, a rapist and paedophile, who considered his own sister his sexual property since she was three years old, and who responded to allegations by lamenting that “caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult.” A love of sexual violence is a key part of the identity of the contemporary right, and it is no coincidence that, the further right one goes, the more likely one is to encounter open celebration of rape and, particularly, paedophilia. Altman’s legal trouble will, for many on the right, only confirm that he is one of them. Meanwhile, on the Joe Rogan podcast, Mark Zuckerberg described the tech industry as “culturally neutered” and called for more “masculine energy” and “aggression”. Let’s return to Zuckerberg’s clothing. It was he that established the ubiquitous ‘grey hoodie’ style for tech CEOs. But recently he has begun to exhibit a new style. Oversized t-shirts emblazoned with ‘It’s either Zuck or Nothing’ in Latin, the unwieldy lines of his Meta AI glasses, a gaudy and unnecessary gold chain. This isn’t taking risks with fashion, like Rick Owens or Vivienne Westwood. It’s just ugly and stupid. Zuckerberg is also significantly more muscular than he used to be, despite doing nothing in his life that would seem to require a bodybuilder physique. I don’t think that it’s a coincidence that, as he embraces corporate incelism and AI, he has felt liberated to ignore what does and doesn’t look good, choosing instead to display that he is wealthy and powerful enough to look terrible if he wants. All the emperor has to do, when the child laughs at his nudity, is ignore them. Trump’s haircut, which we all seem to have become inured to, serves the same purpose. It looks like shit and that’s the point. It is a display of power and a small act of cruelty. AI is a cruel technology. It replaces workers, devours millions of gallons of water, vomits CO2 into the atmosphere, propagandises exclusively for the worst ideologies, and fills the world with more ugliness and stupidity. Cruelty is the central tenet of right wing ideology. It is at the heart of everything they do. They are now quite willing to lose money or their lives in order to make the world a crueller place, and AI is a part of this – a mad rush to make a machine god that will liberate capital from labour for good. (This is no exaggeration: there is a lineage from OpenAI’s senior management back to the Lesswrong blog, originator of the concept of Roko’s Basilisk.) Moreso even than cryptocurrency, AI is entirely nihilistic, with zero redeeming qualities. It is a blight upon the world, and it will take decades to clear up the mountains of slop it has generated in the past two or three years. AI is, unfortunately, a fever that will have to burn itself out. It may be the case that, like cryptocurrency, elites are simply so invested in this technology that, despite its total lack of utility, they will keep trying to make it happen. Given how great a fit it is for them psychologically, I would say that this is more likely to happen than not. However, as we saw in those two brief weeks of last year’s US election campaign, the right wing psyche is incredibly fragile. For some reason, they are able to process any inversion of empirical reality, but are acutely sensitive to being laughed at. Calling them weird absolutely works, and telling them their sole artistic output looks like shit also works. Laughing at people who treat AI art as in any way legitimate works. Talking about AI’s environmental impact or its implications for the workforce will not work - they like that, it makes them feel dangerous. Instead of talking about taking money from artists, talk about how it makes them look cheap. If hurting and offending people is part of the point, then we can take that fun away from them by refusing to express hurt or offence, even if we feel it. Technological progress isn’t linear, and it’s not wholly undemocratic. We, ordinary people, stopped Google Glass from being widely released because we mocked its users, calling them ‘glassholes’. The Cybertruck – itself a work of anti-art that could only be the product of a mind addled by the far right – failed, largely because it is embarrassing to be seen in one. We have already seen that the AI industry is vulnerable – it was possible for Chinese grad students to build the same thing for a fraction of the price, calling into question the entire model of growth through massive investment in data centres. The left is powerless across much of society, but a training in ruthless criticism of all that exists has made us masters of negativity, while always keeping one eye on the better world that is possible when the slop has been cleared away. Our most effective weapons against AI, and the right wing that has adopted it, may not be strikes, boycotts or the power of dialectics. They might be replying “cringe,” “this sucks,” and “this looks like shit.” There are, of course, important left critiques of those values, and of the European Enlightenment project itself. These are not the same as the revanchism of the right. ↩ Jean-Paul Sartre. [1948] 1995. Anti-Semite and Jew. Translated by George J Becker. New York: Schocken, p.20.

According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company’s overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion. Though its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk’s purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 Already the head of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, Musk launched xAI in July 2023, a year after purchasing Twitter. While he said the goal of xAI was to “understand reality,” an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X Friday. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.” Calling X “the digital town square,” Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users. Bluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk’s takeover. At the same time, bolstered by its connections to Facebook and Instagram, Threads had over 320 million monthly active users as of February 2025. Musk made headlines in July of last year when it was revealed that Grok would be trained on X user data. The setting can be disabled, but is on by default for user accounts. Some social media users jeered today’s announcement, mocking the apparently sizable valuation boost in a deal between two of Musk's own companies. “I also sold my 2008 Honda Accord to myself for $1 million,” New York Times tech reporter Ryan Mac said on Bluesky. “Wait a min…what’s different though… other than on paper?” an X user asked. Congratulations to @elonmusk on xAI's acquisition of X. Not even we could have predicted this! pic.twitter.com/6d0ao7h3ci — Polymarket (@Polymarket) March 28, 2025 The merger, however, could serve a more pragmatic purpose. With X still carrying significant debt—$12 billion, according to Musk's tweet—folding it into the xAI umbrella could give the company access to new investors, improved valuation, and a narrative pivot away from Twitter’s chaotic takeover. “This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress,” he said.

March 28, 2025 18:07 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: CoreWeave Cofounder Discusses Cloud AI Firm’s IPO, Biggest Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2025/03/28/coreweave-cofounder-cloud-computing-ai-firms-ipo-biggest-mcbee-intrator-venturo/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T21:52:09Z
Full Content:
ByPhoebe Liu ByPhoebe Liu, Forbes Staff. CoreWeave cofounders Brian Venturo (chief strategy officer), Michael Intrator (CEO) and Brannin McBee (chief development officer), from left to right. CoreWeave made its public market debut on Friday with the first big IPO of 2025. The company, which rents cloud computing power to customers that need it for AI applications, exploded onto the scene over the last couple of years. On Friday, its stock closed around $40 per share, the same as its pricing and slightly above its opening $39 per share—implying a valuation of $23 billion on a fully diluted basis (accounting for outstanding options and restricted stock). “God, like, what a crazy thing to accomplish. I’ve been shoulder to shoulder with some of the most amazing people on the planet executing for the last seven years,” gushed cofounder and Chief Development Officer Brannin McBee in an interview with Forbes on Friday. “At the same time, it’s the quintessential ‘this is the beginning’ statement. … it’s just another day at CoreWeave.” In one way it was: the cloud computing company, which initially aimed to raise between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion ended up pricing its shares at $40, well below its target of $47 to $55. As such, the company raised less money ($1.5 billion) and at a lower valuation than they’d aimed for, per documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact its valuation of $23 billion is almost exactly what it was when it sold shares in a private transaction in October 2024, according to the company’s initial public offering prospectus filed in early March. It was based on that information that Forbes declared the three founders and one board member all billionaires in early March. CEO Michael Intrator, Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo and McBee own 11%, 7% and 5% of CoreWeave’s shares, respectively, while board member Jack Cogen owns 4%. After factoring in the stock they sold while CoreWeave was still a private company, Forbes estimates that Intrator is now worth $2.7 billion, Venturo is worth $1.7 billion, McBee is worth $1.3 billion, and Cogen is worth $1 billion; those net worths are actually down more than 10% apiece than when we first estimated their fortunes, due to the lower pricing. A spokesperson for CoreWeave did not respond to a request for comment on the cofounders’ net worths. “I think we raised exactly what we needed for the business,” McBee says. “Pricing discovery is hard. Pricing discovery is harder in market volatility. But what you’re looking at today is a business with immense value and immense investor interest.” CoreWeave is in many ways a poster child of the exponentially growing appetite for computing power for the AI boom. In 2017, the then-commodity traders Intrator, Venturo and McBee started Atlantic Crypto, using Nvidia chips they’d stockpiled to mine cryptocurrency. Two years later, they renamed it CoreWeave and shifted the business model to building data centers and selling computing power to companies that didn’t have enough of their own GPU servers–storage systems comprised of electronic circuits called graphics processing units. After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022 and unleashed something of an AI firestorm, CoreWeave’s customers were, increasingly, AI companies. Now, according to the company’s new filing, CoreWeave’s biggest customers are Microsoft, IBM, Meta, NVIDIA and billion-dollar AI labs Cohere and Mistral. Still, investors expressed concerns about CoreWeave’s dependence on these large customers (with $10-billion-plus, multi-year deals with OpenAI and Microsoft; the latter generated more than 60% of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue), heavy net losses ($860 million on $1.92 billion in revenue in 2024) and debt-reliant financing. The OpenAI deal, a $12 billion contract announced on March 10, complements OpenAI’s “commercial deals with Microsoft and Oracle, and our joint venture with Softbank on Stargate,” CEO Sam Altman wrote in a press release—referring to a $500 billion partnership aiming to secure American AI supremacy. McBee isn’t worried. “It’s a bit of a self-reinforcing mechanism,” he says. “If we’re helping the biggest companies grow, they’re just going to get bigger.” Between glances out the window, he adds that CoreWeave plans to target slightly smaller customers to diversify their customer base. On CoreWeave’s path to profitability, McBee is confident that the company’s contracts will pay off infrastructure costs in less than three years. Also up in the air, of course, is whether demand will continue to grow. It’s expensive to build data centers, and CoreWeave has 32 of them running more than 250,000 GPUs as of the end of 2024—and plans to continue expanding long-term. CoreWeave is certainly betting that it will. In late 2024, for example, CoreWeave signed a 15-year, $4.5 billion agreement with crypto company Galaxy to lease their data center in west Texas. Regardless of where CoreWeave’s share price ends up, the cofounders have nothing to worry about—financially speaking. They have cashed out more than the typical pre-IPO founder does: the three cofounders and Cogen each sold more than $150 million of CoreWeave’s shares (before taxes) as part of private market sales in 2023 and 2024. McBee says the cofounders intend to stay at CoreWeave for the foreseeable future. “We are the long-term management team,” he says. “We have so much to build.”

Tesla’s (TSLA+3.90%) status as the “winner” of President Donald Trump’s new auto tariffs didn’t protect it from a tech-led market selloff on Friday, as the stock followed Nvidia (NVDA+0.94%) and the rest of the Magnificent 7 lower after new economic numbers pointed toward the possibility of stagflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7%, the S&P 500 declined 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average shed 715.8 points, or 1.7%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.36%) led the Mag 7 lower, plunging 4.9%, Amazon’s (AMZN+2.48%) stock fell 4.3%, Tesla slid 3.5%, and Nvidia eased 1.6%. The personal consumption report for February released Friday showed the core PCE deflator — the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation measure — heating up while real household spending weakened. That creates a situation where the Fed is torn between curtailing price gains and supporting growth. “Today’s report highlights the difficult predicament the Fed is now confronting,” Citigroup (C+1.47%) economists wrote. “Ultimately, we expect Fed officials to dovishly lean toward their full-employment mandate, but that would depend on upcoming data and in particular on ... March spending and inflation.” Trump’s trade war is also weighing on investors. The 25% tariffs on all car, truck, and auto part imports that the president announced Wednesday evening continued to depress automakers’ stocks Friday, with Stellantis (STLA+0.45%) dropping 4.1%, Ford (F+3.17%) down 2%, and General Motors (GM+1.71%) off 1.1%. The ADRs of Toyota (TM+2.02%), Volkswagen (VWAGY+1.07%) and Honda (HMC+1.88%) also declined. Separately, Lululemon’s (LULU+2.26%) stock plunged 14% after the athleisure wear maker’s sales and profit projections missed analyst expectations. The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI+0.46%) reported. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to the auto tariffs, which were more hawkish than he’d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers will probably wait longer to see the impact of Trump’s tariffs, especially on inflation, before making any decision on cutting rates, Grisanti told Quartz. “The only way I see Trump getting the Fed on his side is if he tanks the economy,” Grisanti said. “We can slice and dice these economic numbers as much as we want, but the Fed is on hold until we get some tariff clarity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares in CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), ended their market debut flat following a $1.5 billion initial public offering that priced below its expected range. Shares of CoreWeave opened at $39 Friday. It ended the day at $40, its IPO price, trading as high as almost $42 and as low as around $37.50. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave, which makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, had also cut the deal's size, selling 37.5 million shares, fewer than the 49 million previously anticipated. Data centers are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company, which relies on Microsoft (MSFT) for a large portion of its sales, also depends on Nvidia chips for its business. The IPO was the largest by a tech firm in the U.S. since the $5.2 billion offering by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) in September 2023, according to Dealogic, and the largest in the U.S. since the $1.75 billion listing by LNG exporter Venture Global in January.

Title: Hollywood’s Studio Leasing Problem Is Much Worse Than You Think

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy You don’t need to study Hollywood’s golden ages or sift through decades of box office numbers to see there are major problems in Tinseltown that have forced an existential crisis on the entertainment capital of the world. Anyone around just a few years ago during the feverish Streaming Wars can see how quickly show business has descended into a dismal scene. Now — more than a year after the end of the historic labor strikes that shut down the filming industry, and long after people forgot about social distancing — half the film and TV production stages in Los Angeles are said to be empty. The Otis College Report on the Creative Economy released March 27 found that, compared to the peak in 2022, the number of shooting days in L.A. County was down 42 percent in 2024. And analysts estimate Southern California’s production levels are a staggering 50 to 70 percent below their peak just six years ago. The declining level of filming activity and rising industry unemployment numbers are more than alarming, particularly as the region wrestles with a high cost of living and economic uncertainties. And all these challenges were evident and insurmountable in many cases even before the region was hit by historically devastating wildfires in January. This is not necessarily from a lack of demand for new content, either. “California is not the first, second, third, fourth or fifth choice for filming at the moment,” said Sam Nicassio, president of Los Angeles Center Studios. The entertainment industry’s distribution and marketing sectors are likely to remain in L.A. over the long term, but stakeholders say Hollywood is in serious danger of losing its claim as the best place to make movies and television. Jason Hariton — chief studio and real estate officer at MBS Group, the operator affiliate of the biggest owner of content creation space in the world, Hackman Capital Partners — said L.A. is not competitive in terms of attracting new high-end film production. “It’s not even on the list in terms of being competitive with those other major markets,” he said. Oh, how quickly we forget. Very recently, companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook were racing to spend as much money as they could to build up their content libraries. They edged their way into Hollywood to compete for eyeballs, and for creative real estate, with the likes of Disney, Warner Bros., Fox, Paramount and Sony — who were themselves also racing to establish their own streaming platforms. Netflix, the era’s darling, led the new wave after moving its L.A. base to Hollywood and master-leasing as much studio space as it could while also declaring it didn’t care about other states’ tax incentives. Netflix’s executives made it clear they were betting on California. As leasing rates grew with viewer subscriptions, studios and their new streaming divisions similarly told developers that if they built more soundstages, they would lease them. That led to this story’s apparent climax when an asset management firm by the name of Blackstone (BX) came to Hollywood in 2020 to break into show business. The real estate company bought a 49 percent stake in Hudson Pacific Properties’ 2.2 million-square-foot portfolio of soundstages and Class A office space — all in Hollywood proper — and partnered with the L.A.-based real estate investment trust to expand the portfolio with new soundstage development in Southern California. Netflix is the portfolio’s largest tenant, leasing 700,000 square feet of the office space on Sunset Boulevard. The move from an asset management titan like Blackstone — which was not traditionally involved in show business real estate — unofficially led to the incredible surge of new outside investors showing up at L.A. City Hall with plans to build soundstages to take advantage of the massive content creation budgets coming out of Hollywood. But that was before the historic writers and actors strikes in 2023. Hollywood has survived many challenges — from the world wars and the Red Scare to a global pandemic. It’s even been through past “runaway production” scares in the 1980s and 1990s, when some studios sent crews to Canada to take advantage of its new tax incentives. Coming out of COVID, there was a record amount of production activity in every market because there was so much pent-up demand and streamers coming online. But, this time, it’s different. After the strikes ended, it didn’t open the floodgates in the same way it did after COVID restrictions were lifted. “I think there was hope that, in January 2024 — bam — we’re all gonna be back in business,” said Nicole Mihalka, vice president at CBRE’s Downtown L.A. office. “But we were slower to ramp up, mostly because all the projects that had been previously greenlit, that were put on hold, needed to be reactivated.” Hariton said there is no instant on/off switch this time. “It’s been incredibly challenging in Greater Los Angeles and in California in terms of production activity,” Hariton said. Leading up to the strikes, it became clear that having subscribers alone wasn’t going to cover the billions spent each year on production. In response, companies cut their budgets and headcounts significantly. That made worse the latest wave of projects being pushed elsewhere. The Otis report also found that there are still 25 percent fewer film and TV jobs in the state than in 2022. Only 26 percent of the jobs lost during the strikes have been recovered, “underscoring the lingering impact of an industry in transition.” That transition also includes rising competition from user-generated content. Studios now find themselves competing for viewers, not only among each other, but also with YouTube and other online platforms that showcase content by amateurs filming in backyards or basements. To see that Hollywood didn’t fully recover from the double labor strikes throughout 2024 has struck fear in stakeholders and investors in the future viability of having so much studio space. Even worse, Netflix is considering leaving those same office buildings on Sunset Boulevard that were part of the landmark Blackstone recapitalization. The streaming giant is thinking of relocating from those buildings, which is more crushing considering the same company has been busy opening new stages in New Jersey, Brooklyn, the United Kingdom and other markets outside California. Hudson Pacific, one of the largest studio developers and Netflix’s favorite landlord, suffered similarly during the strikes, and the REIT’s stock price has fallen 92 percent since its record high five years ago. The development firm has also canceled plans for a new studio development outside of London. “Looking ahead, the film, TV and sound sector appears to be settling into a ‘new normal,’ characterized by lower employment and production levels compared to its pre-strike peak,” according to the Otis report. That new normal could be difficult to accept. But, indeed, a recent report from ProdPro, which surveyed crew members, executives and suppliers on the outlook for 2025 and 2026, showed that none of the top five preferred filming locations was in the U.S. Ghost lights L.A. Center Studios’ Nicassio said he tracks utilization at about 300 soundstages in Southern California, and half are empty right now because global film production is much lower than a couple of years ago, while there’s also far, far more available production space than ever before. “There are 85 jurisdictions in the world right now that have film and TV tax credit incentives, and that number grows,” he said, adding that many other markets have more favorable programs than California’s. Hariton is the fourth generation of his family working in the L.A. entertainment industry, and he previously oversaw global production operations for Netflix. Speaking from his office at the Radford Studio Center, he said it was until recently one of the busiest locations in Hollywood. “You could never get a stage at Radford,” he said. “Our occupancy now is higher than the competition, but we’re at the lowest occupancy that we can ever remember.” He said filming and entertainment is at an inflection point because it has become a worldwide business. In the 1980s and 1990s, some productions left Hollywood for newer, secondary markets like Canada to save money. But it would entail bringing an American crew with them. “Now the entire business is global,” Hariton said. “You can shoot the largest of tentpole films in the likes of a London or a Sydney, or Budapest even. And there’s 100 percent local crew. Canada has a very robust and talented crew base, and so do a lot of locations in Eastern Europe and London. “A television series that moved because of the strikes, it’s not like they’re going to come back in the next season [of the show].” In the past few years, massive billion-dollar studio campuses have sprouted in places like Las Vegas, New York and Nashville, offering better tax incentives, as well as a generally lower cost of living for workers. (To take a recent example: A former military base in Monmouth, N.J., is currently preparing itself to be a 289-acre, $903 million Netflix campus. Or, last week, Innovo Property Group opened a ground-up, purpose-built studio with 274,283 square feet of production and support space and 70,351 square feet of office space in Long Island City, managed by MBS Group.) Last summer, FilmLA — a nonprofit that tracks production activity and shoot days in Southern California — found that of all production activity in L.A., only 3 percent of that activity was related to feature films. “The majority of tentpole film productions do not shoot in Los Angeles,” Hariton said. However, a separate Otis report from last summer found that other markets are struggling with occupancy and demand as well, and that no one market is taking the title from L.A. “Right now we’re in a state of contraction,” Mihalka said. “And so there is excess supply in all markets, not just Los Angeles.” Indeed — when California increased its tax incentive program to its current level a decade ago, Georgia and its 30 percent tax incentive was the top new alternative market luring productions away from Hollywood. But, last year, Georgia studio owners (not named Tyler Perry) started reporting spikes in vacancy rates and their own oversaturation. New York City is another market that saw a rush for studio development the past several years, but last summer the city started facing that same problem of getting people on set. The more recent Otis report also found that employment in California’s creative economy contracted by 0.9 percent during the past year, and was 7.1 percent below the pre-pandemic peak. At the same time, the number of jobs across the remainder of the state’s economy grew by 2.3 percent during the same period. “[California’s] entertainment employment is still below its 2022 peak and may not bounce back soon,” the report said. The loss of production jobs then affects other sectors, including post production, visual effects and music. In February, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation reported that every dollar spent on California’s Film and Television Tax Credit generates $24.40 in economic activity, $16.14 in GDP and $8.60 in wages. “L.A. was the behemoth for all of those components — now, not for any of the components,” Hariton said. “The majority of your high-end TV and film projects are not shooting in L.A., and those have the highest amount of crew.” ‘Incentives chasing incentives’ Last year, 71 percent of projects recently unable to secure tax credits in California opted to film elsewhere, according to the governor’s office. To address the problem and make California more competitive, lawmakers this summer want to boost California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program allocation to $750 million per year, well over double the current annual cap of $330 million. That would make it the highest of any state with a capped tax incentive program. New York currently has the highest mark in the U.S. with an annual cap of $700 million, while Illinois and Georgia, which have been popular alternatives for productions the past decade, don’t have a cap at all. But it might not be so easy. California’s base production limit is generally set at 20 percent. But film producers quickly point out the state’s effective limit is a 12 to 13 percent tax incentive because California’s limits which parts of a production qualify, while other markets have that allotment set at 30 percent. Lawmakers on March 24 introduced a revised version that boosts the credit to 35 percent, with an additional 5 percent available for projects outside of L.A., and expands the category of productions that qualify. “The program right now, in its current form, [has] a structural problem,” Hariton said. “[It] needs to be amended to actually be competitive and to be able to properly utilize the $750 million. Increasing the program is wonderful, but it would be all for naught if the program itself wasn’t competitive.” Further, some markets like those in the United Kingdom allow tax breaks for a lot more or even all “above the line” budget items — referring to key creative roles in a production such as directors, screenwriters, key cast members and visual effects. Some even cover residuals for actors, which can be a massive expense for a large-scale production with A-list actors. “It’s not about L.A. versus Atlanta,” Hariton said. “It’s actually about L.A. having a seat at the table. … It’s still not going to be as good as the other international, competitive locations.” The revised tax incentive introduced March 24 does not mention above-the-line costs, which Nicassio said would be an important addition. But he’s worried it could be jurisdictions racing to the bottom. “You have to be careful when increasing the tax credit, or it could turn into incentives chasing incentives,” he said. Cut! The expansion of so many secondary markets — coupled with the number of empty stages — make the current pipeline of soundstage development in Los Angeles utterly overwhelming, if not laughably impossible. That pipeline will need to adjust to the slowdown to not oversaturate the market and further weaken the supply-demand balance. “I think all the [companies with soundstage development] plans that can evaluate are re-evaluating the current status,” Hariton said. “Some have already announced that they’re canceling some big projects. “I think it’s a very concerning time from a studio infrastructure development point. Because right now the demand is not great enough to serve the current supply.” Particularly in California, home to perhaps the nation’s most difficult path to securing entitlements, real estate development is lagging years behind the trends (which is partly why Netflix wanted as many master leases as it could get a decade ago because it was far easier and effective than building the soundstages it needed). Hollywood isn’t giving up, however. Mihalka said there were real signs of leasing life in the second half of last year, and data for February showed improvements over the same month last year. She also said more production companies are looking at office space on studio lots, and she expects a ramp-up in activity throughout the industry this year. “[Those office leases] tells me that definitely production-related and entertainment companies, they want to stay here in L.A., particularly in the core TMZ,” she said, referring to the entertainment industry’s geographic core. “First, we’ve got the office and the groups planning the productions as you see the writers rooms requirements start up again. Then you see the production and the stage activity.” The Otis report found that California is still home to 35 percent of the nation’s film, TV and sound employment, and the state remains the national leader of the creative economy. “Los Angeles continues to be the executive and creative hub of the global screen industry, retaining a concentration of high-wage, highly skilled jobs,” the report read. “However, the cost-sensitive nature of some production means that some projects — particularly those that do not require access to California’s state-of-the-art studios and specialized workforce — will continue to be filmed elsewhere.” CBRE’s Mihalka said show business is always going to hinge on California. “Do I think that Hollywood’s moving to Texas? Absolutely not,” she said. “Especially with the activity that I’m seeing today.” There’s also hope because Hollywood isn’t new to the game, and it’s not the only market facing industry-wide issues. L.A. can fall back on its institutional pull for the creative industry, whereas other markets don’t have the history to fall back on. “The infrastructure is still here,” Nicassio said. “The industry still wants to be here. Your writers, your high-end talent — they still want to be in Southern California. So you couple it all together [with the new tax credit plan], and that’s what we’re putting our hopes on.” Similarly, Hariton said a genuine desire to film in California exists inherently. “If the programmatic changes are made to be competitive, along with the increases,” he said, “then we will see a meaningful and quick recovery.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

Last summer, FilmLA — a nonprofit that tracks production activity and shoot days in Southern California — found that of all production activity in L.A., only 3 percent of that activity was related to feature films. “The majority of tentpole film productions do not shoot in Los Angeles,” Hariton said. However, a separate Otis report from last summer found that other markets are struggling with occupancy and demand as well, and that no one market is taking the title from L.A. “Right now we’re in a state of contraction,” Mihalka said. “And so there is excess supply in all markets, not just Los Angeles.” Indeed — when California increased its tax incentive program to its current level a decade ago, Georgia and its 30 percent tax incentive was the top new alternative market luring productions away from Hollywood. But, last year, Georgia studio owners (not named Tyler Perry) started reporting spikes in vacancy rates and their own oversaturation. New York City is another market that saw a rush for studio development the past several years, but last summer the city started facing that same problem of getting people on set. The more recent Otis report also found that employment in California’s creative economy contracted by 0.9 percent during the past year, and was 7.1 percent below the pre-pandemic peak. At the same time, the number of jobs across the remainder of the state’s economy grew by 2.3 percent during the same period. “[California’s] entertainment employment is still below its 2022 peak and may not bounce back soon,” the report said. The loss of production jobs then affects other sectors, including post production, visual effects and music. In February, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation reported that every dollar spent on California’s Film and Television Tax Credit generates $24.40 in economic activity, $16.14 in GDP and $8.60 in wages. “L.A. was the behemoth for all of those components — now, not for any of the components,” Hariton said. “The majority of your high-end TV and film projects are not shooting in L.A., and those have the highest amount of crew.” ‘Incentives chasing incentives’ Last year, 71 percent of projects recently unable to secure tax credits in California opted to film elsewhere, according to the governor’s office. To address the problem and make California more competitive, lawmakers this summer want to boost California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program allocation to $750 million per year, well over double the current annual cap of $330 million. That would make it the highest of any state with a capped tax incentive program. New York currently has the highest mark in the U.S. with an annual cap of $700 million, while Illinois and Georgia, which have been popular alternatives for productions the past decade, don’t have a cap at all. But it might not be so easy. California’s base production limit is generally set at 20 percent. But film producers quickly point out the state’s effective limit is a 12 to 13 percent tax incentive because California’s limits which parts of a production qualify, while other markets have that allotment set at 30 percent. Lawmakers on March 24 introduced a revised version that boosts the credit to 35 percent, with an additional 5 percent available for projects outside of L.A., and expands the category of productions that qualify. “The program right now, in its current form, [has] a structural problem,” Hariton said. “[It] needs to be amended to actually be competitive and to be able to properly utilize the $750 million. Increasing the program is wonderful, but it would be all for naught if the program itself wasn’t competitive.” Further, some markets like those in the United Kingdom allow tax breaks for a lot more or even all “above the line” budget items — referring to key creative roles in a production such as directors, screenwriters, key cast members and visual effects. Some even cover residuals for actors, which can be a massive expense for a large-scale production with A-list actors. “It’s not about L.A. versus Atlanta,” Hariton said. “It’s actually about L.A. having a seat at the table. … It’s still not going to be as good as the other international, competitive locations.” The revised tax incentive introduced March 24 does not mention above-the-line costs, which Nicassio said would be an important addition. But he’s worried it could be jurisdictions racing to the bottom. “You have to be careful when increasing the tax credit, or it could turn into incentives chasing incentives,” he said. Cut! The expansion of so many secondary markets — coupled with the number of empty stages — make the current pipeline of soundstage development in Los Angeles utterly overwhelming, if not laughably impossible. That pipeline will need to adjust to the slowdown to not oversaturate the market and further weaken the supply-demand balance. “I think all the [companies with soundstage development] plans that can evaluate are re-evaluating the current status,” Hariton said. “Some have already announced that they’re canceling some big projects. “I think it’s a very concerning time from a studio infrastructure development point. Because right now the demand is not great enough to serve the current supply.” Particularly in California, home to perhaps the nation’s most difficult path to securing entitlements, real estate development is lagging years behind the trends (which is partly why Netflix wanted as many master leases as it could get a decade ago because it was far easier and effective than building the soundstages it needed). Hollywood isn’t giving up, however. Mihalka said there were real signs of leasing life in the second half of last year, and data for February showed improvements over the same month last year. She also said more production companies are looking at office space on studio lots, and she expects a ramp-up in activity throughout the industry this year. “[Those office leases] tells me that definitely production-related and entertainment companies, they want to stay here in L.A., particularly in the core TMZ,” she said, referring to the entertainment industry’s geographic core. “First, we’ve got the office and the groups planning the productions as you see the writers rooms requirements start up again. Then you see the production and the stage activity.” The Otis report found that California is still home to 35 percent of the nation’s film, TV and sound employment, and the state remains the national leader of the creative economy. “Los Angeles continues to be the executive and creative hub of the global screen industry, retaining a concentration of high-wage, highly skilled jobs,” the report read. “However, the cost-sensitive nature of some production means that some projects — particularly those that do not require access to California’s state-of-the-art studios and specialized workforce — will continue to be filmed elsewhere.” CBRE’s Mihalka said show business is always going to hinge on California. “Do I think that Hollywood’s moving to Texas? Absolutely not,” she said. “Especially with the activity that I’m seeing today.” There’s also hope because Hollywood isn’t new to the game, and it’s not the only market facing industry-wide issues. L.A. can fall back on its institutional pull for the creative industry, whereas other markets don’t have the history to fall back on. “The infrastructure is still here,” Nicassio said. “The industry still wants to be here. Your writers, your high-end talent — they still want to be in Southern California. So you couple it all together [with the new tax credit plan], and that’s what we’re putting our hopes on.” Similarly, Hariton said a genuine desire to film in California exists inherently. “If the programmatic changes are made to be competitive, along with the increases,” he said, “then we will see a meaningful and quick recovery.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The gaming retailer paid nearly $270,000 last year for Ryan Cohen’s executive security, while the toy company laid off 120 workers at its headquarters. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From H&M’s Q1 store closures to Michelle Obama and Steph Curry partnering on a sports hydration drink, here’s our closeout for the week. Williams-Sonoma keeps it 500 Home retailer Williams-Sonoma on Monday announced the company’s inclusion in the S&P 500. “Being included in the S&P 500 is a significant milestone that acknowledges the power of our brand portfolio and growth strategies,” CEO Laura Alber said in a statement. “We remain committed to driving innovation, delivering exceptional products and experiences to our customers, and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.” The company’s portfolio includes its namesake brand, Williams Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark & Graham and GreenRow. Weaker gross margin hurts H&M’s profitability in Q1 H&M on Thursday reported first-quarter net sales increased 3% year over year to 55.3 billion Swedish Krona (about $5.5 billion). The company’s profitability during Q1 was negatively impacted by weaker gross margin that was affected by increased markdowns, customer investments and external factors, according to an earnings announcement. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 51.5% last year. CEO Daniel Ervér said it continued to “optimise the store portfolio” through store closures, 40 net of which shuttered during the quarter. “Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” Ervér said in a statement. Sally Beauty partners with Uber Eats Sally Beauty entered the Uber Eats platform on Tuesday, making its products available for delivery nationwide. This is Uber Eats first national beauty partnership and, to honor it, customers can get half off purchases $50 or more through March 31. “Being the first beauty retailer to partner with Uber Eats allows us to take convenience to the next level, further expanding our same-day delivery reach nationwide, making our quality products more accessible than ever before,” Natalie Lockhart, group vice president of strategy, customer insights and digital experience at Sally Beauty Holdings, said in a statement. Michelle Obama, Steph Curry partner to launch Plezi Hydration Plezi Nutrition, the company co-founded by former First Lady Michelle Obama, announced this week that it teamed up with NBA star Steph Curry to create a healthier sports hydration drink. "I'm excited to team up with Plezi to launch Plezii Hydration, a game-changing hydration beverage that I believe can make a real difference for anyone looking to perform at their best," Curry said in a statement. "We've created something with smart ingredients and unbeatable flavor, so people can fuel their bodies the right way. No nonsense, no shortcuts — because the next generation deserves better." Plezi said the beverage touts qualities like two-times the electrolytes, half the sugar, seven-times the potassium and less sodium compared to other sports drinks. The beverage comes in three flavors — lemon lime, tropical punch and orange mango twist — and is available in 16.9-ounce bottles for $2.29. The product is available nationwide on Amazon, as well as in California at Walmart, Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions locations. “At Plezi, we're always thinking about how we can change the game when it comes to nutrition," Obama said in a statement. “We're excited to provide a delicious, healthier option for everyone who's trying to get active and stay hydrated." 7-Eleven reintroduces an April Fool’s Day sweet treat 7-Eleven’s Mystery Donut for April Fool’s Day is returning for a limited time. The Bismark-style donut features an unknown flavor filling. Customers can take their guess at the Mystery Donut flavor at participating 7-Eleven, Speedway and Stripes locations from Tuesday through April 29. "Every April, we like to add a little mischief to our bakery offerings with the Mystery Donut as an unexpected twist that's all about surprising our customers in the spirit of April Fool's Day," Brandon Brown, senior vice president of Fresh Foods at 7-Eleven, said in a statement. "It may seem like a prank, but it's no joke!” $268,553 That’s how much GameStop paid to provide executive security services for CEO Ryan Cohen for the fiscal year ending on Feb. 1. “We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, as they enable Mr. Cohen to carry out his responsibilities,” the company wrote in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop doesn’t consider the securities to be a personal benefit or compensation paid to Cohen. 120 That’s how many employees Mattel will lay off at its headquarters, according to a March 17 notice filed in California in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The permanent layoffs are effective on May 19. Mattel did not immediately respond to Retail Dive’s requests for comment. The company said last year it was targeting $200 million in cost savings by 2026. Retailers face prolonged stretch of downbeat consumer sentiment The Conference Board said this week that its measure of consumer expectations for employment, business conditions and personal finance fell to its lowest point in 12 years and uncomfortably below the threshold that can signal a recession. Its measure of consumers’ confidence in the economy fell for the fourth straight month. This tracks with other research, including last week’s University of Michigan’s monthly consumer survey, which one economist called “a horrific report.” Much of the anxiety is fueled by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which announced auto levies earlier this week. “If there was a silver lining in [The Conference Board’s] March report, it was that consumer perceptions of the labor market held steady relative to February,” Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Jeremiah Koh said in a research note this week. “Even so, an overall theme of uncertainty is broadly setting in for the consumer, and the short term policy outlook does not portend an end to this uncertainty with new tariffs on the horizon in April.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Rare Beauty and Target have taken steps to develop guidance around universally accessible design.

Title: A quality improvement initiative to increase HIV post-exposure prophylaxis treatment for emergency department patients after sexual assault: A pre-post study
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0320690

Many emergency department (ED) patients after a sexual assault face barriers to receiving HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We implemented a quality improvement initiative which updated the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template and made available free, full-course PEP treatment packs for use at provider discretion. The aim of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care before and after the initiative. This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental, pre-post study of all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 – January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention) and March 1, 2023 – October 31, 2023 (post-intervention). An odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the initiative’s effect on PEP prescribing. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the independent effect of the initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention periods. Pre-intervention, the mean age was 33.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 12.3), 94.0% were female, 30.8% Black, 31.6% Latinx, and 28.2% White. Post-intervention, the mean age was 29.2 years (SD 12.6), 90.7% were female, 42.4% Black, 28.8% Latinx, and 17.8% White. Patients were more likely to receive HIV PEP post-intervention (33/118, 28.0%) than pre-intervention (11/117, 9.4%) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8). The independent effect of the initiative on HIV PEP prescribing remained significant after controlling for demographics (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0), assault characteristics (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1), and provider experience (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). The availability of HIV PEP treatment packs plus a modification to the EHR template led to a significant increase in the provision of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault.

This conflict does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. United States (US) emergency departments (ED) provide care to tens of thousands of patients after sexual assault each year [1–3]. This care includes providing trauma-informed medical and forensic examinations, screening for sexually transmitted infections (STI), and initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for STIs, including the initiation of HIV PEP [4–6]. HIV PEP, the use of antiretroviral medications after a single high-risk event (such as may occur with sexual assault), is highly effective in preventing HIV seroconversion if taken as soon as possible after the exposure (within 72 hours) and with strict adherence to a 28-day regimen [7]. The risk of HIV transmission after sexual assault is not known but felt to be low, with the per-act risk of HIV seroconversion extrapolated from consensual vaginal (0.08%) and receptive rectal intercourse (1.38%) [7,8]. Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend HIV PEP to be considered on a case-by-case basis and after an assessment of assault-related factors that might increase the risk of HIV exposure and transmission. These factors include the likelihood that the assailant has HIV (is a man who has sex with other men or uses injection drugs) or exposure characteristics (did rectal or vaginal penetration occur or were mucosal injuries sustained) [7,9–11]. For many patients in whom HIV PEP is indicated after a sexual assault, receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course remains a significant barrier [12]. A national survey of nearly 600 US EDs showed that only 65.3% of EDs offered HIV testing and HIV PEP to patients receiving care after a sexual assault [13]. Even when EDs routinely provide HIV testing and HIV PEP after sexual assault, initial compliance with PEP depends on the ability of a patient to first obtain the prescription, which can be impeded by limited access to pharmacies and cost. And for patients who just survived sexual assault, making a separate trip to an outpatient pharmacy may be emotionally triggering and further hinder the ability to obtain medications [12]. To circumvent these barriers, the standard practice for ED HIV PEP delivery in the US is to provide a first dose of an FDA-approved regimen while the patient is still in the ED followed by a prescription for the remaining 27 days [14]. To facilitate short term compliance, some EDs will provide patients with a 3-5 day bridging starter pack in conjunction with a standard prescription [15–17]. Providing the entire 28-day PEP medication supply at the initial visit is another strategy to increase the likelihood of adherence, especially when patients face difficulties returning for follow-up visits [18]. A recent study by Cherabie et al demonstrated an innovative model where 87% of patients at risk for HIV acquisition after sexual assault were provided a full 28-day, meds-in-hand, supply of HIV PEP [19]. In February of 2023, at the Alameda Health System (AHS), Highland Hospital ED, we implemented a quality improvement initiative, “sexual assault PEP” (SA PEP), to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for sexual assault patients. The initiative included two interventions: 1) a modification to the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template to include a field prompting examiners to discuss PEP and 2) making available free 28-day supplies of meds-in-hand HIV PEP therapy (PEP treatment packs) for use at the discretion of the sexual assault examiners. The purpose of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care in the period before (pre-intervention) and after the SA PEP initiative (post-intervention). This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental pre-post study of a quality improvement initiative. We included all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 – January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention period) and March 1, 2023 – October 31, 2023 (post-intervention period). We chose this time period based on a consensus agreement among authors that 8 months was a reasonable duration of time to observe both an effect and sustainability of the intervention. The initiative was rolled out in February 2023, which served as a one-month washout period. Patients receiving a sexual assault examination during February 2023 were therefore excluded. We also excluded patients for whom PEP was not indicated (either because they were living with HIV infection or presented ≥72 hours after the assault) or who were transferred from an outside facility and received a first dose of PEP as well as a 28-day prescription by the transferring hospital. The AHS Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of written informed consent. This study was performed in the ED at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, a level-1 trauma center with an annual census of 57,000 visits. The ED supports a well-established routine HIV screening program and provides rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) using Biktarvy® (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide) starter packs (donated by Gilead, Sciences) to eligible patients [20]. The Highland Hospital ED serves as the county referral center for sexual assault forensic examinations. At the Highland Hospital ED, sexual assault forensic examinations are conducted by the department’s pool of 20 advanced practice providers (APP) who have specialized training in conducting forensic examinations, with support from a sexual assault patient advocate. Forensic assault examinations are performed within 5 days of the assault, after approval by the responsible law enforcement agency, and with the consent of the patient. The Highland ED performs approximately 180 sexual assault examinations each year, accounting for 75% of the sexual assault examinations in Alameda County for patients ≥ 14 years of age. Using a structured template, a written log with basic patient information and characteristics of the assault is completed by the APP and maintained in a locked cabinet in the sexual assault examiners’ office. Prior to the SA PEP initiative, the protocol for ED HIV PEP was Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus Tivicay® (dolutegravir) or Isentress® (raltegravir) for eligible patients presenting within 72 hours after sexual assault [21]. Eligibility for HIV PEP was based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP and was not strictly mandated. By protocol, patients were given the first doses of HIV PEP (available in the ED pyxis) as soon as possible during the index visit and then prescribed a complete course of treatment upon discharge (28 days total). Additionally, APPs could use an EHR “sexual assault” template to facilitate accurate and comprehensive documentation of encounters for sexual assault. In January of 2023, an internal review of pharmacy records identified low numbers of ED HIV PEP prescriptions and potential missed opportunities for PEP among patients evaluated after sexual assault. This prompted a meeting between the ED Director of HIV Screening (DAEW) and the APPs to discuss barriers to prescribing PEP. Citing concerns that prescriptions often go unfilled because of pharmacy copays, lack of insurance coverage, and patient difficulties accessing outpatient pharmacies for PEP, the APPs requested approval to use the Biktarvy® starter packs for HIV PEP after sexual assault. They also requested improving the sexual assault EHR template to include a field “reminding” them to assess HIV PEP eligibility. The decision to expand the indications of Biktarvy® to PEP for sexual assault patients was approved from the Division Chief of HIV Medicine, the HIV clinical pharmacy lead, and backed by recommendations of the East Bay Getting to Zero collaborative that included Biktarvy® as one of three preferred HIV PEP regimens [22]. A modification to the sexual assault template included the addition of embedded fields reminding providers to 1) discuss the risks and benefits of PEP and 2) document whether PEP was given. On February 15, 2023, the APPs were notified at a departmental staff meeting and by email that Biktarvy® starter packs could be used for HIV PEP for sexual assault patients at their discretion. APPs were instructed to obtain baseline laboratory testing to ensure the safe use of Biktarvy®, which included having liver function tests < 5 times the upper limit of normal, an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min, and a negative pregnancy test. APPs were instructed to provide eligible patients with 4 starter packs, equaling a 28-day course of PEP (each starter pack consisted of a labeled, sealed bottle containing 7 tablets). This was referred to as an HIV PEP treatment pack. If desired, standard PEP prescriptions using any FDA-recommended regimen could be provided instead of the Biktarvy® treatment packs. Eligibility for HIV PEP remained unchanged, based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP, and was not strictly mandated. The primary outcome measure was the number and proportion of patients undergoing sexual assault examinations who were provided PEP in the pre-intervention compared with the post-intervention period. The sexual assault database was used by trained research staff to identify all sexual assault forensic examinations completed between June 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023. Using a structured data collection instrument, patient level data for each forensic examination were abstracted from a review of the EHR (Epic Systems). The instrument had both closed response and free text fields. Data included patient demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), discharge time, treating APP, assault characteristics (type of penetration, condom use), whether PEP was offered and provided, and details of any PEP prescription or treatment pack given, including medication type and duration. Data was accessed for research purposes on 11/9/2023, 11/20/2023, 11/29/2023, 3/21/2024, and 3/22/2024. The authors had access to information that could identify individual participants during and after data collection. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the AHS [23,24]. REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Receipt of PEP was defined as EHR documentation that an HIV PEP prescription was electronically signed by the treating provider or an HIV PEP treatment pack was given. Patients that received only a first dose of HIV PEP while in the ED, but no additional prescription or treatment pack, were not considered as being provided HIV PEP. Incorrect PEP treatment (PEP prescribing errors) was defined as either an incorrect PEP regimen (inadequate treatment, such as Truvada® only) or an incorrect duration of treatment (total duration fewer than 28 days). Correct PEP treatment was defined as a 28-day prescription of an approved HIV PEP regimen. Risk of HIV acquisition from the sexual assault was defined as high (condomless receptive rectal or vaginal sex), moderate (condomless insertive rectal or vaginal sex), and low (insertive or receptive oral sex, exposure to blood, saliva, urine, sex with a condom) according to Pacific AIDS Education and Training Center Criteria [22]. APPs were categorized as high, moderate, or low volume examiners based on the number of sexual assault examinations performed during the study period. Categories were determined posteriori and based on tertiles of completed sexual assault examinations. Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables. Continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and means with standard deviations (SD) and categorical variables as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate. An odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated to determine the effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing for sexual assault patients. Posteriori, three multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Model 1 controlled for patient characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), model 2 controlled for assault characteristics (assailant known, risk of HIV risk exposure, discharge time), and model 3 controlled for number of sexual assault examinations performed by APPs. Statistical analyses were performed on de-identified data with Stata (version 14; StataCorp). Between June 1, 2022, and October 31, 2023, 279 patients aged ≥ 14 years underwent 288 sexual assault examinations. Of these, 53 encounters were excluded from the analysis because they occurred during the month of February 2023 (N = 23), were patients living with HIV (N = 7), received PEP at a different facility prior to transfer (N = 8), or presented ≥ 72 hours after the assault (N = 15), leaving 235 sexual assault encounters in the study population. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention period and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention period (Fig 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.g001 Overall, the mean patient age was 31.1 years (SD + /-12.5 years); 217 (92.3%) were female; 86 (36.6%) were Black, 54 (23.0%) were White, and 71 (30.2%) were Latinx. One hundred nineteen (50.6%) assaults were by a known assailant and 127 (54.0%) were documented as being at a high risk for HIV exposure. One hundred and eleven (61.3%) of the sexual assault examinations were completed by high-volume APP examiners (≥15 examinations). Only 31.1% of sexual assault patients were discharged during daytime hours (7am-3pm). Although patients in the pre-intervention period were slightly older than those in the post-intervention period(mean age 33.0 years, SD + /-12.3 years vs. mean age 29.2 years, SD + /- 2.6 years, P = 0.02), there did not appear to be any clinically meaningful differences in characteristics between the study periods (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t001 Use of the sexual assault template was similar between the study periods (pre-intervention: 98/117, 83.8%; post-intervention: 101/118, 85.6%, P = 0.70). Documentation of offering HIV PEP was infrequently recorded in the pre-intervention period (14/117, 12.0%) compared to the post-intervention period(91/118, 77.1%) (P < 0.0001). During the pre-intervention period, 11 of the 117 patients completing sexual assault examinations (9.4%) were provided PEP compared to 33 of the 118 patients (28.0%) during the post-intervention period (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8) (Table 2). Of the 33 patients receiving PEP during the post-intervention period, 22 (66.7%) received treatment packs and 11 (33.3%) received a prescription. Prescribing errors occurred with 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions (incorrect PEP regimen N = 1, incorrect treatment duration N = 2) and with none of the 22 PEP treatment packs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t002 The results of the three models of multivariable logistic regression are shown in Tables 3–5. After controlling for demographics (model 1: age, gender, and race/ethnicity) (Table 3), assault characteristics (model 2: assailant known status, HIV risk, and time of ED discharge) (Table 4), and APP experience (model 3: high, moderate, low volume examiner) (Table 5), the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing remained significant (model 1: OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0; model 2: OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1; model 3: OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t005 EDs play an essential role in the evaluation and care of patients after sexual assault, including providing HIV PEP when assault-related factors are felt to put the patient at increased risk for HIV exposure and transmission [19]. Receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course are critical for PEP to be effective in preventing HIV transmission after sexual assault and policies to minimize barriers to receiving a full 28-day course of PEP treatment should be prioritized [5–7,12]. This study evaluates the SA PEP program, a quality improvement initiative designed to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault through two strategies: 1) a modification to the sexual assault EHR template reminding providers to consider and offer PEP and 2) making available free, 28-day HIV PEP treatment packs. Combined, these strategies increased the receipt of HIV PEP three-fold, from 9.4% to 28.0%, for ED patients after sexual assault. Although the increase in PEP prescriptions during the post-intervention period cannot be attributed with 100% certainty to the SA PEP initiative alone, the differences remained statistically significant across our three logistic regression models which controlled for patient demographics, characteristics specific to the assault, and the experience of the sexual assault examiners. Although unmeasured variables may have influenced the provision of PEP in our study, we are not aware of significant changes in APP staffing, APP training, or ED census that occurred between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. Despite minimizing barriers to accessing PEP treatment with the SA PEP initiative, the proportion of patients receiving HIV PEP after sexual assault was relatively low (28%), especially when compared to other published reports of ED HIV PEP after sexual assault [15,16,19,25,26]. A large academic ED in the Northeastern US participating in a sexual assault nurse examiner program reported 124 (69%) of 179 patients receiving sexual assault examinations received HIV PEP over a 3-year period [15]. And a study conducted at the Boston Medical Center ED reported that 82 (45%) of 181 patients evaluated after sexual assault received HIV PEP in the form of a 3-day starter pack [16]. Another study in a large Midwestern ED reported that over a 13-year period, 87% of 423 patients evaluated after a sexual assault where a high-risk HIV exposure was identified received a full course of HIV PEP prior to discharge [19]. The magnitude of differences in HIV PEP treatment rates between these studies and ours may be explained, in part, by specific study exclusion criteria. In our analysis, we included patients regardless of the risk for HIV transmission (post-intervention period excluded only 15 of 133 encounters) whereas in the study by Cherabie et al, over 50% of their initial study population of 908 patients with a visit for sexual assault/abuse were excluded, including patients for whom PEP was not offered [19]. We believe the main driver of our low overall PEP numbers may be due to a low acceptance rather than a lack of offering. During the post-intervention period, EHR documentation revealed that the majority of patients (77%) were offered HIV PEP but only 28% accepted PEP, lower than other ED studies which report higher proportions of HIV PEP acceptance after sexual assault, ranging from 32% to 87% [15,16,19,25,26]. The retrospective nature of the study and available data, however, do not allow for an accurate understanding of why PEP acceptance was so low. A better understanding of the true offer and acceptance rate and reasons behind a patient’s decision to accept or decline PEP requires prospective evaluation. Importantly, we have seen an upward trend in PEP provision and the use of treatment packs with ongoing implementation of our SA PEP initiative, suggesting that the sustainability of this initiative is robust. An analysis of more recent 3 months (February 2024 to April 2024) demonstrate that PEP was provided to 50% of patients completing sexual assault examinations (26/51), with the majority (85%) being treatment packs. Sharing the outcomes from this initiative and eliciting feedback from the APPs at our site will hopefully identify foci for improvement and inform future trainings, educational sessions, and protocols designed to streamline eligibility assessments and increase the acceptance rate of PEP. We believe that providing HIV PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients after a sexual assault examination is the best strategy to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. Same day treatment for ED patients has been shown to improve compliance and decrease return visits and hospitalizations, especially for those who are underinsured or who are discharged at times when pharmacies are closed [27,28]. Prior studies have demonstrated that providing PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients is feasible and increases the receipt of PEP compared to providing standard prescriptions [29,30]. Compliance with PEP, although not assessed in our study, is further improved when single dose versus multiple dose regimens are used [31,32]. Additionally, we recommend supplying the full 28-day treatment at the time of discharge rather than a short bridging course to an outpatient prescription. Full treatment packs are associated with higher acceptance and completion rates than other PEP treatment strategies and assure that the correct medication regimen and duration are provided [33]. Incorrect PEP prescriptions by emergency physicians are not uncommon [34]. In our study, prescribing errors occurred in 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions written by physicians and in none of the PEP treatment packs. How EDs should best go about providing HIV PEP medications to patients after sexual assault, however, is complicated, and policies guiding implementation will need to be developed at the institutional level, with input from multiple departments, balancing cost, pharmacy considerations, compliance, and safety. Providing medications-in-hand, pre-discharge is not standard ED practice. Routinely providing either starter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that EDs stock PEP drugs or have an established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, and rapidly dispense PEP drugs. At our institution, we leveraged an existing hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee exemption which allowed the use of industry-provided Biktarvy® starter packs for use in the ED, expanding the indications to include HIV PEP. The use of industry-provided starter packs, donated free-of-charge, is often prohibited due to institutional policies and regulatory barriers, which may limit replication of our model. The use of ED or hospital-based pharmacies, however, can be used to ensure timely access to HIV PEP therapy for ED patients [30,35]. EDs with discharge pharmacies have been shown to reduce barriers like cost, transportation, and pharmacy access when compared to prescriptions requiring filling at local, outpatient pharmacies [35]. Further, many EDs have access to 24-hour inpatient pharmacies and protocols have been developed whereby these pharmacies store, package, and urgently dispense HIV PEP medications to patients prior to discharge [30]. An additional benefit of utilizing existing pharmacy infrastructure is that patients without insurance or with high copayments can be identified immediately and be enrolled in a patient-assistance program or a no-charge compassionate care provision can be applied [7,36]. This was a retrospective evaluation of a single center and the magnitude of influence of our intervention may not be generalizable to other EDs, particularly those with different patient populations, standardized PEP guidelines for sexual assault patients, and improved access to PEP medication dispensing, such as an in-house, 24-hour, 7-days-per-week pharmacy. The pre-post study design also makes it impossible to attribute the increased provision of PEP solely to the intervention (PEP treatment packs and updated sexual assault template), as other unmeasured factors, such as patient characteristics, examiner practice patterns, or other external events, may influence the primary outcome [37]. Additionally, the relative contribution of the EHR template modification versus the availability of PEP treatment packs with regards to driving the primary outcome measure of PEP prescribing is not known, as these were considered a bundled intervention. Both interventions likely influenced PEP prescribing. Missing data was not uncommon for several of the clinical variables abstracted from chart review (estimation of risk of HIV acquisition missing 32.8% and knowledge of assailant missing 18.5% of the time) and which were included in logistic regression, possibly reducing the model’s ability to accurately predict dependent variables. Patient centered outcomes, such as adherence with PEP, follow-up for repeat HIV testing and surveillance for HIV seroconversion, and opportunities to transition patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HIV infection to pre-exposure prophylaxis, were not assessed. Multiple studies have shown that both adherence with HIV PEP and outpatient follow up after ED initiation are extremely low [15,18,19,38,39]. Prospective studies evaluating barriers to adherence and follow-up are needed. EDs play an important role in the evaluation and care for patients after sexual assault. A clinical intervention consisting of an EHR template modification plus HIV PEP treatment packs led to a significant increase in the provision of PEP for ED patients evaluated after sexual assault and eliminated errors in treatment. Future research should evaluate medication receipt, adherence, and cost effectiveness of PEP treatment packs compared to prescriptions.

Title: International Insider: ‘No Other Land’; Series Mania Wraps; BAFTA TV Noms

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, Max Goldbart here taking you through another super busy week of news. Sign up here. ‘No Other Land‘ American Film Academy criticism: On Monday, Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham wrote in an X post that his Palestinian No Other Land co-director, Hamdan Ballal, had been attacked by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and was later detained by Israeli soldiers. The story has since moved fast. Abraham posted the next day that Ballal had been freed but was badly beaten while in custody. The 24-hour incident then sparked outcry in the film community, with strong statements from institutions including the European Film Academy. Filmmakers and actors such as Christine Vachon, Ezra Edelman, and Mark Ruffalo lent their names to public calls for Ballal’s release. The incident occurred less than a month after No Other Land won the Best Documentary Oscar, a grim fact that Abraham highlighted as he criticized the American Film Academy for “declining to publicly support” Ballal. The Academy did later send a letter to its members alluding to the incident, which Abraham posted on X and criticized for not mentioning Ballal. The American Academy rarely makes public statements about detentions or instances of violence against Academy winners, but in 2011, it did call for the release of multiple detained Iranian filmmakers, we have noted. The Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Police have denied being involved in any beating. Israeli authorities have said that Ballal was detained along with several others on suspicion of throwing stones, damaging property, and compromising the security of the area. The incident is devastating and comes as global stakeholders once again try to bring about ceasefire for a conflict that has lasted nearly 18 months. Related Stories News Monica Dolan, The First Actress This Decade To Be Nommed For Two TV BAFTAs In One Year, Says Industry Is "Plagued By Fear" Documentary 'No Other Land' Directors Thank Academy Members For Coming To Defense Of Hamdan Ballal After Attack Series Mania Wraps Up Cautious optimism and star power: Another year down for European TV’s biggest get-together and Series Mania is now certainly very much established as such. Myself, Jesse and Stewart have spent the week in Lille taking the temperature of the global TV biz and seeing what people have to say. The vibe on the ground was cautious optimism, as creatives and producers embrace challenges with spirit. Check out our five takeaways dive deep into what people were discussing. The funding crisis in drama was front and center, although we found that this is very much not a “one size fits all” problem and some are experiencing it more acutely than others. Stewart also had a think about the future of the fest as it hits a crossroads – it has become so big now (we hear attendance this year was up 20%) that it feels as though it could comfortably swallow up the now-defunct Cannes-based MIPTV and beyond. At the same time, star power at Series Mania only rises, with the likes of Amanda Seyfried, Christina Hendricks and Pamela Adlon all out and about and seemingly having a whale of a time in northern France. What could be next for this buzzy festival? We’ll be keeping a close eye. All our coverage from the week can be found here. BAFTA Turns To Small Screen Reindeers & Horses: While the BBC will no doubt point to a 75-nom haul as evidence the corporation remains at the peak of its power, yesterday’s BAFTA TV Awards anno shone a light on a trio of the biggest British streaming hits. Baby Reindeer topped the charts with eight, followed closely by Apple TV+’s Slow Horses and Disney+’s Rivals, with big names like Gary Oldman, Jonathan Pryce (for the first time) and Richard Gadd being recognized from these shows. The noms come at a time when funding local British drama is getting harder and harder, and it was therefore satisfying to see ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office neck-and-neck with these splashy streamer hits. Speaking to us afterwards, BAFTA boss Jane Millichip warned of “choppy waters” if the drama affordability issues aren’t resolved. She also pointed out that the tonal barriers are breaking down between shows commissioned by the broadcasters and the streamers. This time next year, two Netflix breakouts that are currently tearing up the global charts yet feel very much like they could have found a home at a British broadcaster, Adolescence and Toxic Town, might be in with a shout for BAFTAs, Millichip suggested. Elsewhere, there were high-profile snubs in the form of The Day of the Jackal, Wolf Hall’s Mark Rylance and Prime Video receiving just one nomination, while there were happy surprises like the always popular Billie Piper being recognized for Netflix’s Scoop. Jake’s “snubs and surprises” deep dive can be viewed here. The awards take place May 11. Jennifer Salke Out Bond seals Jen’s fate: The first top exec change at a global streamer since 2020 happened overnight. Jennifer Salke is out over at Amazon MGM, although she will segue to a producer first-look deal at the same company. As there are already separate TV and film bosses at Amazon MGM, Salke will not be replaced, with Courtenay Valenti (film) and Vernon Sanders (TV) now reporting directly to Mike Hopkins. More restructuring is expected to follow and we are already hearing this could impact international, where Amazon has recently made layoffs and shuffled its pack. Salke’s legacy is mixed. Big hits including The Boys, Fallout and Mr. & Mrs. Smith have come during her tenure, but they have been relatively few and far between and have run concurrent with scrutiny over expensive projects like The Rings of Power and the Russos’ Citadel. Furthermore, Mike Fleming Junior writes that Salke’s “inability to mesh with the gatekeepers of the James Bond movies” might well have sealed her fate. “While her exit from the executive suites officially is being regarded as an exit by choice into a producing deal, sources in town say it is closer to a firing,” he writes. Ears to the ground over what comes next for Amazon. ‘Holy Cow’! A cheesy win: I wanted to drop what I was doing and do my best to stream Holy Cow immediately upon reading Melanie’s fab Global Breakout piece this week. Mel took us to France, where Holy Cow, the feature directorial debut of Louise Courvoisier, has drawn close to 1 million spectators locally. The movie follows a teenager raised in a farming community in the Eastern department of Jura who embarks on a mission to make a prize-winning wheel of Comté cheese in the face of a series of hard knocks. Sounds brie-liant to me. Mel writes that while Holy Cow may not seem like a crowd-pleaser or box office breakout on paper, it has managed to gross roughly $6.5M from a $2.1M (€2M) budget. The pic also won best first film at the French César awards. Check out the Breakout over here. The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: Simon Pegg movie Angels in the Asylum has stopped shooting indefinitely after running out of cash mid-way through production. 🌶️ Another: Kaley Cuoco is leading buzzy suspense TV drama Vanished alongside Sam Claflin, three-time Cesar winner Karin Viard and German actor Matthias Schweighöfer. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Our roving International Editor-At-Large brought news that Willem Dafoe has launched a program at Venice. ❌ Charged: Gérard Depardieu has been requested an 18-month suspended prison sentence following his sexual assault trial this week. 🤝 Done deal: Canada’s Bell Media has bought a majority stake in Leaving Neverland distributor Sphere Abacus. 🚪 Exiting: Fremantle Asia and Lat AM CEO Ganesh Rajaram, after 20 years. 🍿 Box office: Nancy broke the exclusive news that Pablo Larraín’s Maria has become the Chilean filmmaker’s highest grossing movie at the international box office. 💼 New job: September 5 co-producer Constanze Guttman has joined Leonine. ⛺ Fest latest: Glasgow Film Festival industry boss Samantha Andie Bennett chatted with Diana about a busy year. 👀 First footage: Of Stay Forte, which stars Judd Hirsch and Selma Blair as Israeli hostages who, after a desperate escape from the tunnel network in Gaza, tragically fall victim to friendly fire.

Title: Forbes Daily: U.S. Tourism Is Taking A Hit From Trump’s Policies

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Last year was a banner year for companies in the S&P 500. But for small businesses, the picture is more complicated. For the first time in three years, more small businesses reported a drop in revenue in 2024 than an increase, a new Fed survey shows. Meanwhile, around 75% of firms in the S&P reported year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, according to data from FactSet. Still, the picture isn’t entirely gloomy. Fewer small businesses said costs were going up, meaning customers may not be spending less—the companies just may not be pushing through as many price increases that inflate revenue. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY NATHAN DUMLAO/UNSPLASH After Donald Trump won the election in November, conditions seemed ripe for a boom in mergers and acquisitions after several years of declines. But that hasn’t happened yet, primarily due to Trump’s tariffs and other moves that have sparked fears of a slowdown. The Trump Administration’s policies—from tariffs to the high-profile detentions of foreigners with legal tourist visas and green cards—are having a negative impact on tourism to the U.S., a growing body of data shows. Tourism Economics, a nonpartisan Oxford Economics company, is forecasting total U.S. travel spending will be 3.7% lower than its original prediction from December, amounting to an estimated $64 billion loss this year for the U.S. economy. The New York Stock Exchange’s parent company signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle, issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin, to explore integrating Circle’s products into its trading and clearing empire. Stablecoins are having a moment amid a legislative push from the Trump Administration, which sees the tokens as a key way to maintain the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Gather Health cofounder and CEO Brent Asplin with patient Karen Sterling. After watching patients come to the emergency room for chronic diseases, Dr. Brent Asplin launched a primary care startup, Gather Health, to focus specifically on higher risk older people. The firm has signed up more than 2,500 patients, all of whom are 65 or older and on Medicare. And with $17 million in new funding, he projects revenue will explode by 25 times to reach $44 million this year. AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Federal Election Commission, an independent agency charged with enforcing campaign finance laws, is issuing rulings and functioning with just four remaining members after President Donald Trump’s unprecedented firing of longtime Democratic member Ellen Weintraub. Following Weintraub’s ouster, which Democrats say is illegal, the agency now requires unanimous agreement to take any significant action, which is difficult considering it is often split along party lines. As Republicans seek to protect their tight majority in the House, President Donald Trump withdrew his nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for United Nations Ambassador. Republicans hold just five more seats than Democrats in the House, after two GOP members resigned—controversial former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who took himself out of the running for Attorney General, and former Rep. Michael Waltz, who resigned to become Trump’s national security advisor. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a United Nations-led temporary administration to govern Ukraine, said he believes President Donald Trump was sincere about ending the Ukraine war and suggested that Trump’s bid to annex Greenland was “rooted in history.” Putin, whose administration has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the Volodymyr Zelenskyy-led Ukrainian government, implied that such a temporary administration would be necessary for ending the war in Ukraine, though Zelenskyy and his administration have yet to respond. Shalom Meckenzie of Amp Shalom Meckenzie made a $1.4 billion fortune after merging his software company SBTech with DraftKings and going public via a SPAC. With his latest venture Amp Fitness, he’s hoping there’s a big business in at-home workouts. Amp’s business model is nearly identical to that of a slew of failed and struggling exercise companies like Tonal, Peloton and Mirror: Sell wealthy folks an expensive machine, hire a bunch of celebrity trainers, collect “data” and then pray you can make money by expanding into more profitable ancillary markets like personalized nutrition, subscriptions and apparel before the customers get bored and move on. It hasn’t worked for anyone else, but that’s not stopping Meckenzie, who is largely self-financing the company for now. A minimalist version of a cable crossover machine found at any gym, the wall-mounted Amp costs $2,000, and accessing the trainers (both AI and human) through the app requires a $23 monthly subscription. Amp, which launched sales in January, has hired a dozen or so fitness influencers and minor celebrities as trainers, the most famous of whom is America’s Got Talent host Terry Crews. Still, the connected at-home fitness device market is ultracompetitive and highly saturated. It boomed during the pandemic but is now littered with the shells of companies vastly better financed and much earlier to market than Amp. But Meckenzie has dealt with doubters before. “When I started SBTech, many people came to me and said, ‘Shalom, you’re stupid, you’re using all the money you have and [money] you don’t have, and you’re going to get you and your family in trouble,’ ” he says. “When people offend me, that’s what keeps me going.” WHY IT MATTERS “The at-home fitness market is rife with challenges, fads and fickle customers,” says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. “After the pandemic-induced valuation boom went bust, companies like Peloton and Tonal fell back down to Earth, while products like Mirror were discontinued. Shalom Meckenzie believes his company Amp can avoid making similar mistakes incumbent companies made and says he has made a superior device infused with AI and other tech. At half the price of Tonal, it’s now up to the customers to decide.” MORE How A Swedish Fitness Toy Went Viral Thanks To Tom Brady, RFK Jr. And An Army Of Celebrities The latest target of the Trump Administration’s cost-cutting efforts is Health and Human Services, as agency head Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced layoffs Thursday.

Title: Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight date confirmed

Hereâs a question Iâm sure plagues most brides: is it better to go into space before or after your wedding? So much goes into planning the big day, Iâd think a lot of people would opt for waiting to play astronaut until after. But Lauren SÃ¡nchez is not most people. When others say formal winter attire, Lauren hears uncovered bustier. So naturally the noted journalist, bestselling author, pilot, entrepreneur, philanthropist, chairperson, and future Mrs. Bezos, is going the other way (as in, away from Earth), and squeezing in an aerospace flight ahead of her nuptials. Fresh off of the confirmation this week that Lauren and Jeff are marrying in Venice this summer, Blue Origin (the groomâs company) has just announced their first all-woman space mission is set to blastoff on April 14. How do we know theyâre all set to launch? Because theyâve got the official mission patch graphic! Blue Origin is ready to send several superstars to space. The launch date for the upcoming flight, which will include Katy Perry, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyá» n, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn and Lauren SÃ¡nchez, was confirmed this week. New Shepardâs NS-31 11th human flight will be Monday, April 14. It will lift off from Launch Site One in West Texas. The New Shepard launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC. Additionally, Blue Origin released the NS-31 mission patch. Per the company, a few of the key symbols embedded include: The target star symbolizes Aisha Boweâs ambition for setting big goals, passion for STEM, and commitment to inspiring future generations. The scales of justice symbolize Amanda Nguyá» nâs efforts to advocate for civil rights, break barriers, and empower everyday people to create change. The shooting star microphone represents Gayle Kingâs commitment to sharing important stories with the world. The firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy. The film reel symbolizes Kerianne Flynnâs passion for filmmaking, storytelling, and crafting beautiful narratives. Flynn the Fly, the main character in Lauren SÃ¡nchezâs bestselling childrenâs book, The Fly Who Flew to Space, is along for the ride. The story is about overcoming adversity, inspiring kids with learning differences to pursue their dreams. [From Just Jared] Real talk: how likely is it that the designer of that mission patch got paid an astronomically higher fee than anyone makes at Amazon? Also, âThe firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy,â made me chuckle. Why not just say itâs a nod to her song?! Katy was recently confirmed to be on Lauren and Jeffâs wedding guest list, as was Gayle King. So my next question is: is New Shepard NS-31 the bachelorette party? If so, I hope the invites said, âWill be out of this world!â (I know, I know, Iâm hilarious.) In all seriousness, I hope the flight runs smoothly and safely, and that all women aboard make it back in time for the weddingâ¦ and the rest of their lives. The recent spate of layoffs at Blue Origin has me worried, which probably wonât go away until after this whole unnecessary joyride once in a lifetime experience is over. And on top of that, the takeoff is in West Texas, currently battling an entirely preventable measles outbreak. The world is so fun right now.

Same as Demi Moore. Both had very overdone liplifts. I observed a similar strained chin movement with Kate Hudson in Running Point, but to a lesser extent. They all look the same when they try to eat, for example, when you actually need to close your lips sometimes. Try to lift your upper lip with a finger right under your nose and try to speak or close you mouth. So noticeable.

Title: Is AMZN Stock Still A Growth Engine?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AMZN Stock Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has declined by around 10% so far this year, as investors grow increasingly concerned about the possibility of escalating trade disputes. President Trump has floated a 25% tariff on auto imports and indicated that more tariffs could be levied on European and Canadian products if he believes they harm the U.S. economy.[1] Still, AMZN stock is up 145% when measured from early 2023, thanks largely to three key drivers: We'll take a closer look at these dynamics. For more details, check out our dashboard on Why Amazon Stock Moved. While AMZN has seen a strong run-up, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Amazon’s solid revenue growth is fueled by long-term trends in e-commerce, streaming, and digital advertising. As the leading player in U.S. online retail with a 38% market share, Amazon benefits from multiple revenue streams, especially through its innovative advertising model, which generates income from both ad placements and resulting sales. A key to this growth has been Amazon’s diversification strategy, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) playing a major role. From 2020 to 2024, AWS grew at an average annual rate of 24.4%, far exceeding the growth of its North America (13.2%) and International (8.7%) operations. This underscores the impact of Amazon’s long-term investments in infrastructure, including data centers, e-commerce tools, and logistics networks. Looking forward, while AWS remains a crucial growth engine, Amazon faces rising competition in cloud computing. Rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are gaining ground. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI and its aggressive AI investments could give it an edge, while Google continues to expand its generative AI offerings. These developments highlight the need for Amazon to continue innovating to maintain its leadership in the tech sector. After years of scaling operations, Amazon is now beginning to realize the payoff of its strategic investments. Its adaptability and focus across high-growth industries continue to reinforce its position in the digital economy. AWS has played a pivotal role in Amazon’s financial evolution, helping to significantly boost profitability. From 2022 to 2024, Amazon’s operating margin surged from 2.4% to 10.8% — a five-fold increase. This improved profitability, paired with strong revenue growth and AWS’s rapid expansion, has shifted investor sentiment in Amazon’s favor. During this period, Amazon’s price-to-sales multiple nearly doubled from 1.7x to 3.4x, signaling renewed confidence in its growth outlook. This rebound came amid broader market turmoil, especially the inflation-driven market sell-off in 2022. At the time, Amazon stock dropped sharply — down 52% from a January 2022 peak of $170.40 to $81.82 by December. That decline outpaced the S&P 500’s 25.4% fall. It wasn’t until February 2024 that AMZN recovered to its prior high, demonstrating both the stock’s volatility and resilience. Now trading at $200, Amazon's stock carries a P/S ratio of 3.4x, roughly in line with its five-year average of 3.2x. Still, there are solid reasons to believe the multiple could rise further. Amazon’s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence offer significant upside across several business segments. Within AWS, a surge in AI-driven app development is expected to drive increased demand for cloud infrastructure. On the retail side, AI-powered enhancements in product recommendations, search, and personalization could meaningfully lift performance. These improvements are likely to boost conversion rates, increase average order values, and improve advertising efficiency both on Amazon’s platform and beyond. Sales are expected to grow at a low double-digit pace in the coming years, with profits projected to grow even faster. With rising profitability, ongoing AWS momentum, and sustained dominance in e-commerce, Amazon may see further expansion in its valuation multiple. Investors could view these strategies as strong catalysts for future gains. We estimate Amazon’s valuation at $244 per share — about 20% above current levels — based on a P/S multiple of 4.1x, 20% higher than the current 3.4x. Notably, the increase in AMZN stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While AMZN may still have room to climb, it’s worth exploring how Amazon’s Peers stack up on key financial metrics. You can find more comparisons across industries on Peer Comparisons.

Title: Rolling Consumer Boycotts Stalk Amazon, Target And Tesla

ByDeArbea Walker ByDeArbea Walker, Forbes Staff. Consumers are organizing "#TeslaTakedown" protests online to show their anger toward CEO Elon Musk. Consumer activists have launched rolling economic boycotts of Target, Amazon and other recognizable companies in recent weeks to protest DEI rollbacks and policies seemingly aimed at appeasing the Trump administration. The outcome of these campaigns hinges on how deeply the companies feel their effects and whether consumers can find suitable alternatives. The People's Union USA, a consumer advocacy group organizing many of the boycotts, has set its sights this week on Nestlé, for what the group's founder John Schwarz says is the company's failure to address allegations of toxic ingredients and unethical business practices. This action follows calls to boycott retailers Amazon and Target for rollbacks to their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Nestlé did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, anger toward the electric vehicle maker Tesla has boiled over as public antipathy toward its CEO, Elon Musk, seems to have grown since he became the Trump administration's chief cost-cutter. These consumer initiatives may indicate the start of a "Great Rejection," which is gaining momentum online to stop spending on nonessential goods, Greg Petro, Forbes Investing contributor, says. “Whether or not a recession is in the cards this year, the evidence is clear that frustration stalks the retail aisles,” Petro writes. Consumers don’t stop spending altogether during boycotts, opening up opportunities for small businesses to attract new customers looking for alternatives, Forbes entrepreneurs contributor Allyson Kapin writes. “Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection — a re-allocation — of spending power,” Kapin says. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Black and Latino consumer groups have avoided Target and Walmart, noting the retailers' announced rollbacks of their DEI policies late last year. During The People’s Union USA’s Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, Target saw a 9% drop in foot traffic and a 14% drop in web traffic, according to Similarweb. “For now, at least in the short term, it seems that these boycotts are having an effect, but the question is how long it will last,” Forbes contributor Doug Melville writes. Black activists are focusing on Target because they see the company's about-face on DEI frustrating after its outspokenness during the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020, Pam Danziger, a Forbes retail contributor writes. Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, had committed to purchasing $2 billion worth of goods from Black businesses by the end of 2025. And the retailer promised to increase its Black workforce by 20% and pledged to establish an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee. “Target seems to be particularly vulnerable,” Danziger writes, noting the company was seen as "a high-profile partner in the diversity, equity and inclusion movement, only to be perceived as abandoning the cause.” "We would expect some loyalty, some decency and some camaraderie,” Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and lead voice of the 40-day economic boycott, told CNN. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Target declined to comment but pointed Forbes to a statement it released in January, when it announced rollbacks of DEI initiatives. It reads in part: “We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion.” Target has been one of the most visible brands to raise the ire of consumer activists, and the retailer may face its biggest test this week when stores offer up to 40% off for Circle Week — slated to go head-to-head with Amazon’s Prime Week. Data from the sales "should be able to paint a better picture of these consumer efforts," Melville says. Amazon, which was the subject of a week-long boycott earlier this month, has shown some resilience, according to Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters. The e-commerce giant saw a 6% uptick in traffic from the previous eight weeks when The People’s Union USA boycotted March 7 to 14, according to Momentum Commerce. Before the Amazon boycott, 9% of shoppers planned to participate, but when the time came, the data showed a different story, according to Masters. “The disparity between stated boycott intentions and sales impact underscores a well-documented gap between what consumers say they’ll do and what they actually do,” Masters says. With consumers participating in a variety of boycotts and protests, small businesses wonder if there will be an opportunity for them to win customers. The grocery space offers some insights. Since 2020, consumer spending at farmers’ markets has increased more than 20%, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. Consumers seem to be gravitating to farmers' markets looking for more locally sourced and safer food options, Stephanie Gravalese, a Forbes dining contributor writes. “If the blackout encourages even a fraction of participants to shift toward local alternatives, it could reinforce an existing movement prioritizing small food businesses over corporate chains — a shift that may already be underway,” Gravalese writes. However, while consumers look for non-corporate options for everyday goods, many fear a complete drop-off in consumer spending in response to the boycotts. Inflation, perhaps stiffened by tariffs, and uncertainty over the future of the labor market have left consumers feeling uneasy. Last month, consumer confidence dropped seven points to its lowest level since 2021, according to The Conference Board, a nonpartisan think tank. “While the Great Rejection is not a real thing yet, it is an idea that consumers are warming to — spend less and save more — that could be with us for some time to come,” Petro writes. Even with boycotts planned through the summer, Shelley Kohan, a Forbes retail contributor, writes that the biggest question is how can consumers voice their fury without tanking the economy. While the boycotts aim “to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake,” Kohan says. Tesla sales have been down worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Europe. It's not just DEI cuts that have some consumers upset. The #Teslatakedown social media campaign targets Tesla, one of the largest and most recognizable electric car makers, led by Musk. “Every action he makes is met with an equal reaction online, often with the hashtag,” Peter Suciu, a Forbes social media contributor writes of Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man and the CEO of SpaceX, Starlink, X and Tesla, has been one of the most visible and prolific fundraisers and supporters of President Trump and backed far-right political parties in the U.K. and Germany. With Trump's blessing, Musk has overseen mass layoffs and spending cuts across the federal government in his role as head of the Department Of Government Efficiency. Musk has defended DOGE, saying that the project, aimed at cutting up to $2 trillion in government money, is addressing what he sees as widespread fraud in federal spending. However, Musk has been met with fierce backlash from the public, especially as he’s turned his attention to popular programs like Medicaid and Social Security. “Stealing from Social Security is not easy,” Forbes senior contributor Howard Gleckman writes. “The agency tracks employment and payroll tax payments for all workers with a Social Security number and automatically calculates old age benefits. It is very hard to game that system.” “The real risk," Gleckman says: "Trump Administration efforts to fire thousands of Social Security employees will reduce their ability to catch fraud.” Consumer dissatisfaction with Musk has already slowed Tesla's growth. Since late last year, sales have decreased worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Germany — down 76%. The company's share price has also fallen 43% since Inauguration Day, and more than $650 billion has been wiped from the company's valuation. Musk's fortune has shrunk $104 billion, according to Forbes' wealth estimates. “There are several reasons for Tesla's poor results, such as the changeover of the Model Y, falling Model 3 sales and stronger competition from rival EVs," Peter Lyon, a Forbes cars and bikes contributor writes. "Industry analysts have also put some blame for Tesla’s slump in Germany on local dissent at Musk's interference in local elections and support of the far-right AfD party.” Protests against Musk and Tesla have taken different forms: While some Tesla owners have joined consumer activism efforts by trading in their vehicles, other protests have included vandalism. How much retailers will feel the effects of consumer boycotts is still unknown, and whether or not shoppers will find lasting alternatives to the retail giants remains to be seen. “Given the increasing political divide in the country, politics is infiltrating many non-political dimensions of life, like shopping,” Danziger says. The key for retailers, big and small, may be to proceed cautiously. Kapin points out that small businesses may have opportunities while shoppers are frustrated with the big retailers. But in some ways, all retailers’ prospects are linked. “The tension between consumer activism and economic reality sits at the heart of this economic blackout debate,” Kohan writes. “While The People’s Union USA’s campaign aims to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake.”

Title: Tech has a new power base in DC

Washington, DC, investors have long hoped to make the capital a tech startup hub. In Trump's second term, those ambitions are finally taking hold. The new presidential administration has brought a number of Silicon Valley heavyweights to Washinton. Big names in tech and venture capital like Tesla's Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz's Scott Kupor now hold positions in the federal government, while other Big Tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are spending more time in Washington, hoping to exert their influence on new tech policies. Washington is already seeing rising VC interest — the top-tier venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst have opened offices in the area in the past year, and hot defense tech startups with significant DC footprints, such as Anduril, are landing more checks and contracts. Just last week, A16z hosted an "American Dynamism" conference in Washington, with opening remarks by Vice President JD Vance. "It's time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests of the United States of America writ large," Vance said at the summit. Now, Washington is welcoming a wave of tech elites, many with backgrounds in startups and VC, that are "startup curious," said James Barlia, the executive director of the startup incubator Station DC. "There's a new power base that's forming in DC, and it's creating a real opportunity for founders," he said. Paige Soya, a managing partner at K St Capital, a local VC firm and angel syndicate, said the arrival of the tech aristocracy, along with other affluent officials in Trump's administration, is driving a real estate rush for luxury multimillion-dollar properties in the district — and bringing the potential for those elites to angel invest in local startups. "A lot of these people would have never thought of DC as a place to find good deals. But because they're here, they're organically starting to see it. I think that's going to impact funding on its own," she said. Barlia is optimistic that tech's elevated presence in the district will do more than bring money to the DC startup community: It could inject Washington with a dose of Silicon Valley's culture of disruption. "I feel like there's now deeper connectivity between Silicon Valley and DC, including ideologically and philosophically," he said. In the past year, as AI took over Silicon Valley and Trump effused a pro-tech, anti-AI-regulation stance during his presidential campaign, several powerful VCs emerged to support Trump's administration. Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Founder's Fund, posted on X after Trump chose Vance as his running mate, '"IT'S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY." Their exuberance brings new momentum to DC's tech ecosystem, which has been steadily growing as startups seek government contracts and influence on Capitol Hill. The district now boasts the fifth-most-developed VC ecosystem in the US, according to PitchBook, despite being the country's 23rd-largest city, per 2022 Census data. Tech giants like Palantir, which runs an office in Georgetown, and Microsoft, which has offices in Washington's Mt. Vernon Square and across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, have helped draw in tech and investment talent over time. Now, VC firms like A16z and General Catalyst aren't the only ones interested in the DMV's startup scene — the district itself is now betting on area startups. Mayor Muriel Bowser launched DC's first Venture Capital Program in December, with $26 million to invest in early-stage DC startups. Soya's K St Capital was picked to manage the funds. Every dollar of public funding has to be matched by private funding, Soya noted, so DC startups could receive up to $52 million through the program. K St Capital has been building its DC firm for over a decade alongside other early-stage investors such as Saas Ventures, founded in 2017. Newer projects such as District Angels launched last year to pool local angel investors to back DC startups. However, while the Trump administration has forged a newfound alliance with the tech industry, the Department of Government Efficiency's slew of cuts to federal agencies could threaten the industry's growth in Washinton. The district's chief financial officer has estimated that the layoffs could cost DC more than 40,000 jobs over the next four years. But Barlia said he thinks Elon Musk's much-criticized push to "trim the fat" in the federal government will make Washington stronger. "Elon's approach may make some people uncomfortable, but the underlying problem is undeniable. Yes, there's near-term disruption — RIFs and potential economic contraction — but in the long run, it should push DC to build a more resilient, opportunity-rich economy," he said. "That won't come from more government or big corporate jobs, but by embracing new ideas, startups, and innovation." Washington is, first and foremost, a government town, with an inherent federal bureaucracy that's at odds with many startups' "move fast and break things" ethos, said John Doyle, a former Palantir executive and the founder of the defense startup Cape. Still, Doyle and Barlia said they're seeing interest from federal agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, to work with startups and move fast — faster than is typical of the government, at least. Chris Morales, a Point72 Ventures defense tech partner who's based in DC, pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's March memo about the DoD's plans to modernize how it acquires software and contracts with companies. Morales said the memo is one of multiple signs his firm is seeing that the agency is getting more serious about tech innovation. While Soya and Barlia said they're seeing startups across various industries gain traction in Washington, defense tech easily remains the hottest among them. Cape landed its first contract with the Department of Defense in 2023 in a deal to provide its cybersecurity-focused mobile carrier services to Naval forces in Guam after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group targeted the base's tech infrastructure. Cape has since raised $61 million in financing rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz and A*, announced in April 2024. Doyle said part of the reason Cape picked DC as its headquarters was to rub shoulders with the federal agencies it hoped to partner with. As he said, "proximity matters." It's no surprise then that a number of defense tech startups have opened offices in Washington, including Anduril, which recently raised $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation in August, and Shield AI, which raised $240 million this month in a funding round that valued the autonomous drone maker at $5.3 billion. Startups in the DMV can also tap into the area's hard tech talent, which could help continue to boost the area's presence as a tech hub. Northern Virginia hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of data centers. Amazon opened its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, in 2023. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, have outposts in the area. And many of the country's largest aerospace and defense companies, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are headquartered in the DMV. Doyle said the DMV's deep bench of technical expertise has helped Cape find numerous backend engineers in the area. He admitted, though, that Washington has a smaller candidate pool than traditional tech hubs like San Francisco and New York City. Cape also has a New York office, for which Doyle said it's generally easier to source talent, especially front-end engineers and designers. As some VCs flock to the DC area, others are fleeing. Sequoia Capital plans to shutter its DC office at the end of March and cut its policy team there, despite other major VC firms moving in. A Sequoia spokesperson told BI that the firm built its policy team in DC to strengthen its connections and its portfolio companies' connections with policymakers and other experts. The policy team set Sequoia up favorably to carry those relationships forward in the US and Europe, the spokesperson said. Khosla Ventures managing director Keith Rabois said at a conference in February that Washington "definitely still is not where early-stage venture capitalists should be spending too much time," despite saying he'd recently run into Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the city. DC's venture scene may not yet rival San Francisco's, but it's feeling fresh momentum nonetheless. A16z's American Dynamism Summit largely set out to connect San Francisco's VC ecosystem with Washington policymakers, but DC-based investors were also in attendance this year, said Jonathan Lacoste, a general partner at Austin-based Space VC, who attended the conference. "There were plenty of investors at the event, not just from the West Coast, but increasingly from DC's venture landscape too," he told BI. As DC's tech community grows, so does its appetite for more networking opportunities. Catherine McMillan, an analyst at the tech-focused consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, founded the DC chapter of the GenAI Collective, a generative AI networking nonprofit started in San Francisco in 2023. McMillan also helps run two other tech communities in the district: DC Tech Parties and She's In Tech. McMillan's DC chapter of the GenAI collective now has 700 members, with each event bringing in fresh faces. "It's an undervalued tech market because it doesn't have the same level of visibility that SF or New York have. That's part of what I'm trying to do, shed a light on the cool entrepreneurial things that are happening in the DMV," she said. "We have a Big Tech presence, but we also have an ecosystem in its own right." Jump to

Title: The State of OTT and CTV Monetization 2025
URL: https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=168651
Time Published: 2025-03-28T08:35:00Z
Full Content:
There’s an old saying about advertising: “Half the money spent on advertising is working; we just don’t know which half.” The same could be said about the comments you hear regarding the state of advertising. Or maybe it’s our expectations more than our perceptions that don’t match reality. Conversation about monetization is so nuanced that after a decade of writing on this topic, I am still looking for meaning where there may be little to find. Essentially, what I’ve come to understand is that ad­vertising is like the stock market: Certain aspects of advertising deals are not transparent now and may never become fully transparent. What is clear, ac­cording to research from Statista, is that 64% of rev­enue growth in the U.S. in OTT is coming from ad­vertising. More details on that in a moment. The expectation that buying advertising should be the same in streaming as it is in linear TV is unrealis­tic. “When buyers traditionally bought TV, they were able to see exactly where their campaigns were run­ning—show and time—and theoretically, they knew exactly how many people watched,” says Tameka Kee, SVP of programming and operations at the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM). “When it comes to streaming, none of that is true. Buyers do deserve to know where and how their campaigns run, but I think that they’re holding streaming to a higher standard than they held TV to.” Regardless of what ad buyers expect, the more phil­osophical question is, “Why should TV and streaming be the same?” “In the past 12–18 months, as an indus­try, we’ve been far more open to things we were never open to before,” says Karen Babcock, VP of advertis­ing strategy and partnerships at Comcast. “Looking back 10 years, advertisers, for all intents and pur­poses, bought [gross rating points], and they bought spots. And when they did that, they were buying it based off of the content it was running in.” They were really buying audiences, she contends, but preferred to think of them as content. “With the growth of streaming,” Babcock explains, “this whole idea of ‘What content am I landing in’ and ‘I bought this show for this reason’ is almost trans­formed into, ‘I need to reach Nadine somewhere where is she watching,’ and ‘How can I find a way to reach her at the right amount of times?’” For better or worse, there’s a lot more information floating out there today about me and every other consumer, so answers to those questions are more readily available now than they were a decade ago. Everyone, of course, speaks about targeting viewers in a privacy-compliant way, although the accuracy of that phrase seems open to debate. As a refresher, advertising, in the best circumstanc­es, is bought based on content channel, ratings, genre, and audience. “It’s trying to make sure you’re sending the right identifiers, so the advertiser can choose how they want to match their audience,” says Reed Barker, head of advertising at Philo. These identifiers can in­clude Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), Google’s PAIR, Yahoo Con­nectID, Epsilon’s COREid, LiveRamp’s RampId, etc. The advertiser is bidding on a block of known data, which in the U.S. includes identifiers created by var­ious groups. The Trade Desk describes its UID2 as “an identity fabric for the open internet.” In this and other identifiers, data is hashed so it remains spe­cific about a consumer’s interests, but not specific to a person, with direct identifiers removed. However, anonymous details like age, income, and education remain, plus other data that enhances advertisers’ ability to target viewers. Then, device ID and IP ad­dress are thrown into a Venn diagram-like graph, with the resulting intersection of a cohort who likes a certain thing, lives in a particular place, makes a certain amount of money, and has specific beliefs. For a subscription service, this will also be matched to subscriber’s information if they’re authenticated. The nature of modern streaming is that the ser­vices were started by many different companies, and ad buyers need to work within this realm. Psycholo­gists say the dynamic of doing the same thing (in this case, buying advertising in streaming) and expecting a different result is not going to get you very far. You really need to change, whether you want to or not. The question is, “Will this advertising market actu­ally adapt to the new normal of streaming?” Expecting digital to be bought the same way as linear is not re­alistic, no matter how much people want it to be. How­ever, the business of advertising seems to be ticking along fairly well if you look at overall stats. Statista reports on the revenue of what it classifies as OTT. This includes digital media distribution by SVOD, digital purchases via download or permanent cloud storage (electronic sell-through, or EST), OTT video advertising, and FAST services, such as Pluto TV or Tubi. In the U.S., Statista notes, revenue is expected to reach $146.30 billion in 2025. The largest revenue share in OTT belongs to video advertising, with an ex­pected 2025 U.S. revenue of $93.88 billion. U.S. annual growth rate is pegged at 7.25%, and OTT has captured 71.7% of U.S. consumers. However, YouTube has 16% of this market. The average revenue per user (ARPU) Statista reports for OTT is $593.30. I think it’s safe to say we’re in the late stage of consumer adoption. Other regions’ general adoption is as follows: Statista also predicts a compound annual growth rate of 5.8% for Latin America for 2025–2029, result­ing in a projected market volume of $14.56 billion. There has been a business model ping-pong match of subscriptions, ad-supported content (later to in­clude FAST), subscriptions with ads, transactional content, and even outright content purchases. In 2024–2025, advertising came out on top. “If you’re depending on a single revenue model, then you’re sort of stuck at the whims of the mar­ketplace,” says Philo’s Barker. “You want to have at least a baseline of guaranteed dollars, which comes from subscriptions. I’d like to have the same margin on the subscription, and if I’m not going to get it, if it has ads, then I’m going to have extra margin from ads so I can charge less for the subscription. Where is the profit coming from?” One wonders if that means the ad-supported mod­el has a larger potential for growth. “It does, but you can only show so many ads to people based on how engaged they are with your platform,” Barker says. “There’s still a finite number of hours that people watch TV and a finite number of ads you can show in an ad-supported environment. I’ve seen multiple people talk about how inventory has grown about 20%, and demand is growing around 13%. I think that’s across the industry, and everybody is seeing it.” One reason for this trend could be fragmentation. Another could simply be how easy it is to buy adver­tising elsewhere. “Search and social have done a tremendous job mak­ing the buy flow for an advertiser so simple, anybody could log on,” says Comcast’s Babcock. “Digital premi­um video has been 10 times harder to buy than it ever should have been. It’s so different and so much more complex than so many other businesses because it’s 20,000 line items every single month that want $1,000 targeted to three ZIP codes in the U.S. over these 7 days. Trying to do forecasting and optimizations is complex because of just sheer volume.” Babcock says that one of the biggest challenges or­ganizations like Comcast face in 2025 is, “If an ad­vertiser has a million dollars to spend today, how do they get it into the system and running tomorrow? Be­cause right now, that level of automation is not there. Do they have video creative that is transcoded to the right specs? Is it approved? What publishers can it run on? What pace do they need? Those are the things that we’re working on automating this year,” she says. One way Comcast is addressing this issue is through partnerships like the ad tech platform deal the company’s FreeWheel expanded with Roku in De­cember 2024. “That wouldn’t have existed 5 years ago because everybody looked at each other as competi­tion,” Babcock says. “Now we’re realizing the compe­tition isn’t so much ourselves—it’s search and social that have made the buying so easy.” In addition to the ease of buying on search and so­cial, finding the target audience has become much harder, since consumers have a bounty of choice. “It’s such a fragmented landscape,” says Sarah Monahan, co-head of enterprise ad sales at Roku. “Sports is just one example where it used to be a very straightfor­ward path to find my NBA game, and now there are so many passive entries and also so many different platforms, apps, OSs, and ways to access my content. I’m unclear what my consumer is doing. We spent a lot of time educating our advertising community on this household shift [where viewers] cut the cord. Be­lieve it or not, 88% of their time was spent watching completely free ad-supported content.” Another trend that continued to ramp up in 2024 was programmatic buying, in which automated buy­ing, based on data, budgets, and opportunity, can be handled much more efficiently for many advertising buys. Nearly all large and many smaller companies have a self-serve programmatic offering. Disney an­nounced in 2024 that 50% of its inventory is bought this way, and the company is targeting it to reach 75% by 2027. NBCUniversal had programmatic sales available for the 2024 Paris Olympics. In addition, the company claims to use generative AI to analyze content across its portfolio, paired with its first-party datasets, to pro­duce emotion-based, AI-powered audience segments. As previously mentioned, in December 2024, Roku announced that it expanded its programmatic part­nership with FreeWheel to make Roku content, in­cluding The Roku Channel, available to FreeWheel partners via the Roku Exchange. This will enable real-time bidding among programmatic platforms, with the intent to offer advertisers more of the audiences they are looking for. Location, location, location. CTV operating system companies that are lucky enough to have a home screen environment to sell are continuing to opti­mize their real estate. Home screen ads “are the bulk of our inventory,” says Chris Hock, Whale TV’s VP of monetization. “When you turn on the TV and you get to the home screen, there’s a big, beautiful masthead that takes over the upper portion of the screen, with some kind of navigation overlay under it. That’s a great placement opportunity.” Home screen display ads in LG webOS While this inventory has been around for a while, the type of companies buying it has changed. “The home screen is an entry point that 120 million peo­ple a day see in the U.S.,” says Roku’s Monahan. “For the first time in 2024, we started to allow advertisers to integrate into our home screen in a way that we had not before. It had been historically really limit­ed to M&E. In Q4, a lot of our streamers saw really interesting brand experiences funded by Macy’s for Cyber Monday.” “What we’ve been doing for a long time for interac­tive program guides,” says Craig Chinn, TiVo’s SVP of advertising sales for the Americas, is to “have banners within linear channels. As people are looking through their channels, they can actually click on those inter­active program guide banners and find things that they’re going to do on our homepage hero ad.” The one thing all of these companies have in com­mon is that this inventory is exclusive and a direct buy. “IAB Tech Lab has started to do some work around CTV formats where this masthead ad will stick out and get some specifications around it so it’s easier to buy across different connected TV OSs,” says Hock. These companies and others hold the major proper­ties on the OTT Monopoly board, but let’s turn our at­tention to a few disrupters. These may seem like fringe use cases, but they are an important step in moving the conversation away from “We need change” to “Here’s what change looks like.” A number of companies spoke to me about contex­tual advertising, including Gracenote and Bitmovin. (See more on Bitmovin in The State of Generative AI 2025.) “A lot of the techniques that people have used in browsers to do audience-based advertising are not as effective in CTV,” says Trent Wheeler, Gracenote’s chief product officer. “Contextual can serve both as a way to help to identify the type of content and also to allow more interesting use cases and brand con­nection.” Gracenote launched contextual last year along with Magnite. Customers include Cineverse, DIRECTV Advertising, Philo, Tastemade, and Xumo. “Gracenote Contextual builds on the company’s metadata used for recommendation, but helps pub­lishers position their content to the demand side, to the advertiser market overall,” says Wheeler. “The most straightforward example is live sports con­tent. It is actually very hard to tell in a live sporting event how important or exciting a particular event is. For advertisers, it’s a complex data flow. We will very clearly mark the content, ‘Here’s live sports.’ We can even do things like tell you the score of the game or tell you how close it is. So, if you want to advertise in particularly exciting segments or close segments, those are datasets we could provide.” With the extent of fragmentation in CTV, Wheeler continues, “Audience information is harder to get. There are a lot of different, smaller pockets of in­ventory across CTV. The market is huge. I’ve seen estimates between 30 and 40 billion in regard to CTV advertising, and obviously the promise is, ‘Take what you like about TV advertising and the digital eco­system, and combine them together.’” If you look at TV advertising revenue over the last year, it has been pretty flat. “The best example I have for this is our main customer in Europe called TF1, the biggest channel in Europe,” says Mathias Guille, VP of cloud platform at Broadpeak. “They earn around 1.5 billion euros [annually], and that has been pretty flat for the past 20 years. Business growth is 1%–2% every year. If you compare that to Facebook or Meta in France, every year, they have double-digit growth. How do you explain that difference? TF1 is working with 500 advertisers on TV. Facebook and Meta in France have 500,000 advertisers.” Many companies have thought this same thing and have set up self-serve platforms where SMB buyers can purchase advertising in streaming as easily as you can on social. “If you can bring more advertisers every day to your platform, this is where you get more revenue. They may have smaller budgets, but they bring more growth across the platform,” says Guille. Broadpeak was looking at creating a different type of ad product. “If you have a small budget, you want to pay per click (otherwise called performance marketing),” Guille says. “You don’t want to pay per impression because impressions don’t bring in new conversions. TV needs to bring what we call perfor­mance metrics—it needs actually to tell advertisers the number of clicks, the interest, and what you gen­erate with the ad.” The key challenge, Guille notes, “is to make ads on TV clickable. In the last year, you’ve seen a lot of initia­tives with people putting QR codes on ads, and that’s the first step, because if people can scan the QR code, then you can know how many times they scan the QR code. But that’s not enough.” Guille goes on to say that the QR code is too compli­cated for people to use and that the target should be the click itself. “With a click, especially on the remote, you don’t think about it. You send a notification to your phone; you can look at that later on,” he explains. With­in the SDK used for measurement, viewers can pass the URL for a click. “So, typically, when we request the ad from the ad server, we get the creative, but we also get the URL of the product. The reason that no one is using that on TV today is because there’s nowhere to put that URL. We put that URL into our SSAI.” Amazon is using a similar approach, but instead of targeting SMBs, it targets its own retail platform. When you watch Amazon Prime, there are clickable ads. Instead of sending you a push notification, click­ing on that ad means you can put the advertised prod­uct directly into your Amazon cart. Amazon Prime’s clickable/shoppable ads Edge226 is the developer of Peak, an AI-powered ad tech platform. Boaz Cohen, Edge226’s chief revenue officer, describes the company’s strategy as “bring­ing new advertisers to the TV space. Traditionally, he says, the TV space is all about “brands. In the past 2, 3 years, apps and games have started advertising in the streaming services.” All of a sudden, advertising has another new revenue source. “We are bringing new adver­tisers—apps and games—to the space,” Cohen notes. “That happened because the mea­surement companies in our in­dustry—Adjust, AppsFlyer, Sin­gular, and Branch—added the ability to measure the impact of app downloads on CTV. Once that had happened, advertis­ers who are very much perfor­mance-driven started adding CTV or streaming to their ad­vertising mix.” They either pro­vide a link on mobile or have a call to action to search the app store to download their cus­tomer’s app. “We are definite­ly not buying the $40 Disney or Netflix” ad, Cohen says. “We’re looking at the $6–$10 CPM, sometimes higher, pri­marily running on FAST channels.” New ad formats have also been creeping onto the screen for a while now, e.g., the L-Wrap, which takes two sides of the screen. There is also a two-box shrink­able ad, where the content will continue to play in one screen, and then the ad will be next to it. “I think those are starting to get a lot of buzz and excitement,” says one publisher. L-Wrap advertising in live sports streams “Those do pretty well for sporting events, where they still keep viewers engaged to the screen. Viewers can see some activity in a timeout for example, but also see the ad. They’re probably less effective for binge-watching or episodic entertainment programming,” says Whale TV’s Hock. Two gotchas now: How do you sell these, and how do you measure them? “There’s usually not even an ad for­mat on a lot of these interfaces, so you obviously can’t scale if there’s no nice, automated way to do this,” Hock contends. “It’s still early to see if these formats catch on.” Whale TV is currently offering these new formats to the 300–400 TV manufacturers that use its OS. Two-box shrinkable ads “I’m most excited to lean into optimization, which is in the middle of a flight with a 3-week campaign that’s running,” says Comcast’s Babcock. “The adver­tiser should get an email that says, ‘These appear to be the three most important performance segments that we’re running against. Do you want to double down?’” That option should be available through the click of a button, she notes. “Right now, it’s somebody calling and doing a lot of work.” This seems like an ad tech problem. But realistical­ly, it’s also how business has been done since time im­memorial, so addressing this particular issue seems like a big ask. “We’ve all seen pressure from Amazon coming into the marketplace with Prime Video,” says Philo’s Bark­er. “I think we’ve seen multiple reports talking about how even the big guys like Netflix, Max, and Amazon Prime have dropped their CPMs. I think what is inter­esting about where CPMs are going from a publisher perspective is that there are a lot of people who take a tax along the way. Someone may be buying an ad for a high CPM—let’s say $50—and by the time it gets to us, we may see only half of that because the agency took a cut, the DSP took a cut, the SSP took a cut, the targeting methodology took a cut. By the time we get it, we’re seeing less.” One way Philo is working on this is by hav­ing varying pricing levels available within a programmatic buy. “We’ve just started a programmatic direct deal,” Barker says. “But we probably have 2,000 private market­place deals through our vendors running it at any one time. A lot of them will be priced differently depending on things like trans­parency. We have multiple tiers that we’re all constantly adjusting for different types of advertisers.” “There’s just a finite amount of growth that can come from subscriptions,” states CIMM’s Kee. “On the one hand, we’ll see ad-supported services continue to roll out because people want free stuff.” Regarding a lot of these new formats or approaches, she says, they need to be standardized and scalable. “If a media agency can’t put this in a media plan as a line item and run it through Mediaocean in the same way that they can run something else, then it’s not going to scale.” “2024 was the first time we saw over 50% of 18-to-49-year-olds primarily view their sports—regard­less of the league—on streaming versus linear,” says Roku’s Monahan. Adding live sports to streaming in the past few years has made the transition to stream­ing complete. “I think the dirty secret in buying is everybody’s of­fering all these amazing ways to target, whether it’s contextual or all these IDs. You can send sentiment, all these things that they’re selling,” says Philo’s Reed. “But while it looks great, if you use the Baskin-Robbins analogy, the top sellers are still going to be chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, because people are used to that, and that’s how they do it.” Will advertising face major disruption anytime soon? I have my doubts. This is a long game. I want to cheer each and every small step that disrupts the sta­tus quo, and maybe one day, we will see a new flavor that everyone loves. But remember: It’s not enough to want to change. Can generative AI (gen AI) rip things apart and then try to glue it all back together with more insight, more intelligence, more efficiency, and more value? It really depends on what the application is. Within the video workflow, some tasks are good matches for using gen AI, and others aren't. What does the future of streaming monetization look like? This post-Peak TV media ecosystem is a brave new world, and being able to find the content you want, with the price you want to pay, will likely keep consumers on their toes for years to come. Streaming media business and monetization models expanded and diversified in 2022 and sent a clear message: Paid subscription models were a necessary gateway to widespread streaming adoption, but now ad-supported viewing has a chance to flourish.

Title: A millennial making $280,000 secretly working 2 remote jobs said it's important to get in a rhythm: 'Burnout is real'

After getting laid off four times in four years, Reed was desperate for some level of job security. So he decided to try working two full-time jobs simultaneously. In March 2020, Reed, who's in his 30s and living in New York, was laid off from his strategic operations job in the tech industry. It took him six months to start a new job, but layoffs struck again. His next job lasted less than a month because of the company's financial hardships. By December 2023, he'd lost his fourth job in just over three years. "It was easy to get the jobs because there were jobs out there, but it was hard to keep them," said Reed, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing a fear of professional repercussions. From 2020 to 2023, more than 800,000 tech industry employees across the globe were laid off, according to TrueUp's layoff tracker. Reed said that after the fourth layoff, he had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. This year, Reed is on track to earn about $280,000 secretly working two full-time remote jobs, which pay about $175,000 and $150,000 respectively. With the additional income, he said, he supports his partner — who has been unemployed for three years — helps his parents pay their monthly mortgage, and assists his niece and nephew with their college tuition. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner so we can stay in our apartment and still save money, and do all those adult things that I'm responsible for financially," he said. "I don't really have a choice." Reed is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple remote jobs to boost their incomes. Over the past two years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra earnings to travel the world, buy weight-loss drugs, or simply pay the bills. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. But many job jugglers have told BI the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. After his fourth layoff, Reed started applying for remote jobs, intending to accept two full-time offers if he could get them. In March 2024, he landed his first job. He said looking for another role — between all the applications and interviews — sometimes felt like a second job. In December, he finally achieved his goal and began job juggling for the first time. During his job search, Reed tried to prioritize employers that seemed committed to remote work, but this didn't always go according to plan. Around early September of last year, Reed finished the interview process for a remote position at Amazon. But soon after he'd finished interviewing, Amazon announced that many corporate employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in January. When Reed received a job offer for the role, it was no longer remote: He'd be required to work full time from the nearest office, which he said was about 30 to 40 minutes away. He decided to decline the offer and, in December, accepted a remote position with another company. While other companies have also announced return-to-office policies, Reed feels confident his two current jobs will remain remote. To his knowledge, neither company has ever had a mandatory in-office policy. Reed's typical workweek is about 60 hours, he said, but he does some of his work in the evenings and on weekends. He said that while juggling two jobs could be very stressful at times, he'd found some ways to manage this stress. He gets up earlier than he needs to so he can prepare for the workday ahead, but he still makes sure to get enough sleep — he said it's easier to manage stress when he's well-rested. Additionally, rather than switching between his two work laptops every few minutes, Reed tries to focus on one job for an extended period of time before pivoting to the other. "I have to take breaks in the middle of the day to be able to decipher between one of the two jobs because it does get a little overwhelming," he said. Reed said he has an advantage that many job jugglers don't have: He generally doesn't have to worry about having two meetings scheduled at the same time. That's because he usually schedules the meetings he has to attend. He said he blocks off his meeting times for one job on the other job's calendar, which helps him reduce his chances of getting double-booked. "It has been way more manageable than I thought it was going to be," he said of job juggling. "If you can get into a rhythm of how it works and get organized with how you do the work, it's totally possible to do." Reed said that over the past couple of years, it had taken him longer to land job offers. He thinks this is because many of the remote roles he's applied for have hundreds of applicants — and the interview process has become more extensive. "I used to be able to do two, three interviews max and you would get an offer," he said. "Now it's like a hiring screen, a take-home test, a panel, you have to do a presentation — there are like six or seven steps." Looking ahead, Reed said he had no plans to stop job juggling. He doesn't think it's sustainable long-term, but with his partner still looking for work, he can't afford to stop now. "For now, I'm giving myself a three-to-five-year window," he said. "Because burnout is real. It's going to happen eventually." ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Title: 'MBA is costliest course for teaching nothing': Consultant drops a brutal truth bomb

Feedback A senior manager at a consultancy firm, Manab Majumdar, dropped a provocative reality check about MBAs, stirring significant debate on LinkedIn: "MBA is the costliest course for teaching nothing. Yes, you can learn every subject taught in an MBA at 1/100 cost." The blunt assessment arrives amidst a rapidly shifting job market where traditional assumptions about MBA programs are being dismantled. Majumdar didn't stop there, adding, "Post MBA, you don't become the CXO of the company. Bollywood ka movie dekh k MBA wala fantasy jo hain, wo galat hain." Indeed, dreams of instant executive roles after graduation are increasingly proving unrealistic. CA Nitin Kaushik (@Finance_Bareek) on X echoed this sentiment sharply: "𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling." Even premier institutions like Harvard aren't insulated. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted an unsettling statistic: 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 graduates were unemployed three months after graduation, a dramatic increase from 10% just two years earlier. Stanford and Wharton, too, have reported similar declines, with unemployment nearing 20%. Globally, the picture isn't brighter. According to the International Labour Organization, youth unemployment stood at an alarming 13% in 2023, affecting approximately 65 million young individuals worldwide. Why are MBAs struggling despite attractive median starting salaries exceeding $175,000? The answer lies partly in evolving corporate strategies. Firms like McKinsey, BCG, Google, and Amazon have sharply curtailed MBA hiring amid economic downturns and layoffs. Simultaneously, the corporate world is shifting toward smaller, specialized teams, boosted by the rise of AI and automation, making generalized MBA skills less relevant. Kristen Fitzpatrick, head of career development at Harvard Business School, starkly observes, "Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator." Instead, specialized technical skills are increasingly coveted. In response, business schools are pivoting rapidly. Harvard is now experimenting with AI-powered tools designed to match students to jobs and suggest tailored courses to bridge skills gaps. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: Panama Port Deal Puts Hong Kong Businesses at a Crossroads
URL: https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/panama-port-deal-puts-hong-kong-businesses-at-a-crossroads/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T01:59:18Z
Full Content:
Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Exchange Square, which houses the offices of Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The ownership of two key ports along the Panama Canal has become a major flashpoint between the United States and China. At the heart of the showdown is the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings and its subsidiary, Hutchison Ports. Controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison owns two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the canal is “operated by China” and called for the United States to “take back” control. He has even reportedly ordered the U.S. military to explore options to secure “unfettered” access to the canal. To “de-risk” from the geopolitical contention, CK Hutchison reached a $19 billion deal to sell its expansive overseas port businesses to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock in early March. While this deal might make commercial sense for the company, Beijing is reluctant to cede ownership of these ports due to their strategic value and may intervene to stop the deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was enraged that CK Hutchison didn’t seek Beijing’s approval in advance, and Bloomberg has reported that Chinese regulatory agencies have been instructed to scrutinize the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. State-run Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, commonly regarded as a Beijing mouthpiece, published a series of articles accusing the company of being “profit-seeking and unrighteous,” warning that “dancing with” U.S. politicians would lead to “the condemnation of history.” China’s government amplified that messaging when the Chinese Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted the articles on its own website. This backlash reflects Beijing’s increasingly uneasy relationship with Hong Kong’s business elites. Despite the waves of securitization in recent years, the Chinese party-state still lacks formal channels of influence vis-a-vis Hong Kong businesses, and the port sale has only deepened the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s suspicion toward Hong Kong’s capitalist class. While Beijing has long co-opted local businesses to govern Hong Kong – a strategy pioneered by the British colonial government – it has become increasingly distrustful of their autonomy, profit-driven motives, and lack of patriotism. Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to direct Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Is CK Hutchison part of “China, Inc.”? Due to Hong Kong’s weakening autonomy, some Western commentators increasingly view the city as indistinguishable from China. However, enterprises based in Hong Kong and mainland China still fundamentally differ in their susceptibility to Beijing’s influence. Thus, while a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings has operated the ports in Balboa and Cristóbal since 1997, Trump’s claim that China controls the Panama Canal is misleading. Unlike typical participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative or other overseas infrastructure projects, CK Hutchison is not a state-owned enterprise (SOE). It is a private company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its institutional makeup is international. Next to the Li Ka-shing family’s 30 percent share, U.S.-based BlackRock (5 percent), the Vanguard group (2.78 percent), and the Norges Bank Investment Management (1.18 percent) are among its main institutional shareholders. Additionally, its board of directors has a notably international profile, with most members having backgrounds in Anglophone countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Operating by standard international corporate practices, CK Hutchison is more transparent and commercially driven than state-run firms that own or operate the other ports in China’s network. The company’s success story reflects a “Hong Kong” – rather than Chinese – ethos, mirroring the city’s rise as an international business hub during the colonial era. Before Li Ka-shing purchased a controlling interest in 1979, Hutchison was one of the oldest and most prominent British-owned merchant houses operating in the colony, specializing in export trade, dockyards, and shipping. Under Li’s leadership, Hutchison expanded its international footprint, becoming the world’s largest independent port operator, acquiring Husky Oil in Canada, and establishing mobile phone operations in Australia, Europe, and the United States. This trajectory contrasts with that of mainland China-based companies and SOEs, whose success is often tied to close cooperation with the CCP leadership and access to state support. CK Hutchison’s position as a Hong Kong-based company insulates it from the established toolkit used by the Chinese party-state to discipline Chinese companies. For instance, the CCP influences Chinese businesses and SOEs through the party committees embedded in each firm. Under Xi Jinping, the role of party committees has been strengthened and institutionalized, with Xi calling for the integration of party leadership in “all aspects of corporate governance.” The party committee chairman now also chairs the board of directors of SOEs, allowing the CCP to take over many aspects of the board’s functions in corporate governance. Importantly, these changes have been implemented not only in wholly or partially state-owned firms, but also in the private sector. These mechanisms allow the CCP to intervene in Chinese enterprises’ decision-making, ensuring that these enterprises align with the party’s political objectives. CK Hutchison’s governance structure does not have a party committee. As a result, Beijing lacks any direct institutional channels to influence CK Hutchison’s decision-making. While Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the chairman of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, has developed ties with the CCP through his position on the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP’s influence over the company remains weakly institutionalized. Recent reports that China’s highest leadership has summoned Victor Li to discuss the port deal underscore the informal nature of Beijing’s pressure. Hong Kong’s de jure autonomy further complicates Beijing’s ability to pressure CK Hutchison. When China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, it promised to let the city operate with “a high degree of autonomy” and maintain its independent judicial system, meaning that Chinese national security laws do not automatically apply. Until recently, the party-state had preferred indirect means to influence Hong Kong politics, including through ad hoc legal interpretations of the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), political influence via proxies like the Central Government Liaison Office, and the cultivation of strategic partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. Following mass protests in 2019, Beijing institutionalized its control over Hong Kong and localized its national security policies within the Hong Kong legal system by introducing legislation such as the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) and Article 23 of the Basic Law in 2024. Still, these new legal instruments are primarily aimed at dismantling Hong Kong’s civil society and political opposition rather than disciplining businesses. The government has repeatedly assured the private sector they can conduct business as usual. Among the NSL cases brought against companies, pro-democracy media outlets and organizations with significant links with prominent activists were the main targets. As Mark L. Clifford, a former board member of a media company targeted by the NSL, remarked, “It’s one thing to go after Jimmy Lai and Apple Daily, but quite another to go after ‘Superman’ KS Li and his companies, the most successful international business H.K. has ever produced.” The Challenge of Disciplining Hong Kong Capitalists Beijing’s calculus in attempting to induce or coerce CK Hutchison to collaborate with its national security agenda involves two countervailing logics. On the one hand, Beijing and Hong Kong leaders want to avoid a heavy-handed approach to restore confidence in the city’s business environment and woo foreign investment and talent. They want to convince the world that businesses will not be coerced into forgoing commercial interests in favor of national security, especially after the passage of the NSL and Article 23. The Hong Kong government has vigorously campaigned to rehabilitate Hong Kong’s image after its brutal crackdown on civil society and to dispel suggestions that Beijing controls the city. While the NSL’s prohibitions against “collusion with foreign forces” could in theory apply to CK Hutchison, pursuing such charges against a major Hong Kong conglomerate would be unprecedented and highly destabilizing. A potential intervention by Chinese regulatory agencies – along the lines suggested by Bloomberg – would further undermine Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and business confidence, as China does not have formal regulatory authorities over this “purely commercial” deal. The desire to portray Hong Kong as “open for business” explains why Chief Executive John Lee equivocated when asked whether the NSL would apply to the port sale. The fact that China’s central propaganda outlets and government offices have avoided directly condemning the deal – relying instead on fanning public opinion on social media – suggests Xi Jinping is still weighing his options. On the other hand, Beijing does not feel confident entrusting crucial maritime assets to a private Hong Kong company. Since assuming power in 2012, Xi has repeatedly expressed his ambition to “construct a strong sea power,” viewing this as vital to realizing his wider “China dream” of national rejuvenation. This entails not only the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army Navy but also heavy investments in China’s maritime industry. The U.S. Trade Representative recently accused Beijing of seeking to cultivate global trade dependence on China through strategic investments in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While the Chinese government has used SOEs and other proxies in these strategically significant industries to push its maritime strategy, CK Hutchison’s overseas port operation remains a notable exception to the “China, Inc.” approach. According to data collected by MERICS, among the 78 ports with Chinese or Hong Kong ownership or operations, Hutchison operates terminals in 33, outnumbering even China’s SOEs – 26 terminals are operated by China Merchants Group, 19 by COSCO, and 19 by others. The Chinese leadership is rethinking allowing a private Hong Kong company to control such a critical component of its maritime strategy, as well as its broader partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. To stabilize China’s indirect rule in Hong Kong and secure Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub, Beijing has long relied on a ruling coalition formed with local elites, including the business sector. For instance, before the reform of the “patriots only” electoral system in 2021, the functional constituencies (FCs) – elected by members of corporations or registered professional bodies – had constituted half of the seats within Hong Kong’s legislative body. The FCs have served as a reliable counterbalance against democrats in the directly elected geographical constituencies by opposing any attempt to democratize Hong Kong, which they saw as a potential threat to their business interests. However, decades of partnership between Beijing and Hong Kong’s local business elite belie a degree of mutual distrust and suspicion. The Hong Kong capitalists are interested in maintaining close ties with Beijing to exploit economic opportunities in China, but some of them are also wary of China’s more assertive and interventionist approach to the economy. Beijing has been suspicious of Hong Kong businesspeople’s profit-driven motives and “lack of patriotism” as potential obstacles to its political agenda in Hong Kong. The rift between Beijing and Hong Kong business elites became visible in the 2010s. The chief executive election in 2012 was an early indication: within the Election Committee, local tycoons – including Li Ka-shing – backed Henry Tang Ying-yen, the son of a Hong Kong industrialist originating from Shanghai, while Beijing favored Leung Chun-ying, a long-time Beijing loyalist, at the last minute and got him elected. Li in particular has drawn Beijing’s suspicion for “unpatriotic” business decisions and speeches before. Since 2013, Li has gradually moved his assets out of Hong Kong and China, including relocating his flagship company from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands and selling a major commercial complex in Shanghai in 2016. A state-affiliated Chinese think tank viewed his divestment as a betrayal, accusing him of being “ungrateful” for state support in building Hutchison’s real estate business in China and abandoning the country at the first sign of economic trouble in the 2010s. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, Chinese state media singled out Li for not making his stance on the protests clear. At the height of the mass protests in September 2019, Li even publicly appealed to the government to show mercy to the young people. Therefore, beyond salvaging the strategic value of CK Hutchison’s port businesses, the CCP has the incentive to make an example of Li to assert its dominance over Hong Kong’s freewheeling capitalists. This is why Beijing’s mouthpieces have appealed to anti-American nationalist sentiments and ramped up the rhetorical pressure on the Li family, even though the actual strategic costs are likely less acute than the frequent invocation of “national security” by propagandists and Hong Kong’s political figures suggests. The mounting political pressure will serve as a warning signal to Hong Kong’s disloyal business elites. What’s Next? Beijing’s vociferous response to the CK Hutchison port sale has already had a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s business elites. While Hutchison’s port holdings represent a distinct strategic value for Beijing’s maritime strategy, as Xi expands the definition of national security, more sectors in Hong Kong may find themselves in a similar situation. Businesses could feel compelled to align with the political goals of the Chinese leadership, limiting their autonomy in pursuing commercial interests. Any intervention by Beijing not only validates Trump’s allegation about the strategic role of Hong Kong businesses to China, but also sets a precedent for further encroachments on Hong Kong’s private sector. Even if Beijing refrains from directly blocking the Panama ports deal, the underlying issue remains: Hong Kong’s business community still operates with a level of autonomy that Beijing increasingly finds unacceptable. Going forward, China will likely seek to reduce such autonomy, focusing on bringing strategic assets held by Hong Kong firms – including overseas ports and beyond – more directly under Beijing’s influence. The question is no longer whether Beijing will act, but how far it is willing to go.

Title: CoreWeave’s IPO priced lower than expected, at $40 per share, valuing it at $19B

UPDATED 21:34 EDT / MARCH 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Updated Friday with market reaction: Shares of CoreWeave Inc. fell more than 5% in their stock market debut Friday morning despite the company downsizing its offer and stock price late Thursday, but by the close it had recouped losses to close 2.5% over the initial trade of $39 a share. Investors had been closely watching CoreWeave Inc.’s initial public offering after it priced its shares at just $40, much lower than was originally anticipated. The cloud computing infrastructure company, which trades under the ticker symbol “CRWV,” raised $1.5 billion in the sale Thursday evening, making it the biggest U.S. tech issue since 2021. Its offering was seen as a bellwether for investors’ appetite for IPOs, which have been in a deep freeze for years now. CNBC reported that CoreWeave, which provides access to cloud-based graphics processing units for artificial intelligence workloads, had first targeted a price of between $47 and $55 per share. That would have valued it at around $26.5 billion based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding and raised about $1 billion more. However, the offering has been reduced from 49 million shares to just 37.5 million, according to one anonymous source quoted by Bloomberg, which was the first to report the $40 price. It means CoreWeave’s valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though its market capitalization will remain higher on a fully diluted basis. According to CNBC, CoreWeave has still managed to attract some prestigious backers at that price, with Nvidia Corp. set to buy up $250 million worth of shares at the $40 price. The company had been hoping to capitalize on the rising demand for AI computing resources and the broader trend that has seen investors throw billions of dollars at AI startups. Buoyed by its close proximity to a number of AI industry leaders, CoreWeave highlighted in its IPO prospectus how its revenue had jumped seven times in the last year. But as investors looked more closely at the company’s business model, a number of concerns emerged. The company is reliant on two major customers that account for 77% of its total revenue, and it has estimated that it will need to spend billions of dollars in capital to keep up with Nvidia’s two-year GPU refresh lifecycle. A report by London’s Financial Times earlier this week dented CoreWeave’s prospects when it said that Microsoft, which provides around two-thirds of its revenue, had gone back on some of its commitments due to issues around delivery and deadlines. CoreWeave pushed back, saying the report was “false and misleading,” but it only intensified concerns some investors have that big technology companies may be overspending on AI. In the last few weeks, several analysts have noted that Microsoft appears to be scaling back on its data center investment plans. And last month, Amazon Web Services Inc., the biggest cloud infrastructure company of all, also appeared to reduce some of its near-term spending plans. Investors also noted that CoreWeave’s capital spending plans cannot be funded by its existing revenue, even after it added OpenAI as its third major customer earlier this month. It’s currently sitting on $12 billion in debt, and that’s expected to grow to about $21 billion by the end of the year. Writing in his column in The Information, the financial market analyst Cory Weinberg revealed that investors he has talked to have shared concerns regarding the proportion of CoreWeave’s revenue that’s tied to Microsoft and Nvidia. There are other alarm bells too. “They worry about CoreWeave’s founders having sold so much stock already,” Weinberg wrote. “They worry about how much cash the company expects to burn.” EquityZen analyst Phil Haslett told The Street there are also concerns about the broader macroeconomic uncertainties in the economy, plus questions about the strength of AI demand, putting the onus on CoreWeave to tell a more convincing story to investors. “It’s a unique business model that needs to find the right positioning,” Haslett said. “Hyperscalers may decide to build out their own infrastructure (like Meta Platforms), but smaller tech companies could still need a scalable solution (that CoreWeave provides).” CoreWeave’s decision to lower both its share price and the number of shares it plans to sell may be an attempt to find that positioning. But although the lower price may make its stock seem more enticing, it’s not clear if it will be low enough to convince market naysayers, and apparently there are a lot of them. In his column, Weinberg said he had read the results of a confidential survey of 135 investors from an investment bank not involved in the IPO. It revealed that 90% of respondents didn’t believe CoreWeave had a “sustainable moat,” meaning they don’t consider it a sustainable long-term investment. “One respondent summed up a broader perception about CoreWeave: ‘It’s radioactive, and I think every investor knows that,’” Weinberg wrote. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE the concerns over CoreWeave’s overexposure to Microsoft are justified, but believes there’s still a great market opportunity for a dedicated AI cloud platform if it gets the execution right. “Without a firm commitment from Microsoft, it remains a risk, but it might still be worth a shot for some investors,” he added. CoreWeave’s debut is being watched keenly by the wider tech industry, for the IPO is seen as a major test for the market’s readiness for a new wave of stock offerings. IPOs have been few and far between since 2022, with rising interest rates and soaring inflation dampening investor enthusiasm for risky bets. The last technology company that raised more than $1 billion through an IPO was Freshworks Inc. back in 2021, and last year, both Rubrik Inc. and Reddit Inc. raised about $750 million via their offerings. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s election victory last November, many analysts said they expect to see renewed IPO activity.

Title: CoreWeave prices IPO lower than expected, and its stock still sags on its debut before recovering

UPDATED 21:34 EDT / MARCH 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Updated Friday with market reaction: Shares of CoreWeave Inc. fell more than 5% in their stock market debut Friday morning despite the company downsizing its offer and stock price late Thursday, but by the close it had recouped losses to close 2.5% over the initial trade of $39 a share. Investors had been closely watching CoreWeave Inc.’s initial public offering after it priced its shares at just $40, much lower than was originally anticipated. The cloud computing infrastructure company, which trades under the ticker symbol “CRWV,” raised $1.5 billion in the sale Thursday evening, making it the biggest U.S. tech issue since 2021. Its offering was seen as a bellwether for investors’ appetite for IPOs, which have been in a deep freeze for years now. CNBC reported that CoreWeave, which provides access to cloud-based graphics processing units for artificial intelligence workloads, had first targeted a price of between $47 and $55 per share. That would have valued it at around $26.5 billion based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding and raised about $1 billion more. However, the offering has been reduced from 49 million shares to just 37.5 million, according to one anonymous source quoted by Bloomberg, which was the first to report the $40 price. It means CoreWeave’s valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though its market capitalization will remain higher on a fully diluted basis. According to CNBC, CoreWeave has still managed to attract some prestigious backers at that price, with Nvidia Corp. set to buy up $250 million worth of shares at the $40 price. The company had been hoping to capitalize on the rising demand for AI computing resources and the broader trend that has seen investors throw billions of dollars at AI startups. Buoyed by its close proximity to a number of AI industry leaders, CoreWeave highlighted in its IPO prospectus how its revenue had jumped seven times in the last year. But as investors looked more closely at the company’s business model, a number of concerns emerged. The company is reliant on two major customers that account for 77% of its total revenue, and it has estimated that it will need to spend billions of dollars in capital to keep up with Nvidia’s two-year GPU refresh lifecycle. A report by London’s Financial Times earlier this week dented CoreWeave’s prospects when it said that Microsoft, which provides around two-thirds of its revenue, had gone back on some of its commitments due to issues around delivery and deadlines. CoreWeave pushed back, saying the report was “false and misleading,” but it only intensified concerns some investors have that big technology companies may be overspending on AI. In the last few weeks, several analysts have noted that Microsoft appears to be scaling back on its data center investment plans. And last month, Amazon Web Services Inc., the biggest cloud infrastructure company of all, also appeared to reduce some of its near-term spending plans. Investors also noted that CoreWeave’s capital spending plans cannot be funded by its existing revenue, even after it added OpenAI as its third major customer earlier this month. It’s currently sitting on $12 billion in debt, and that’s expected to grow to about $21 billion by the end of the year. Writing in his column in The Information, the financial market analyst Cory Weinberg revealed that investors he has talked to have shared concerns regarding the proportion of CoreWeave’s revenue that’s tied to Microsoft and Nvidia. There are other alarm bells too. “They worry about CoreWeave’s founders having sold so much stock already,” Weinberg wrote. “They worry about how much cash the company expects to burn.” EquityZen analyst Phil Haslett told The Street there are also concerns about the broader macroeconomic uncertainties in the economy, plus questions about the strength of AI demand, putting the onus on CoreWeave to tell a more convincing story to investors. “It’s a unique business model that needs to find the right positioning,” Haslett said. “Hyperscalers may decide to build out their own infrastructure (like Meta Platforms), but smaller tech companies could still need a scalable solution (that CoreWeave provides).” CoreWeave’s decision to lower both its share price and the number of shares it plans to sell may be an attempt to find that positioning. But although the lower price may make its stock seem more enticing, it’s not clear if it will be low enough to convince market naysayers, and apparently there are a lot of them. In his column, Weinberg said he had read the results of a confidential survey of 135 investors from an investment bank not involved in the IPO. It revealed that 90% of respondents didn’t believe CoreWeave had a “sustainable moat,” meaning they don’t consider it a sustainable long-term investment. “One respondent summed up a broader perception about CoreWeave: ‘It’s radioactive, and I think every investor knows that,’” Weinberg wrote. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE the concerns over CoreWeave’s overexposure to Microsoft are justified, but believes there’s still a great market opportunity for a dedicated AI cloud platform if it gets the execution right. “Without a firm commitment from Microsoft, it remains a risk, but it might still be worth a shot for some investors,” he added. CoreWeave’s debut is being watched keenly by the wider tech industry, for the IPO is seen as a major test for the market’s readiness for a new wave of stock offerings. IPOs have been few and far between since 2022, with rising interest rates and soaring inflation dampening investor enthusiasm for risky bets. The last technology company that raised more than $1 billion through an IPO was Freshworks Inc. back in 2021, and last year, both Rubrik Inc. and Reddit Inc. raised about $750 million via their offerings. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s election victory last November, many analysts said they expect to see renewed IPO activity. But the imposition of multiple tariffs has instead shocked the global economy, creating uncertainty that could dissuade investors from betting on new offerings. A number of technology firms have filed to go public later this year, including the ticketing marketplace StubHub Inc., digital health startup Hinge Health Inc., financial platform eToro Inc. and the online lender Klarna Group Plc.

Jana Small Finance Bank expands to Andhra Pradesh with first branch in Guntur, offering diverse financial services. The Indian government is becoming more dependent on household savings to handle its rising debt, with around $346 billion in sovereign bonds due over the next five years. By tapping into trusted instruments like G-Secs and small savings schemes, the government aims to reduce dependence on foreign capital and stabilize public finances. However, this strategy comes with its own risks. While short-term deposits under the (GMS) Gold Monetization Scheme will continue at the banks’ discretion, the discontinuation of new enrollments emphasizes the ongoing struggle to convince households to monetize their gold. Regardless of efforts to cut down on gold imports and boost liquidity, participation in the scheme remains low. Over-dependence on domestic savings could also restrict funds existing for private sector investments, possibly slowing long-term economic growth. With household savings on the decline and government debt on the rise, maintaining this approach may prove difficult. Striking the right balance between managing public debt and fostering private sector growth will be key to sustaining economic stability and development. Robust core markets to drive higher EBITDA — upgrade to Buy; lift TP to INR34,000 Valuation: upgrade to Buy; raise TP by 21% to INR34,000 (19% implied upside). We had turned Neutral on Shree in Jan’25 largely on account of weakness in its core markets; however, the recent recovery in core markets and higher utilization should result in market share gain for Shree, in our view. As a result, we raise our FY26F/27F volume estimates by 5%/7% to 41MT/46MT on account of its improved utilization in the Northern and Eastern regions (>80% of volume mix). Furthermore, both regions have witnessed resilient pricing, up 4% q-q, compared to only 2% pan-India. We increase our FY26F/27F EBITDA by 9%/15% to INR49bn/INR65bn from INR45bn/INR56bn, largely reflecting the company’s improved cement realizations and utilization in core markets. Our FY26F/27F EBITDA are 1%/11% above Bloomberg consensus. We expect Shree to remain the highest unitary EBITDA player in the industry.

Latest data suggest that the recent introduction of US tariffs has driven up manufacturing input prices and risks exacerbating supply chain frictions. This week’s flash PMI surveys from the US, Europe and Japan contained mixed evidence about the current plight of the world economy. The US economy maintained some decent momentum in March at the same time as Europe’s growth rate has picked up pace. Japan in contrast saw some marked weakening in its headline composite PMI, suggesting a big loss of momentum. As above chart suggests US factories reported the steepest rise in input costs for 31 months, causing the rate of inflation to far outpace equivalent rates reported in the other G4 economies. Despite these challenges, US corporate profits surged to a record high in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand and pricing power. Profits from current production, with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose by $204.7 billion, or 5.4%, reaching an all-time high of $4 trillion. . On the macroeconomic front, the US GDP growth rate has slowed, coming in at 2.4%—slightly above the forecasted 2.3% but significantly lower than the previous 3.1%. Meanwhile, the goods trade deficit narrowed by 4.9% to $147.9 billion in February, as exports rose by $7 billion to $178.6 billion, while imports dipped by $0.6 billion to $326.5 billion. In Asia, Taiwan is exploring multiple options to respond to potential new US tariffs. Officials indicated that the country may increase energy imports and reduce its own tariffs to rebalance bilateral trade. Meanwhile, Japan’s core consumer price index (CPI) for of Tokyo rose by 2.4% YoY in March, up from 2.2% in February, in line with market expectations. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates unchanged in its March policy meeting, adopting a cautious stance amidst global risks. However, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that further rate hikes could be on the table if economic conditions evolve as projected. On the domestic front, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is preparing to establish a production unit near Hyderabad, marking Telangana as the first Indian state to host a BYD facility. The Telangana government has shortlisted three potential sites near Hyderabad for the proposed plant, as reported by ETV Bharat. In the bond market, the Indian government announced plans to borrow ₹8 trillion in the first half (H1) of FY26, accounting for around 54% of the total gross market borrowing target of ₹14.82 trillion, as per the expectations The plan also includes the issuance of ₹10,000 crore worth of sovereign green bonds (SGBs). Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to double the cap on investments by individual foreign investors in listed companies to 10%, aiming to boost capital inflows. This move will broaden the scope to include all foreign investors, potentially increasing the combined holding limit to 24%, as talks with the government and SEBI continue. Further, India is likely to undertake another round of import duty cuts before April 2. The list may cover four to five products, including select electronics, chemicals, plastics, aircraft, parachutes, and cruise ships, which currently attract duties ranging from 7.5% to 10%.

SEBI has proposed that exchanges should stay with F&O expiry on Tuesday & Thursday. This may mean that NSE reverts to expiry on Thursday (from Monday) & BSE stays with Tuesday expiry.

Mehta Equities Market kya lagta hain@ 7.30am – Friday, March 28th 2025 US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts, a move aimed at boosting domestic automotive manufacturing by incentivizing automakers to invest in the United States. The tariff, effective from April 3, is expected to generate approximately $100 billion annually for the US economy, marking a significant shift in US trade policy. The policy affects not only fully assembled vehicles but also key automotive components such as engines, transmissions, powertrain systems, and electrical assemblies. This decision is likely to disrupt global supply chains, with significant repercussions for India’s auto parts industry, which supplies major US and global automakers. Indian automotive component manufacturers, many of whom are integral to the global supply chain, now face potential cost escalations and trade uncertainties. The increased tariffs could reduce exports to the US, forcing Indian companies to explore alternative markets or establish local manufacturing units within the United States to bypass the tariffs. This policy shift aligns with Trump’s broader “America First” economic agenda, prioritizing domestic production over foreign imports. However, it also raises concerns about rising vehicle prices in the US, potential trade tensions with major auto-exporting nations, and the long-term impact on global automotive investments.

Geopolitical tensions, trade policy uncertainties, volatility in international commodity prices and financial market uncertainties pose considerable risks to India’s economic growth in the next fiscal, however the outlook for inflation remains benign, Ministry of Finance said on March 26. In its Monthly Economic Review for February 2025, the ministry highlighted, “domestic private sector capital formation, focused on India’s solid fundamentals and economic prospects, will be an important driver of economic growth in FY26.” The review pointed out that supportive fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy, and the Union Budget’s focus on longer-term development reforms will strengthen India’s domestic economic resilience amidst significant global uncertainties. India’s economy is expected to grow between 6.3 and 6.8 percent in FY26. On the inflation front, the finance ministry expects food prices to remain benign given estimates of agricultural production. Retail inflation eased to 3.6 percent in February 2025 as food prices eased. The monthly economic review noted that India’s economic performance in the latter half of FY25 was supported by strong agricultural and service sector growth, alongside steady private consumption. The report highlighted that “real GDP and real GVA are estimated to have grown by 6.2 per cent in Q3 FY25. This reflected a rebound in economic activity from Q2 FY25, in which GDP growth was 5.6 per cent.” Growth in the agricultural sector was particularly strong at 4.6 percent in FY25, driven by robust kharif output and positive rabi prospects. India’s fiscal management also remains on track, with the Union Budget 2025-26 laying out a prudent fiscal consolidation path. “The Union Budget 2025-26 announced a cautiously ambitious debt consolidation path that projects union government debt to decline by at least 5.1 percentage points over a six-year period from 2024-25 to 2030-31.” The government maintained a balance between fiscal consolidation, welfare, and growth, ensuring that “there is a close convergence of actual deficits, critical ratios, and essential expenditures with their budget estimates, indicating a sustained commitment to fiscal targets.” Meanwhile, trade performance showed mixed trends. While India’s total exports increased by 6.2 percent year-on-year during April-February FY25, merchandise exports recorded only marginal growth of 0.1 percent, weighed down by weaker petroleum product exports. However, services exports remained resilient, contributing to an overall trade surplus. “India’s exports have recorded softer growth thus far in FY25. However, a robust services trade surplus continues to offset the impact of lower growth in merchandise exports.” Foreign investments saw a decline in net FDI due to increased repatriation and outbound investments. Nonetheless, the finance ministry remains optimistic about India’s capital market resilience, supported by steady fiscal management and policy reforms. “Despite the sell-off by FPIs and heightened global market turbulence, the Rupee continues to be amongst the least volatile currencies as compared to its peers.” India’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Currency Index is expected to further bolster foreign investment in debt markets. Labour market indicators reflected stability, with the urban unemployment rate declining to 6.4 percent in Q3 FY25, accompanied by improvements in labour force participation and workforce expansion. Payroll data from EPFO indicated a net addition of 17.89 lakh members in January 2025, reflecting a continued increase in formal sector employment. The report stated that “various indices and surveys reveal positive sentiments towards hiring.” Despite global uncertainties, the finance ministry reiterated that “strong macroeconomic fundamentals, sustained investment, and policy support would help India navigate external risks while maintaining a steady growth trajectory in the upcoming fiscal year.” HCL Tech: Company partners with Samsung to enhance Semiconductor innovation.

Title: JPMorgan Just Beat Big Tech to a Quantum Breakthrough

Pulling numbered balls out of a mixing machine. Tracking the twitch of a mouse cursor. Converting lava lamp motion into data. These are just a few ways real-world randomness is generated—essential for things like lotteries and Internet encryption, where unpredictability equals security. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Transmitting that randomness over the Internet, however, is a different story. Physically random processes are hard to verify remotely, and by design, traditional computers can’t generate true randomness. But a new quantum breakthrough may have solved the problem. Published yesterday (May 26) in Nature, a study from JPMorgan Chase researchers—alongside collaborators at Argonne and Oak Ridge national labs and the University of Texas at Austin—demonstrates how a quantum computer generates “certified” randomness. Quantum computers don’t use ordinary bits but qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and collapse into intrinsically random outcomes. Using a 56-qubit quantum computer from Quantinuum, the researchers produced random numbers that were then verified by classic supercomputers. “It’s the first experimental demonstration of the use of a quantum computer to generate certified random numbers,” said Scott Aaronson, the UT Austin professor who introduced the randomness protocol used in the study, in an interview with Observer. Quantum computing has attracted increasing attention from tech and financial firms, which hope to use it to solve problems today’s supercomputers cannot. JPMorgan’s Marco Pistoia, head of global tech applied research, called the result a major milestone—not just for quantum hardware but also for fields like statistical sampling, simulation and cryptography. Even so, certified randomness won’t be hitting your phone tomorrow. Aaronson noted that verifying the results is still costly. “I don’t expect this to be an application that changes the world,” he said. “But it is one of the first uses of a quantum computer for anything that I couldn’t say for certain is useless.” JPMorgan isn’t alone in chasing quantum breakthroughs, which, by some estimates, could grow by $2 trillion in the next 15 years. In early 2025, Google (GOOGL) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that completes in five minutes a benchmark task that would take today’s best supercomputers 10 septillion years. In February, Microsoft (MSFT) created its Majorana 1 chip using a rare new state of matter known as a “topological state.” Even Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jensen Huang—who once tanked quantum stocks by questioning the field’s relevance—has softened his stance. Earlier this month, the chipmaking executive walked back his critique while announcing a new Nvidia-backed quantum research facility in Boston.
