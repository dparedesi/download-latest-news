January 21, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

By Julie Zhu and Elisa Martinuzzi DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang met with global finance and business leaders including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon during a private lunch in Davos on Tuesday. The lunch, hosted by World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab, was also attended by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters and Visa (NYSE:V) CEO Ryan Mclnerney. Several Chinese government officials who are part of the country's delegation in Switzerland were also present at the event. U.S. financial firms have been keen to maintain good relations with Beijing, even as Chinese growth has waned. "All the indicators are positive, but the market is waiting to see how much conviction there is and how much follows through," an executive who attended the meeting told Reuters. "There was a determination to complete all the transformations that they (the Chinese) set out," said the executive, adding the key goals for Beijing include stabilizing the property market and stimulating the domestic demand. Chinese policymakers are intensifying efforts to stimulate a faltering economy in the face of concerns over potential U.S. tariff hikes following President Donald Trump's inauguration. Trump unexpectedly held off from imposing tariffs on China on his first day back in the White House. Ding on Tuesday welcomed more investment by foreign companies in the country, adding that China was willing to solve problems encountered by domestic and foreign firms. He is the second-highest-ranking Chinese official to rub shoulders with global business and political leaders at the Davos summit since President Xi Jinping attended in 2017.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks traded in the green on Tuesday, but tech lagged as investors digested President Donald Trump's first policy moves, with future tariffs on Mexico and Canada front of mind. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. But the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was broadly flat as the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) struggled. Wall Street is bracing for volatility as the new president storms ahead with executive orders and actions, with energy and trade center stage. It's the first day of trading in Trump's second term, as US markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Markets got a dose of relief as Trump held off from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes expected by many on his first day in office. China got a surprise reprieve as Trump failed to act on promised high duties on its imports. US stock futures rose, and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) pulled back from a near two-year high on Monday. But the mood shifted after Trump said later in the day that he was looking at imposing 25% duties for Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1. And Chinese stocks (000300.SS) closed out Tuesday with only slight gains, suggesting investors aren't convinced that a US-China reset is coming to avert a trade war. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 4 basis points to around 4.57% early on Tuesday, recovering somewhat from a deeper drop in Asia trading. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a ride, rising to a record higher above $109,000 on Monday as Trump was sworn in and the new president issued an official TRUMP "meme coin" token. The leading digital currency then fell steeply early Tuesday after a hoped-for pro-crypto push failed to appear in the first policy actions. It was trading lower but still above $103,000 at last check. The next batch of quarterly earnings will provide more food for thought for investors. Netflix (NFLX) is expected to deliver strong results when it reports after the bell. Meanwhile, earnings at Charles Schwab (SCHW) soared nearly 50% as trading activity climbed by double digits. D.R. Horton (DHI) also beat expectations despite a soft housing market, while 3M Company (MMM) issued optimistic full-year guidance, driven by organic sales growth. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 4% in early trading Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor. On his first day in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former Democratic President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other EV stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7% while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. US stocks climbed across the board on Tuesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's first wave of executive orders, with future tariffs on China and Mexico at the forefront of stock traders' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed about 0.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech megacaps boosted the overall index. Economic data: No notable economic data releases. Earnings: Netflix (NFLX), 3M Company (MMM), Capital One (COF), Charles Schwab (SCHW), D.R. Horton (DHI), KeyCorp (KEY), Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), United Airlines (UAL), Zions Bancorporation (ZION) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: BofA chief: The Fed may have to respond to Trump Bitcoin holds retreat as Trump omits crypto from Day 1 orders Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 18% in holiday quarter Trump eyes historic 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Investors get set for stock laggards to rally on Trump bets: BofA 3M stock rises as Q4 profit beats estimates on strong demand Huawei seeks to grab market share in AI chips from Nvidia in China Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Acquires Hashnote, a $1.3B Tokenized RWA Firm

Circle, the crypto company behind the $48 billion USDC stablecoin, said Tuesday it has acquired tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer Hashnote. The companies closed the deal this morning, a Circle spokesperson told CoinDesk and was announced in Davos, Switzerland during the annual World Economic Forum meeting. The companies didn't reveal pricing details. Circle aims to integrate USYC with USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, enabling convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains, the press release said. Hashnote issues the $1.3 billion USYC token, which saw massive growth last year to become the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury product on the market, according to rwa.xyz data. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said this marks a significant step toward aligning traditional financial structures with the speed and transparency of blockchain-based markets. "This is a huge unlock for a market that is increasingly being driven by institutional adoption, and where participants increasingly expect market structures that are common in TradFi,” Allaire said. Circle shared plans a year ago to go public, and the crypto industry widely expects the public share offering to happen later this year. The acquisition underscores the synergies between two of the hottest trends in crypto: stablecoins and tokenization. Circle's main stablecoin competitor Tether launched a tokenization platform last year. Stablecoins, a $200 billion asset class of cryptocurrencies with prices pegged predominantly to the U.S. dollar, are a crucial piece of infrastructure in tokenization efforts. They are used as a bridge between fiat money and digital assets and widely used for settling transactions on blockchain rails. Tokenized RWAs like treasury bills and money market funds are quickly gaining traction among sophisticated investors and asset managers as collateral for trading. Unlike in traditional markets, blockchain-based assets promise transparency, accessibility and around-the-clock settlements. Treasury-backed tokens also allow investors to earn a yield while posted as collateral or margin for trades, enhancing returns compared to trades collateralized with fiat money or stablecoins. For example, Singapore-based hedge fund QCP Capital earlier in January executed a bitcoin (BTC) basis trade using BUIDL, the money market fund token issued by BlackRock and Securitize. Circle also announced that it struck a deal with Cumberland, a DRW-affiliated crypto trading firm and market maker, to provide liquidity and facilitate settlements for USDC and USYC. The partnership aims to expand USYC as a form of collateral on exchanges and custodial platforms. Additionally, Circle laid out plans to deploy USDC on the Canton Network, a blockchain used by traditional financial institutions for real-world asset transactions. The integration with Canton would allow for constant liquidity between cash and collateral and allows seamless transfers between decentralized and traditional markets.

Title: TikTok bounces back after ban, is it here to stay?

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. On the second day after the ban, and the day before the new president’s inauguration, TikTok became accessible to users again, having effectively been shut down for just 14 hours. The fiasco leaves one big question: will TikTok stay for good? Why it matters: TikTok’s return to operation after its ban, though brief, raises larger questions about its future in the US. As one of the world’s most popular apps, TikTok’s business model, its relationship with global users, and its ownership structure have come under intense scrutiny. The app’s survival hinges on a combination of political maneuvering, legal challenges, and complex dynamics between US and Chinese interests. The app has become a focal point of broader geopolitical tensions, leaving its future anything but assured. Details: After being shut down for about 14 hours, TikTok was revived on Sunday and thanked Trump for assuring TikTok and its business partners that they would not face hefty fines for keeping the app running. The app began operating again on Monday, but TikTok was still unavailable for download in the Apple and Google app stores. Trump also stated on social media platform X that he would sign an order to “save” the software. So, what does saving TikTok entail? Context: The TikTok ban debate in the US stems from national security concerns, driven by allegations that the app could potentially allow the Chinese government to access US user data. In response, then-President Trump signed executive orders aimed at banning the app unless it was sold to a US company. At the beginning of his second term, he made an about-turn to become a proponent of keeping the app, positioning himself as the only person with the potential to put into effect meaningful change. With a small team, TechNode provides timely news and thoughtfully researched articles for worldwide readers interested in learning more about the Chinese tech industry.

Title: Sure, I’d love to work in an office with ‘masculine energy’
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2025/01/21/sure-i-d-love-work-office-with-masculine-energy
Time Published: 2025-01-21T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement January 21, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min ​Freelance creative Julie Seal, among other things, used to work at Meta. She was particularly interested in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s call for “masculine energy” in the workplace. Here, she explores the good and the bad aspects of what that could mean. I’d love to work in a place with masculine energy. “Sheryl hired great people and taught me how to run a company. She deserves credit for so much of what Meta is today,” said Zuckerberg in 2024. A few months later, he’s saying his former colleague is responsible for the diversity and the ‘culture issue’ brought about by Sheryl’s ‘feminine energy.’ But I think he’s right to do so. Personally, I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy.’ To plunge into the clichés, he could mean cutthroat and merciless, lunchtime arm wrestles and willy-swinging competitions, maybe actual shooting range target practice and MMA ‘team-building’ sessions, lunches of only red meat, protein shakes (or red meat protein shakes) and coffee with melted butter. Some of you will be more familiar with the more British version, office floors exchanging shouty ‘bants,’ copious lunchtime, after work, cheeky bottom-drawer booze-bonding and ‘man-up’ ‘mickey-taking.’ Maybe it’s like a dating app office I once went for a meeting at where there were photos of naked women on the walls, and the only female employees in hundreds were the high-heeled hot receptionists. (They wanted to attract more women to the app, hence my being invited to help them. Lol). Or maybe it’s more like the now disgraced fast-fashion mogul who I saw in a meeting publicly berate every member of his staff, including his son, before slipping his hand too far down my back a number of times on the way out. Or the ‘masculine energy’ I first experienced at work was when I worked for my dad in the school holidays from the age of eight. I valeted the cars he bought written off and did up, or we did painting and decorating. I worked 8-4pm every day and got £5 a week (and a daily fry up at a truck caff) for the pleasure. His masculine energy mainly meant being tight and saying very little of anything. Later, I experienced the ‘masculine energy’ of working in a very rough estate pub (underage at 16), where I was placed in the middle of the daily fights to ensure they’d stop as “nobody would punch the little blonde girl.” I learned how to deal with perving, leering, requests to take photos of my feet for a fetish mag, filthy comments constantly sprinkled around the commonplace violence. Advertisement When I ran my own pub at 20 (the youngest landlady the company ever had), the ‘masculine energy’ came from every delivery man who asked for the manager, incredulous and low-key furious it could be me. In advertising, the ‘masculine energy’ was different. This was a professional office environment, so the aggression was passive, with each of the three founders hating and trying to undermine each other in more sophisticated ways than pinning each other up against the toilet cistern. We collected their drugs from the local butcher along with the sausage roll order, and that helped fuel the ‘masculine energy’ nicely (while I was being sent laminated sticky photos of myself from a stalker who worked in the neighboring offices). In fact, Mark’s right, ‘feminine energy’ actually only really hit when I started work at Meta back in 2016. Sheryl seemed equally in charge, women were encouraged to ‘lean in’, they were respected and in positions of power, and people seemed to care about soft skills and the welfare of the workforce not just stock price. Advertisement One of my early managers, an American powerhouse of ambition mixed with kindness was something totally new to me then. My male manager was the same. He was understanding, he listened, he had empathy and a heart. And as a result, we felt valued, worked harder, and smarter. So weird, right? So when I say I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy,’ I guess I mean like the men I know and respect most. The masculinity that’s secure in itself enough to champion other people, women included. Or that’s fully-rounded enough to prioritize his family and home life and doesn’t ‘leave it all to the wife.’ That’s mature enough to only take the credit that’s due to them, rather than stealing glory or ideas from others. Or that’s brave enough to want to learn from people different from themselves. Or that’s worldly enough to listen as well as speak. Or that’s wise enough to know that gendering ‘energy’ is pretty old-fashioned in modern workplaces anyway. It’s not revolutionary to say that all the most successful workplaces are mixed. Mixed genders, backgrounds, skills, experiences, cultures, ambitions and styles. Yes, I’m going to throw you some actual provable data here (not my usual creative tack), but surely a ‘masculine energy’ thing to do is prove out a theory, right?

McKinsey’s Diversity Wins series has consistently found that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity in executive teams tend to outperform peers. Its 2019 analysis showed companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile. Credit Suisse Research Institute studied over 3,000 companies and found that organizations with at least one female board member had higher returns on equity and better stock performance than those with all-male boards. Boston Consulting Group analyzed 1,700 companies and found that those with above-average diversity in management produced innovation revenue that was 19% higher than companies with below-average leadership diversity. So, maybe the most powerful and effective ‘masculine energy’ thing to do should be to hire hugely diverse teams across all levels to ensure your company’s success.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 7:12:16 AM PST by MtnClimber I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Sean Davis, six months after the near-assassination of Donald Trump. The entire hour and a half is well worth your time, but at least watch the first 15 minutes. Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape!

Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

(Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club.

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-78 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-78 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

Business TikTok app with the message "Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now" are seen in this illustration taken, January 19, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration TikTok remained unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the U.S. on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular Chinese-owned short-video app by 75 days. The order came amid growing doubts on the future of the app that went dark on Saturday, shortly before a law that cited national security to say the Chinese owner ByteDance should sell it or face a ban in the U.S. came into effect on Sunday. Although TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, it was yet to return to the app stores. The delay, analysts doubted, could be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app. Apple's App Store said, "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in", while Google Play said, "Downloads for this app are paused due to current US legal requirements". Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. Bill Ford, CEO of TikTok investor General Atlantic, told CNBC on Tuesday there are ways to change TikTok U.S. ownership, that do not necessarily involve its sale. "I don't think that necessarily has to mean a divestiture," he said, referring to the law that bans TikTok, adding that 60 per cent of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, was controlled by non- Chinese shareholders. ByteDance is nearly 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each.

Title: GE Vernova hits new record high as RBC says Trump's order 'not impactful'

Investing.com -- GE Vernova's shares hit a new intraday high of over $407 on Tuesday, bolstered by investor confidence despite recent political developments. RBC Capital analysts reaffirmed their Outperform rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, emphasizing that President Trump's recent executive order on wind leasing and permitting is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company. The executive order temporarily bans offshore wind energy leases within the Outer Continental Shelf and pauses the issuance of new or renewed permits for onshore and offshore wind projects on federal lands, pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. However, RBC noted that only about 5% of the total utility-scale wind energy capacity in the U.S. comes from facilities on public lands. "We do not believe the executive order is of material significance," RBC analysts wrote. "We do not believe the announcement will have a material impact on GEV, given the limited exposure to offshore wind in the U.S. and limited onshore wind development on Federal land." The executive order aligns with President Trump's campaign promises to foster a reliable energy economy, citing legal deficiencies as the rationale for the ban. Despite this, RBC maintains a neutral sentiment on the broader implications for GE Vernova and reiterated its price target of $376 ib the stock.

Title: Rare 'planet parade' event to light up Irish skies tonight - here's how to spot them

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A RARE PLANETARY event which involves the alignment of six planets in a row in our solar system will be visible to the naked eye in Irish skies tonight, astronomers have said. The celestial event, also known as a ‘Planet Parade’ or the ‘great planetary alignment’, will see the sky scattered with a number of visible planets – including Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and Neptune will also be visible through a telescope. Resident astronomer for the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio’s News at One that the planets may be visible for an “entire month” in Irish skies. “We are very lucky – we’ll have the planets in the sky basically throughout the month of February,” Wilcox said. Most people in the Northern Hemisphere will be able to see the planets for the next four weeks. “It’s really nice to have the planets in the sky, we don’t always have so many at one time, Wilcox said. “This evening, will have four of the planets visible without a telescope or binoculars – you’ll have Saturn, Venus, Jupiter and Mars all across the sky.” Advertisement Astronomer Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio that the stars will be visible from late this afternoon. “You don’t need to be out super late to see them, you can go out just after sunset and you’ll be able to see four planets without any sort of equipment,” Wilcox said. Planet-gazers are advised to look to the south, where four of the planets will progressively appear. Venus will be the first planet visible, and will be the “brightest object in the sky” after the sun and moon. “Just as the sun is setting down, one of the planets you’ll be able to spot quickly will be Venus. It will be so incredibly bright, you’ll see that one before the stars even come out,” Wilcox explained. “Following this, Saturn will appear right next to Venus in a south-west direction. Then if you turn towards the south and look slightly south-east, you’ll see Jupiter, and further east, you’ll see Mars. Once they are all visible, the planets will stretch across the southern sky from west to east”. Wilcox added that those with telescopes at home should also be able to spot two other planets, Uranus and Neptune. “They’re a bit farther out as they’re the edge of the solar system, so they will not be visible to the naked eye, but if you have a good telescope, you can look in the same direction to see them,” Wilcox said. “They’ll be in the same line as the rest of the planets, but you do need to have a bit of experience with the telescope to be able to spot those two,” she added. Wilcox went on to explain that the final planet in the solar system, Mercury (sorry Pluto) may also be visible on “particularly clear evenings”. “We’ll hopefully get some good skies towards the end of February, because Mercury will be popping up above the horizon as well, which will give you an additional planet in the sky. It looks like around the 27th will be the best time to see Mercury,” she said. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

January 21, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz ﻿﻿ The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Jonathan Clements on Why Dying is Hard Work, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Boy, what an extra special guest I have. Jonathan Clements was the personal finance columnist at the Wall Street Journal for nearly 25 years. He wrote over a thousand columns. He also worked as director of financial Education at, at Citigroup. Jonathan kind of famously announced that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer on his website as well as social media. And that started this cascade of not just an outpouring of affection and and appreciation for his work, but just a dialogue about how we all should be thinking about our lives, our money, and our life satisfaction. I’ve been a reader of his for, for Forever, and it was really a privilege to have him come into the studios and with no hesitancy, discuss what many people find to be difficult subjects with just tremendous grace and, and insight and dignity. And I, I found it to be an absolutely fascinating conversation. And I think you will also, if you are at all curious about estate planning or investing or personal finance, this is not the usual discussion and I think it’s very worthwhile for you to hear this and share it with friends and family. With no further ado my discussion with Jonathan Clements. Jonathan Clements: Barry, it’s, it’s great to see you again, and it’s great to be on your podcast. Barry Ritholtz: Well, well thank you so much. I’m, I’m glad we have the opportunity to do this before we start talking about the serious heavy stuff. Let, let’s get a little background for you. You, you grow up in, in London, you graduate Cambridge and you start at Euro Money Magazine in, in London. What were you studying at, at Cambridge? What was your original career plan? Jonathan Clements: So, from a relatively early age, I actually thought about being a financial journalist. ’cause my father had been a financial journalist. He spent 10 years in journalism in London. He worked for The Daily Telegraph, he was city editor for the Glasgow Herald. His first job out of college was at the Financial Times, in fact. Wow. And this’ll, this’ll blow your mind. Barry, my father graduated from Cambridge in 1956. He decided he was gonna take the highest paying job he was offered and the highest paying job he was offered. The second highest paying job he was offered at 700 pounds a year was as a management trainee for Shell Oil. The highest paying job he was offered at 800 pounds a year was as a cub reporter for the Financial Times. Wow. Can you imagine a world where the highest paying job you get offered outta college is a job in journalism that, Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. Journalism today has, you know, technology has changed it so much that’s really hard to fathom, although you and I not far apart in age, grew up in an era where media was very specific and thought of as a genuine career. I don’t think even at the journalism schools, people are approaching it the same way. What’s your thoughts on the state of journalism in the modern world? Jonathan Clements: Well, if you said to me, you know, what advice would I give to somebody who wanted to go into journalism, my answer would be, don’t I really feel like I was the last generation that got into journalism and made a career out of it and made a living wage. But anyway, going back to your, your question. Yeah. Financial journalism was always on my radar screen. And even before I went to Cambridge, I actually spent eight months working for a little suburban newspaper outside of Washington DC and in many ways it was the most fun and the most educational experience I had in journalism. I worked for this, you know, rinky dink little paper that came out every other week. The circulation was 25,000. But as a 19-year-old, I was able to not only get involved in writing stories, but also I was involved in the pay stop of the paper for people who remember what pay stop was. I even went on advertising calls with the advertising director. It was so much fun and I learned so much. Barry Ritholtz: So you are from the uk but you’ve spent a lot of time in the us. Where, where did you grow up? Jonathan Clements: Both places. I was born in London and when I was three and a half, my father got a job for the World Bank in Washington DC So we all moved to Washington DC Then just before my 10th birthday, my father was posted to Bangladesh for four years. So my mother and father and my sister went to live full-time in Bangladesh and my two brothers and I got packed off to boarding school in England, which explains everything. You know, we’d go out there during vacations. Four years later, my parents moved back to DC but with my parents’ encouragement, I stayed on a boarding school in England, went to Cambridge, worked there for a year, and then after a year as a journalist in London, I realized the standard living for reporters in England seriously sucked. And that’s when I decided to move to New York City and I joined Forbes Magazine as a glorified fact checker and immediately doubled my salary moving from London. Barry Ritholtz: Well didn’t you also double your cost? New York back then was still in the nineties. New York was really an expensive place to live. Jonathan Clements: London is also a really expensive place to live. And in any case, at the time I was actually living out in Princeton with my graduate student wife. Barry Ritholtz: You go from Forbes pretty much during the golden era of, of mutual funds and star managers like the eighties and nineties, that was Peak mutual fund. What was that like looking at it as the data was becoming clearer that, hey, this may not be the best deal for investors? Jonathan Clements: Yeah, when I was at Forbes after this initial spell as a fact checker, I was given the mutual funds beat and the core article as the mutual funds reporter for Forbes Magazine. And subsequently, when I covered mutual funds for the journal, was the star manager profile. And it was very formulaic. You, you went and you interviewed some star manager, usually a man, and you would have a couple paragraphs about their investment philosophy and strategy. You would offer three of their stock picks where they were probably touting stocks they wanted to unload from their portfolio. And the managers you selected were all based on past performance. And one of the things I started to realize in those years was these star managers, well, their stars started to flame out pretty quickly. And this of course was the experience of many investors across, you know, the us And that was in many ways, you know, the, the seeds of the, the index fund revolution. The people bought these star managers, you know, one after another, the managers started to flame out, they bought new star managers, they ended up with these portfolios that were just a hodgepodge of ex star fund managers. And that really set us up for the boom in indexing in the late 1990s and into the two thousands. Barry Ritholtz: The the funny thing is, the behavioral aspect of mutual funds seems to have been when people finally learn about a manager who’s put up great numbers, by the time it makes to make makes it to Forbes, hey, most of that run is probably over and a little mean reversion is about to kick in. That experience led you to becoming the index guy. Tell us a little bit what it was like being an index guy at a time when it wasn’t as popular or well thought of as it is today. Jonathan Clements: So in 1994, at the lofty age of 31, the journal gave me my own column, which in retrospect is absurd. A 31-year-old their own, Barry Ritholtz: It seemed to have worked out well for them though, to be fair. Yeah, right. Jonathan Clements: But I’m not sure I would give a 31-year-old that that chance, but okay. But yes, I was given my own column and by that point, having seen all these star managers come and go, you know, I had become an index fund devotee, and in column after column I banged the drum for index funds to the point where my editors were asking me, Hey, could you write about something else? But the numbers you can’t argue with, I mean, we all know that the brutal math of investing before costs investors collectively will earn the market return after costs. They will earn that market return less, whatever they’re paying. If you can just match the market’s return minus some tiny amount for an index funds expenses, you are gonna outperform the vast majority investors. And that annual advantage snowballs over time until probably the early two thousands, that message didn’t resonate as widely, in part because index funds were the preserve of Van, got a couple of other, you know, fund companies, but then these ETFs came along, these exchange traded index funds, and at that point, any financial advisor, any broker could sell index funds to their clients. And it was really the ETF revolution that took indexing and turned it into a national phenomenon that now it surpasses the amount of money inactively managed funds. 00:09:30 [Speaker Changed] So that’s an interesting thesis. I I know ETFs are really significant to the adoption of, of indexing, but SP Y’s been around for, seems like forever. It certainly was around in the nineties. What was it about the two thousands specifically? Was it just the variety of choice? Why do you think ETFs kicked off so much a, a attraction to, to indexing, especially considering the bulk of those monies that flowed to BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street? 00:10:05 [Speaker Changed] Well, so you’re right, you know, Spyders, SPY was came out I believe in 1993, but it was just the s and p 500 and it was just that single fund, the exchange traded index funds really did take off thanks to what was then Barclay’s now part of BlackRock with the iShare series. And suddenly you could buy index funds that cover all of the major asset classes. And you, because they were stocks that traded on the, the market, you didn’t have to have an agreement with Vanguard or with Fidelity in order to sell those funds. You just needed a brokerage account. And suddenly every broker, every financial advisor where they were operating through Merrill Lynch or Schwab could sell those funds and indexing was available to, all prior to that, there were a lot of brokers who would never have sold an index fund because they didn’t have access to Vanguard’s platform. 00:10:57 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back a little bit on that. My experience has been that the brokerage side, at least up until recently, was much more interested in the value add. And I’m, I’m making air quotes for listeners of stock selection, fund selection, manager selection, and they seem to have been less keen on passive or indexing. Whereas the RIA side of the street, the independent advisor that, or the certified planner, they seem to be more focused on, let’s get a plan, let’s figure out what your objectives are and the market will take care of itself. How, how do you see that that shift? I, I’ve watched that over decades. You, you were in the thick of it. I’m curious as to what you witnessed. 00:11:44 [Speaker Changed] So you’re right. I mean, these sort of traditional brokers were much slower to adopt ETFs than, you know, fee only financial advisors. But today, you know, a lot of brokers, you know, whether they’re with the big full service brokerage firms now have advisory accounts that they flog to clients where they can buy ETFs. And as long as they’re getting their fee, whatever it’s, you know, one, one and a half percent, whatever know amount it is, you know, they now have an incentive to sell those ETFs. And remember, if you’re an advisor and you’re selling ETFs, I mean, there’s no reason to ever say sorry. Right. That’s 00:12:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:12:21 [Speaker Changed] You get the markets return. Surprise, surprise. 00:12:24 [Speaker Changed] Well, if you tilt it all towards international or emerging markets or value, there are occasional apologies along the way. Hey, but that’s the, what’s the old joke? The cost of diversification is frequently having to apologize for something that’s not keeping up with s and p. 00:12:41 [Speaker Changed] If nothing in your portfolio is performing badly, you’re not diversified. That’s 00:12:44 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s exactly right. So, so you said something interesting that jogged something in my mind that you were constantly flogging passive indexing and ETFs, much to the chagrin of your editors. Kind of makes me think of something Jason Zweig has said, which is his job is to write the same column over and over again, but in a way that neither his editors nor the readers, no. What are, what are your thoughts on repeating yourself over and over again, but in new and interesting ways? 00:13:15 [Speaker Changed] So Jason was the next employee hired by Forbes after me. Oh, 00:13:20 [Speaker Changed] That’s hilarious. 00:13:21 [Speaker Changed] And when I left Forbes, Jason ended up with the mutual funds beat, then he went on to Money Magazine. And then when I left the journal for the first time in 2008, they said, well, who should we hire to replace you? I said, Jason’s wife. So Jason and I have known each other for over 30 years. I, he, I consider him to be one of my best friends. And in fact, you know, through my recent diagnosis, he’s been a, a super supportive, you know, we’ve remain great friends after all these years, and I’m a huge admirer of his work for the Journal and elsewhere. So yes, Jason has the same joke that I do, which is, you know, there are only 20 personal finance stories, which means that by the time I left the journal and writing a thousand columns, I’ve written each of those stories 50 times each. 00:14:06 You know, if you are going to serve your readers well, you know, there are only a limited number of stories to be written. You know, if you’re a reporter who spends their career writing the stock of the day, the fun of the month, just flogging one thing after another, trying to predict the market’s direction, you’ll be plenty busy, but your readership will be a whole lot poorer. So if you wanna do the right thing, you’re basically gonna have to have a set of sound principles and focus on them again and again. And one of the things you discover is that you sta start to sound like a repetitive blathering idiot. And that’s when for me, and I think also for Jason, you start casting around for other things to write about. So when I go back to the late 1980s and I started as a financial journalist, the sole topic was investing. 00:14:51 It was all about which fund to buy, which stock to buy. Fortunately, over time, the field that is personal finance has expanded. So today, if you are a good financial journalist, you should be writing not just about investing, but about topics like, you know, when to claim social security, what should you have in your estate plan, you know, what sort of house should you be buying? And then beyond that, writing about things like behavioral finance, thinking about things like money and happiness, the topic that we call financial journalism is expended enormously over the past three plus decades. And that’s good news for somebody like me, because if I’d still writing only about index funds, I would’ve been out of a job a long time ago. 00:15:33 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. So, so the 20 years you spent at the Journal really is a fascinating couple of decades. You, you wrote at the journal through the.com implosion as well as the whole runup to 2000 September 11th, the great financial Crisis. What era of finance did you find the most intriguing as a journalist? 00:15:58 [Speaker Changed] I know this probably sounds like an a I’m an ambulance chaser, but you know what, the periods that I enjoyed the most was when the stock market was going down. 00:16:07 [Speaker Changed] I’m, I totally agree with you. I am, I, I have been warned repeatedly, Hey, people are getting, you know, really hurt out there. Can you, can you stop whistling into the office like that? But that’s when the most amount of fascinating things happen and the most amount of opportunities present themselves. Which leads me to my next question, right into the teeth of the financial crisis. You went 95% into stocks. Tell us a little bit about why you did that, which turned out to be the right call, and how you shared that information with your readers. 00:16:42 [Speaker Changed] Coming into sort of late 2008, I think, if I recall correctly, I was somewhere between 70 and 80% stocks by that point. I’d left the journal and I was working at Citi Groupers, director of financial education for the wealth management business. And a, a number of things happened. One was I was working at Wall Street, so I was earning a whole lot more money. Two, I got my first Wall Street bonus three, I sold another book, which meant I got a big advance. And four, tragically my father was killed during this period, and I inherited money from him. And I took every one of those dollars and put them into the stock market. And it was a time when the sequence of returns, that combination of what’s going on in the market and whether you’re pulling out money from your portfolio, putting it in work like magic, and said to people numerous times when we have a period like 2008, 2009, when everybody thinks the world is going to hell in a hand basket, well, if it really does go to hell, doesn’t matter what you own. Right? 00:17:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s 00:17:42 [Speaker Changed] Right. Right. More than likely, you know, we, humans being humans will figure out a way to solve this problem and the market will come roaring back. And what you wanna own at that point is stocks. So I just backed up the cart and bought stocks like crazy. 00:17:57 [Speaker Changed] So that’s kind of interesting that you’re making an active decision in the face of market turmoil and increased volatility. Did at any point in that process, did you feel like, Hey, you know, I’m kind of going against everything I’ve said in the past, or was it people said stocks were pricing now they’re cheap, I’m just a value investor. 00:18:22 [Speaker Changed] Well, guilty is charged Mary. I mean, I can’t entirely justify it, but over my career as an investing, the things that I’ve learned is one that, you know, you can’t win through stock selection. You can’t win by buying actively managed funds. You know, what you need to do is indexing, but one way you can tilt the field in your favor is in periods when people are panicking, is to, as I like to put it, ovary bound to move even more into stocks. It’s, it’s a temporary move. But you know, I’ve done it repeatedly. I did it in 2000, 2002. I did it in 2008 in oh nine. I did it during the coronavirus collapse in 2020, and I did it again in 2022. You don’t know what the bottom of the market looks like. I think it’s very hard to say stocks are objectively cheap because all of these valuation metrics have, have become unreliable over the decades as the nature of the stock market has changed. But the one thing I have learned is that if the market is off 20, 30%, things are a whole lot cheaper than they were prior to the decline. And what you should do is buy, 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s easier said than done. You mentioned covering behavioral finance as a way to look beyond just indexing funds. Tell us a little bit about the challenges that the average investor faces trying to buy into a, a down 30% market when everybody else is panicking and running the other way. 00:19:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, we know how investors behave, which is, they extrapolate recent returns. So if the market’s going up, they think it’s gonna keep going up, it’s going down, they assume it’s gonna keep going down. And that of course is what everybody around them is doing. They’re also extrapolating returns. It’s very hard to step aside from the narrative of that time and think independently. But that’s what you need to do to be a successful investor. At a bare minimum, at a bare minimum, if you can just stand your ground, you’ll probably do a whole lot better than most investors who will tend to be buying and selling at just the wrong time. I 00:20:29 [Speaker Changed] Just have to ask you a little bit about what you did after the journal, and that includes both Citigroup and Humble Dollar. You, you were at Citigroup for about six years and you were director of education. Tell us a little bit about what that role encompassed and what it was like dealing with city investors rather than journal readers. And I’m sure there’s a bit of an overlap there. 00:20:53 [Speaker Changed] So as in the couple years running up to early 2008, I was getting increasingly burned out on writing the column. And I, and I was thinking like, I gotta do something else in life. And I cast around, I I talked to various people about different jobs. Nothing quite rang a bell for me. And then I was approached by Citigroup about being director of financial education for this startup called MiFi. And the idea was they were gonna help small investors with their entire financial life in return for a fixed monthly fee. That was the notion, lovely notion, but two things went wrong. One is the idea of doing a startup within a large corporation is absolutely absurd. Companies are, large, companies are incapable of innovating in that way. It was just a struggle from day one, particularly in the regulatory environment that is the securities business between lawyers and compliance people. 00:21:46 Everything was a headache. And then on top of that, of course we ran straight into the 2008, 2009 great recession. So the business was pretty much dead before it began. And by the summer of 2009, they’d pulled the plug on this venture and suddenly, you know, I’ve thrown away my journalism career to join Citigroup. You know, what would happen next? Well, this group of people that were part of this startup for MiFi were rolled into the traditional bank based brokerage business, if you can imagine, two completely different group of people. And then on top of that, they decided they were gonna try to turn these bank based brokers into fee financial advisors, 00:22:24 [Speaker Changed] Which by the way, was the underlying trend outside of the brokerage firm. They were watching what was a small part of the business really begin to blossom post-crisis. 00:22:36 [Speaker Changed] So I became part of this new business and I did a lot of writing and a lot of public speaking over the next, you know, four plus years until I realized that, you know, I really wasn’t doing much good in the world. Huh? I I was collecting a nice paycheck, the biggest paycheck in my life, but I really felt like I was wasting my time. And I’ve never really done anything in my career solely for money. And I suddenly dawn on me that really, I was just living for my paycheck. So I made a plan to get out of there. I realized I had enough to retire if I wanted to. I was in my, I was 51, so I spent 10 or 11 months preparing to leave. I contacted the journal about writing for them again, I also started working on a book. And after I got my last urine bonus in early 2014, I walked in and handed, handed my notice. Huh. 00:23:33 [Speaker Changed] So you said something i, I have to follow up on. I can’t tell you how many people have said, you know, I don’t really do this for the money. And very often they get pushback, but I feel that way and I know you feel that way. What sort of response do you get from people when you say, well, I’m getting a nice paycheck, but that’s not why I do this? 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] I think that in this case, I probably did not express it to people that way. I’m not saying that I don’t like getting paid, but, 00:24:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, we all like getting paid. But the question is, why do we do what we do? Is it for the money or is the money like a nice aspect of being able to do what you really love? 00:24:13 [Speaker Changed] And it’s really the latter. And I think it partly depends on the economic comfort in which you grew up. I mean, I grew up in a very comfortable middle class or from middle class household, so money was never my priority going into the workforce. You know, I wanted to cover the costs, obviously I wanted to save for the future, but I was never motivated by money. If I was motivated by money, I would never have ended up in journalism. That’s 00:24:36 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. And and you have said, especially post-diagnosis, you’ve very publicly said, gee, had I known when, when the clock was gonna run out, I would’ve spent money more aggressively. It’s kind of interesting that you were saving, despite having come from a a fairly comfortable background. Clarify that a little bit. How, how did you think about spending money and how did the diagnosis change your, your perspectives on this? 00:25:06 [Speaker Changed] So there are two reasons why I became very focused on saving money. First, what I call the great family story. So when my great, great grandfather died in 1888, he was listed in the newspapers as one of the richest men in England. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Really? I have no idea. That’s fascinating. 00:25:23 [Speaker Changed] He, he was based out of Liverpool and he and his brother had launched a cigarette company called COPE Cigarettes. And they made a ton of money that Fortune ended up with my great-grandmother, and she lived the Downton Abbey lifestyle. She had an estate in the Cotswolds on which there were five mansions. Wow. She lived in one and her various children lived in the other houses on the estate. The estate was inherited by the kids to a person. They blew the money in short order, 00:25:57 [Speaker Changed] Classic three generations, shirt, sleeves to shirt sleeves. 00:26:00 [Speaker Changed] Right. So I grew up with that great family story about how you shouldn’t, you know, waste money, how you should think about the future. Huh. And then added to that was when I got out of college and I got into the workforce, I ended up getting married and having kids really quickly. I was a father at age 25 supporting a graduate student wife and living in New York City. And tight 00:26:22 [Speaker Changed] Money’s a little tight. 00:26:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, ordering a pizza on a Friday night was a questionable decision. And, you know, I learned to be super careful with money. And that continued for probably 30 years. It’s really in the last five years that I’ve become happier about spending money, eating out more often, traveling more. And of course, since my diagnosis, you know, I’ve been doing even more of that. I mean, it’s, I still wanna make sure that my kids and my wife inherit plenty of money. But I’m at the point where, okay, I’m, I don’t need to stay for the future anymore. ’cause there isn’t much future left for me. So we’ve been traveling more. But to come back to the question that you’re gonna ask me, which is do I regret my earlier frugality? Not really. Because what I would say to you, Barry, is one sure way that money buys happiness is by allowing you not to worry about money. Absolutely. And I have not worried about money for years. 00:27:19 [Speaker Changed] And, and to be fair, you know, I don’t want to engage in what Annie Duke calls resulting when you, you know, all of us are born not knowing how long we have. And when you get an end date, when you know when the game is gonna end, well now you have that information. It’s not fair to go back and say, Hey, 20 years ago had you known, what would you have done differently? Because at the time you don’t know, it’s impossible to go back and, and revisit those decisions. The question really the fairer question is the advice you would offer people who don’t know what the end date is. How much should they be saving, how much should they be occasionally taking money out and enjoying it? And obviously it’s all a function of specifics, but how has your perspective changed, if at all, when you’re giving that sort of advice to people? 00:28:12 [Speaker Changed] So first of all, I would say to you, Barry, one of the things that’s the greatest source of happiness to me is just the day to day. You know, just getting up in the morning, having a cup of coffee, sitting at my laptop, writing and editing, you know, going out for, for lunch, having a glass of wine in the evening with lame, these are not expensive things for me. A happy life does not cost a whole lot of money. Yes. You know, we are doing more traveling now and, you know, we are traveling first class or business class, which I wouldn’t have done a couple of years ago. So yeah, I’m spending more freely, but the real happiness I get is basically doing what I’ve always done, which is to do work that I think is important. That is a big source of happiness for me. And not only does it not cost very much, but it actually earns me some money. So the other thing I would say to people is, you do not want to do all of this too early on. You know, if I had flown business class regularly in my twenties, it would not be special to me. Today, having a gradually rising standard of living throughout your life is a wonderful thing. You know, if you stayed at Motel six in your twenties, staying at a Hyatt in your sixties seems pretty special. 00:29:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. That’s really interesting. So, so let’s talk a little bit about Humble Dollar. When did you set that up and you’re still, you’re still running that and publishing yourself with a, a group of other people? Tell us a little bit about the Humble Dollar. 00:29:38 [Speaker Changed] So, humble Dollar was launched right at the end of 2016. I used it essentially to take a annually updated financial guide that I was producing. And I decided just to throw it on the web and make it freely available and run some ads against it. And as part of that, I invited a few people to start writing for the site. And that snowballed over time. And today I have, you know, probably 50 or 60 people who write occasionally for the site. Really? They all do it for free. They’re all amateur writers. And the thing I say to these amateur writers is, you know, you know, you may not be financial experts, but you are experts on your own life. So I encourage them to write about their own financial lives. And the result has been that people engage in a level of financial disclosure about what they’ve done with their own money that the readership finds fascinating, they find liberating. And it’s become, to my surprise, I mean this is not what I set out to do. It’s become a place where people happily talk about their own finances. And the readership tends to be very supportive. I do carefully moderate comments. I mean, if I feel like people are getting too rough on somebody, I’ll, I’ll delete comments. I also steer people away from the endless political commentary that’s poisoned social media. And it’s becomes, I like to think a safe place for people to talk about their own finances. 00:31:05 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I think that’s the right approach. I mean, I, I had a comment section on the blog on the big picture for, I dunno, close to 10 years, and mil literally millions of comments. And at a certain point really post-financial crisis, it kind of began going off the rails. And I I did the same thing you did. It’s like, hey, this is not a political forum. And if you’re gonna just really be, you know, it takes so much time and effort for someone to write something and it’s so easy to just dismiss it, it doesn’t seem fair. And I think your approach is the right, right way to go is is, I don’t know what sort of pushback you get to it from the readers. But the other thing I wanted to ask you about that, not just the other writers on the humble dollar, but the comments is people are kind of weird about money. Some, sometimes people are just like, it’s perplexing how some people think about money or use money. Tell us a little bit about your experiences dealing with the public and trying to be sort of calm and rational when consumerism and materialism very often isn’t. 00:32:11 [Speaker Changed] So, I’m not sure I have a clear view on how the typical American thinks about money these days. You know, what I have is a, a relatively narrow audience, somewhat older, more affluent. They tend to have been drawn to the site because they followed me for a number of years. A lot of them are indexers, most of them are great savers. And the biggest issue for them is not saving more and delaying gratification even more. But learning how to spend in retirement. I mean, that is the biggest struggle. Obviously not a struggle for most Americans. People do have peculiarities about money. You know this as well as I do. It varies enormously. So it’s hard to generalize, right? Probably most people are naturally inclined to spend too much and to save too little. But in terms of my audience, they’re inclination is to spend too little and save too much. So 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about that. ’cause we have about 30 advisors who are CFPs that work in my shop. And one of the common conversations is, I have a client, he’s got millions of dollars invested. We can’t get him to spend money. He wants to buy a vacation property, can’t pull the trigger, they wanna take the family on a European trip and he thinks it’s gonna cost too much. How do you help people who were earners and savers pivot in their fifties, sixties, seventies to becoming spenders? 00:33:33 [Speaker Changed] I think that pushing people to spend more is unlikely to work. I think instead you should talk about other goals. I mean, do you want to start giving money to your kids? Do you wanna start giving money to charity? Think of other ways to get them to let go of some of their dollars and maybe that doorway will become the doorway to start spending more on themselves. Certainly I’ve changed over the last five years, five years ago, sort of pre pandemic, I was very careful about spending. I didn’t go out to eat a lot, didn’t spend a lot on travel. And I think one of the things that for me coming outta the pandemic was a willingness to spend more to go out and enjoy life more after that long period stuck at home. And of course my diagnosis has, has, has done that even more. And not only have I been spending more, I’ve also been giving more to, to my kids, to charity and so on. So I think if you could open the door a little bit and people get comfortable with it, then they’ll spend more. And giving away money, whether to charity or to your children, is a way of opening that door. 00:34:36 [Speaker Changed] So I don’t know if this is my perspective or if this is accurate or not. I kind of recall prior generations the wealth was passed down out of the estate after the person passed away, they would leave their money to their family. It seems like it’s a little more modern concept is why not give them the money when you can watch them enjoy it, buy a house, travel, whatever. Is that a skewed perspective or, or do you see something similar? 00:35:07 [Speaker Changed] No, absolutely. People definitely seem to be happier to give away money now. And it’s not simply that you get the pleasure of seeing your kids enjoy the money. You can also guide how they use it. I actually just wrote checks at the beginning of the year to both my kids and you know, my kids ask, well, what should I do with the money? So it’s a chance to say, yeah, you know, you wanna put it into your retirement account, you wanna put it into your emergency fund, you wanna use it to pay down the mortgage. The other thing of course is that you get get to see them enjoy it. Right. And they are at the point where, you know, if I give my kids $19,000 this year under the gift tax exclusion, which is the sum you can give without how filing a gift tax return, that money to them in their thirties is so much more valuable than it is to me in my sixties. Right, right. I mean, they’re at a point where they’re still under a fair amount of financial stress. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. I mean, financial stress’s motivating. Yeah, exactly. That’s how you learn good spending habits, but you also get a lot of pleasure from getting a $19,000 check from your father. 00:36:14 [Speaker Changed] So a theme that we seem to be talking about is things that have changed. People are giving money away sooner rather than as part of the estate. We’ve talked about the shift from active mutual funds to passive ETFs. What other significant shifts have you observed over the course of your career? 00:36:33 [Speaker Changed] So we did touch on this as well, which is what is considered financial journalism has changed. It used to be that everybody was solely focused on investing and solely focused on beating the market. I mean, that was the discussion, you know, day in, day out. And to some extent it, it still is on in the financial media, but you know, the, the playing field is widened. So we are talking about things in what I consider personal finance, home ownership, social security, tax management, estate planning and so on. We’re also talking about how money meets life, things like behavioral finance, things like money and happiness. And I think the next big focus within personal finance is trying to bring this down to the individual level. Not just making, you know, broad generalizations about, you know, investors have this behavioral bias or that behavioral bias. Not talking in generalities about how you can use money to, to, to boost happiness. But you as an individual, you know, what sort of individual are you? Are you a savior? Are you a spender? You know, what is it from your past that is triggering you? I think that in the years ahead we will start focusing more on that and that will lead to even more interesting conversations about money as people get to know themselves better. And that works into how they manage their money. 00:37:58 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about your announcement. Last year you received a stage four lung cancer diagnosis. You are a non-smoker, so this is the genetic variation of the disease. Tell us a little bit about that diagnosis and what motivated you to share it so publicly. 00:38:21 [Speaker Changed] So back in May of last year, Barry, I started having balance issues and I, I thought I might have an ear infection. I couldn’t figure out quite what was going on. So I, on a Sunday, decided to go to an urgent care clinic and the doctor saw me at the urgent care clinic, must have realized something that was going on that, you know, was obviously I was missing. So I got dispatched to the emergency room and the next thing you know, I was stuck in the stroke victim really ward at, at a hospital in Philadelphia. So it was 16 beds up there, 15 guys who were intubated plus me sitting on the edge of my bed, like, geez, what am I doing here? Wow. So after some, some scans, some MRIs, they realized that I, I had not had a minor stroke. Instead I had, I had cancer, they found 10 lesions on my brain. 00:39:16 Wow. And a golf ball size growth on my lungs. And after some, some genetic testing and so on, they discovered that I had a relatively rare form of cancer that tends to flick people of Asian origin origin in women called EGFR Exon 20. And it’s a relatively aggressive cancer. The median life expectancy for people who have EGFR exon 20 is 16 months. Wow. So by the time I got to see the oncologist, she suggested I might have a year to live. And that was in June of 2024. Since then, I’ve had a couple more lesions on my brain and the cancers also spread to my spine. In both cases, the, the cancer on my spine was dealt with, with radiation similarly to the new lesions on my brain. I’ve also had recently had a two hour procedure to shore up my spine because of the damage done by the cancer. 00:40:17 Otherwise, there’s a risk I was gonna fracture my spine. So as of today, I’m, I’m feeling okay. But, you know, the cancer is, you know, is it my blood? It’s likely to crop up somewhere else. I think I’m gonna beat the one year mark that I was given. I’m hoping I’ll make it through 2025. But, you know, realistically, it’s unlikely that I’m gonna make it much beyond then, though of course I would love it. I mean, I have to say this Barry, you I love every day and I want every moment I can get. But you know, you have to be realistic and, you know, this is stage four cancer. There is no recovery. You know, it’s just a matter of trying to control the cancer. And, you know, I have the good fortune, I came into this in reasonably good physical shape. So I’ve coped with the, the treatment fairly well. 00:41:10 You know, I’m, I’m having chemo and immunotherapy every three weeks, taking countless medications. You know, I’ve had these radiation treatments. As I said, I just had my back operated on in order to shore it up. But, you know, at some point, you know, cancer is gonna win. I just dunno when. So come back to answer the question that you asked. So yeah, after I got the diagnosis, I, I wrote about it on my website and, you know, put out the word on social media and the response to me was quite surprising. I mean, not only did I get, you know, an outpouring of love heard from people, I hadn’t heard from in years, readers have shown a lot of love. But people also said, you know, you’re so brave for sharing your diagnosis. I was like, brave. I’ve spent my entire life writing about my own finances. 00:42:00 Why would I, why would I stop now? And you know, is it that people don’t talk about the stuff because of denial? Is it because, you know, they’re just, they’re embarrassed? Is it because of fear of death? I don’t know. But it seems like the most natural thing in the world to write about it. And to my surprise, I seem to have done a fair amount of good by doing so. People really appreciate somebody talking openly about what it is, what it’s like to have a, a terminal diagnosis. I would also say to you that a short life expectancy, this notion that your life is finite. I mean, of course that’s true for all of us, right? But it really does make you focus on the day to day. I mean, when I, you know, get up in the morning, I really notice the taste of the coffee. When I take a walk. I really notice how beautiful the trees are, how lovely the sky is. It really does focus the mind. And if anything, because I know the time is finite, I’m joined the day to day even more. It’s, it’s strange, but it’s true. And I would say to people, you know, even if you don’t have a terminal diagnosis, you know, try to be sort of more purposeful and more mindful about each day because you’ll get greater happiness out of each day. 00:43:18 [Speaker Changed] Well that, that’s really good advice. You wrote a Wall Street Journal piece, some final personal finance advice. And some of the things you discussed were, were really, I, I don’t wanna say funny, but just the way you phrased them were so blunt and matter of fact it was really intriguing. Let me run a few through a few of these and I’d like to get your your thoughts on it. The, the first one that leapt off the page was death is hard work. 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Explain. So I’ve always had my finances pretty well organized, but until you know that you’re about to pop off, you realize how much, sorry to use the phrase, how much crap you’ve accumulated. And you realize how hard it will be for your family to figure out your finances. So in the, the weeks and months that followed, I’ve done all kinds of things. I got a, a new will, powers of attorney, I closed accounts so that there, there are fewer accounts for my family. Everything’s 00:44:22 [Speaker Changed] Consolidated in one place. They 00:44:23 [Speaker Changed] Were already consolidated. But for instance, I had a, a Roth 401k and it’s like, I’m, I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna fund this anymore. So I’m gonna close it and roll it into my regular IRAI had an inherited IRA from my father. It didn’t have very much in it. So I, I closed that out. But also down in the basement, I had a box of papers, a couple boxes of papers. Some of them went back to when I was in college. It was like what I had every Christmas card from 1986. Wow. Why do I need every Christmas card from 1986? So I just started trashing all of this stuff and you carry around this stuff for decades, right? Thinking one day you’re gonna look at it. Well, this was my moment to look at it. And you know what, I didn’t, I just started sticking in the recycling bin. So there was a lot of work to be done in order to simplify things for my, for my wife and for my kids. And I still have more work to do. So I, all the utilities are currently in my name and in the weeks ahead, one of the final things I want to do is to make sure that I move, you know, the internet, the cell phones, the gas, the water, the electricity, all into Elaine’s name so that this one less thing for her to do after I’m gone. 00:45:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really very thoughtful. The other thing that really leapt off the page was so much talking. 00:45:41 [Speaker Changed] So two days after my diagnosis, both my kids were in town, landlords in town, I sat ’em down and I explained my estate plan. And of course all this was obvious to me, you know, well there’s this traditional ira, there are these Roth IRAs, regular taxable accounts, there’s, you know, this account, that account, and they’re looking at me like, like during the headlights, like what is all this about? And it’s when I realized that the stuff that’s second nature to me isn’t second nature to my kids. So had an hour discussion then and so many discussions since then as I’ve tried to explain like, you know, why you should not spend the Roth IRA until the end of the 10 year period, but you’ll have to draw down the traditional IRA over time ’cause it’s gonna be taxable income on top of your income. Lots of stuff like that. That second nature to me just wasn’t clear to them. 00:46:32 [Speaker Changed] And, and the last thing was simply taxing matters how I, I’m assuming your estate is not gonna be in the taxable size. So what do you discuss with your wife and kids about taxes? 00:46:47 [Speaker Changed] So my kids will be subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax four point half percent. And so, you know, that’s why I’ve started to distribute money to them. Now I had written a private mortgage for my daughter, it’s current, it was currently a little over $300,000. And I forgave that loan and then adjusted how much she’s get gonna get versus how much my son is gonna get. And as long as I make it through to July past the one year mark, then Hannah won’t have to pay the inheritance tax on, on that money soon it 00:47:22 [Speaker Changed] Becomes part of the estate and it’s non-taxable at that point? 00:47:25 [Speaker Changed] Well it’s, it’s not part of the estate at all. So she won’t have, you know, she won’t have to pay the inheritance tax on that $300,000. Oh, okay. So there are a variety of things like that that I, you know, I’ve done in order to make things a little less taxing for my kids. It’s also why as soon as January one passed this year, that’s why I made them a gift for 2025. Similarly for my grandchildren, you know, I funded their 5 29 plans early in the year so that I can get that money, you know, out of my estate and hopefully I’ll make it past the one year mark. So it’s not subject to the inheritance tax. 00:47:59 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really intriguing. So given your, your diagnosis, has your perspectives on money and happiness at all changed? How have you thought about some of your previous philosophies and, and views? 00:48:15 [Speaker Changed] I think one of the things that makes me happy through this period is not only that I don’t have to worry about money with everything else that’s going on, money isn’t not a worry. So when I go back to the twenties and thirties and the sacrifices I made, I’m glad I made them so that I have that financial security today. So that amid everything else that’s going on, money is not something that’s top of mind for me. Truth is, I haven’t really worried about money for, for years. But, you know, it’d be terrible to be faced with huge medical costs potentially and not have the finances to cover it. I’ve also, however, you know, thought about, you know, this is my retirement, right? If I don’t enjoy my retirement now, such as it is, I’m never gonna enjoy it. So yeah, I have been spending more freely, you know, we went to London recently, we went to Ireland, I took the family on a fairly luxurious long weekend. This month we’re going to Paris. We’re, we’ve got other trips planned in the months ahead. There’s a limit how far I can plan ahead because I never know when I’m gonna get derailed by some bad diagnosis. And I hate the idea of the cancellation fees, but you know, we do have trips planned and we’ve booked the hotels, but I haven’t booked the flights because I don’t wanna have to cancel ’em. Huh. 00:49:34 [Speaker Changed] So, so we talked earlier about money and happiness. I’m curious as to how you think about the relationship between life satisfaction, wellbeing and what money does and does not help you obtain. 00:49:51 [Speaker Changed] So money I believe can do three things for you. One, it can allow you not to worry about money. We’ve talked about this already in many ways. You know, money doesn’t buy happiness. It lets you avoid unhappiness, the unhappiness of being broke. But two money can buy you the financial freedom. Spend your days doing what you love. If you love your job, that’s great. That’s the greatest combination get. But a lot of people clearly don’t love their jobs. So what they want is the financial freedom to do whatever it is they wished to be able to do. And you get that by saving diligently year after year, decade after decade. And then third, money can allow you to have special times with friends and family and you know, whether it’s, you know, the barbecue, the special vacation flying across the country to see the grandchildren, whatever it is, money can allow you to do that. So those three things, avoiding the unhappiness of being broke, two, doing whatever you think is fulfilling. And three is spending special times with friends and family. That’s what money can do for you. That is the way that money can buy happiness. 00:50:55 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Very intriguing. So you’ve mentioned a lot of your earlier in life financial decisions have set you up in a good financial situation today. What, what decisions do you look back and say, oh, I, I’m really glad I did that. What were the, with hindsight, with the benefit of hindsight, what were the choices you made that you most appreciate today? 00:51:23 [Speaker Changed] Prob probably like everybody, you know, Barry, who has, you know, amassed some wealth on their own. The smartest thing I ever did was to be a good saver. You know, if, you know, if you’re a good saver, you know, everything else is, everything’s gonna turn out fine. Even if you’re not a great investor, as long as you’re a good saver, you know, good things will happen if you’re a lousy saver, but a great investor, you know, it’s unlikely that you’re gonna succeed financially. So yeah, saving was the number one thing. And then two, I was very early as you might imagine on the indexing train. And that has also rebounded to my benefit, but it’s, it’s been a saver that was not top of the list. 00:52:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let me flip that question around. What do you think most people get wrong? What are some of the biggest myths in investing in finance that we often have a hard time getting past? 00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, certainly, you know, this focus on investing, this focusing on beating the market is the wrong place to, you know, be spending your time. But let me, let me broaden it out, Barry. So something that I’ve been thinking about a lot of late, which is most people, and and this is, was true of me in the early days, spend too much time worrying in general and worrying about money specifically. And I think this is hardwired into us. You know, we are here because our hunter gatherer ancestors survived. And why did they survive? Because they were warriors, right? They worried about everything, you know, they wanted to make sure that they were gonna be okay no matter what happened. Well, guess what? You know, the saber tooth tiger is not gonna leap out of the bushes. You know, we do not need to worry the way we, our ancestors used to. 00:53:02 And yet people worry constantly. I mean, people are serial worriers. It’s like the hedonic treadmill. We talk about how, you know, we strive towards goals, hoping that they’re gonna make us happy forever. And then boom, we achieve whatever it is and we immediately start striving off to something else. We can’t get off that treadmill. Well, there’s also a worry treadmill, and we worry about something bababababa choose away from us. The worry goes away, we’re onto something else. People cannot escape their worries. And what I would want for, for listeners, and I want I want for my readers is please find some way to worry less. Because if you do the right stuff financially, you live beneath your means. You’re not crazy with your investment. Hopefully you index, you know, hopefully you don’t take on too much debt. You know, you, you’re not gonna get it all right. 00:53:56 But good things will happen in the end. You don’t have to spend 30, 40 years worrying about retirement. You don’t have to get to retirement and worry that you’re spending a crazy amount of money because you’re gonna get derailed by the stock market or whatever it is. Things are likely to walk out just fine. We are not, you know, back, you know, in, you know, like our hunter gatherer ancestors, you know, worried about every threat. You know, it’s, it’s time to let go of those worries. I, that to me is the biggest mistake people make. And I don’t have a magic cure for getting away from those worries. But I do believe that is the number one thing we could do for our own happiness. Huh. 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Really, really very interesting. Of all the things you’ve learned over the course of being a personal finance columnist, first for Forbes and for the Journal and, and everything you’ve done in at The Humble Dollar, aside from Worry Less, what do you think is the the most important piece of financial wisdom that you wanna pass along that you wanna have outlive you? What, what’s the most significant thing you wish people would embrace and it would make their life better? 00:55:09 [Speaker Changed] I think what people need to do is know themselves, right? Much more than you know, what’s the expense ratio on their index funds or you know, which is the best age of which to claim social security. Know yourself because everybody has different financial needs and different financial worries and so on. So if you customize your finances to your own needs, not to somebody else’s needs, not to what your brother-in-law says, not to what you heard on the tv. If you focus it to your own needs, what you worry about the most, you know, that is likely to lead you to have a happier financial life. I think one of the problems is that we live too much under the influence of others. It’s not just the influence of people today, you know, our friends and family and the people we see in the media, but also we live under the influence of the past, what our parents told us or what they modeled for us. You know, people go through their life buying what their parents bought because they thought it made their parents happy, and so they think it’s gonna make them happy. Probably not gonna work out that way. So try to think for yourself and try to know yourself. Huh. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Good, good advice. Let me throw you a curve ball. I remember last summer, towards the end of July, you were the focus of a New York Times piece headline, A Money Guru Bet, big on a very Long Life, then he Got Cancer. You’re usually the author of pieces like that. What, how odd was it to, to be the subject of a piece? I know you as a humble person, not just ’cause of the Humble Dollar website, you are not seeking to be the center of attention. How strange was that entire experience? 00:56:50 [Speaker Changed] Look, Barry, to be honest, sitting here, getting quizzed by you is not that difficult from getting, getting different from getting quizzed by Ron Lieber of the New York Times. But that said, yes, you know, I personally do not wanna be the center of attention. I would like the focus to be on my writing rather than me as a person. But, you know, I, I knew Ron was not gonna be unkind. I’ve known Ron for decades, right. He’s a, he’s a friend of mine. Much more uncomfortable actually was the photo shoot where I have to sit there and try to smile for an hour. Right, 00:57:22 Right. But it sort of goes back to what I was talking about earlier about the, the amount of publicity that my diagnosis has generated. I mean, since that came out, you know, I had the Wall Street Journal article that I wrote. I had, I wrote a piece for the Washington Post. I got a piece coming out in the a RP magazine. Ron Lieber wrote that piece for the New York Times. I also wrote a piece for my father’s old paper in London, the Telegraph, which was a lot of fun. Well, maybe not fun, but it was, it was great to be in there. So yeah, the focus on my, my diagnosis is a little bit odd. And certainly it’s uncomfortable for me to be the focus of attention wrong on my writing, but I feel in some way, in a way that I didn’t really realize that it’s, it’s, it’s doing some good and I, being of service to others has always been really important to me. I mean, I feel like if I’m not doing some little good in the world, I’m, I’m not spending my days usefully. I never wanna spend the days focused solely on my own needs. 00:58:28 [Speaker Changed] But you, you were able to use the opportunity to amplify the good message that you had for people, which was, hey, here’s just a fundamentally smart way to go about managing not just your investing, but your personal finance and your life. That focus must have been gratifying to get that message out. 00:58:47 [Speaker Changed] No, absolutely. I, it, it, it was, but it was also a little bit uncomfortable. 00:58:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I can, I can certainly see knowing you and knowing your personality, I can see it was something like, all right, let me, let me make this trade off. And, and, but it all seems to have accomplished the goal of sprinting what you wanted to share with the public. 00:59:09 [Speaker Changed] And, you know, for as long as I’m able, you know, I wanna be able to continue writing. I do have a whole bunch of articles that I still hope to pen, but, you know, I know this, this ride is gonna, is gonna come to an end probably sooner than I would like. But you know, for now, while I can still write, while I can still get my fingers on the keyboard, I hope to keep punching out a few more articles. 00:59:33 [Speaker Changed] So normally at this point, I shift to some of the favorite questions I ask all of my guests. I’m not sure how relevant these are, but, but let’s, let’s run through them for posterity stake. What’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you doing if you just want to kick back and relax a little bit? 00:59:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s not a, 00:59:54 [Speaker Changed] A, 00:59:55 [Speaker Changed] A thing. I’m very good at kicking back and relaxing. That said, you know, as I mentioned, you know, if I’m gonna be retired, which I don’t think I’ll ever be fully retired, this is the moment, right. If I don’t do it now, I’m never gonna get to do it. And for the first time in probably 20 years, I actually started watching sports again on tv, and it sort of takes me back to being a teenager and so on, sitting on the couch. I’m not sure I could ever sit through a whole football game, but maybe I could watch the final quarter. And so I’ve been trying a little bit of that. So, yeah. 01:00:30 [Speaker Changed] Have you played with Red Zone at all? No. My nephews are just crazy about it. It’s just the highlights of every big game, kind of all at once. It’s just, it’s an amazing, if you’re a football fan, you might wanna explore that. It’s, it’s pretty bonkers. 01:00:46 [Speaker Changed] So I live down in Philadelphia, so the Eagles are an obsession. Yeah. And you, you can’t help but catch a little bit of the fever on a Sunday afternoon. Half the people, and I’m not, this is not exaggeration. Half the people you see walking on the street are wearing Eagles gear. Wow. I mean, that’s how much of an obsession it is in the city. And it’s fun. You know, I, I’ve been taught by my son-in-law that when you go into a store in Philadelphia, you know, to buy something on a Sunday, what you have to say when you leave is Go Birds. 01:01:20 [Speaker Changed] That’s very funny. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:01:26 [Speaker Changed] So I would call out one person, which was the editor of this little newspaper that I worked for when I was 19. Her name was Leslie Levin. And she had just got out of the American University Journalism school. And she had all of this knowledge about journalism that she was anxious to pass on. And literally she, she taught me how to write. She taught me how to report. It was a great experience. I was so fortunate. And, and in fact, this was all before I went to college. And I took the advice that she gave me about, you know, how to run a small newspaper. And then I took it, and I used it when I edited the student newspaper at Cambridge. And I’ve used it ever since. So if I ever, for instance, see a piece of copy with an exclamation mark on it, I immediately hear Leslie’s voice in my back, my head saying, you only ever use the exclamation mark if it’s World War iii. Otherwise no exclamation marks. 01:02:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. Tell us about some of your favorite books. What have you been reading recently? 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] Lately I’ve been doing a lot of reading about Philadelphia and about the, the, the neighborhood where I live. I live very close to the Schuylkill River across from the Penn, the Penn UPenn campus. And where I live now, used to be full of Irish immigrants who worked on the wolves along the Schull. And next to me is a very, an elderly lady. I think she’s probably in her nineties, and her son lives with her, and he, he’s in his mid sixties. And Charlie tells me that when he was growing up in the neighborhood, there were two Italian families and everybody else was Irish. And the fact that he was aware that there were only two families in the neighborhood who were Italian and everybody else was Irish, tells you something about that neighborhood at the time. So I enjoy reading about Philadelphia, but I you, in terms of favorite books, the best time in terms of learning about finance was when I was at Forbes in the late 1980s. Back then, the workplace was less pressured, there’s less drive to produce, and there was more time to sort of sit, kick back and relax and read. And Forbes had a great library. So back in those days, you know, I read Burton Mals Random Walk Down Wall Street. I read all the books of Wall Street History by John Brooks, and I particularly remember 01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] Once Upon a Time in Goland, is that John Brooks? 01:03:57 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The Go-Go years. That’s right. And then there was this little book that I discovered in the Forbes library called Investment Policy by Charles Ellis. And Investment Policy, I believe, came out in 1986, and I think the original edition was 94 pages. And it just seemed like Charlie went through and picked out every word in that book with enormous care. Since then, the book has ballooned a little bit. It’s over 200 pages, but that, and it’s now of course called Winning the Losers Game. That’s 01:04:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. That, in fact, that would began life as a research paper. I don’t, I don’t remember if it was the CFA Institute, but it was published somewhere. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] I think it was the Journal of Portfolio Management. 01:04:41 [Speaker Changed] I think you’re you. That’s exactly right. But it was a short 2030 Yeah. Page thing, which has persisted. Winning The Losers Game is one of my favorite finance books. 01:04:50 [Speaker Changed] But, 01:04:51 [Speaker Changed] And you know, he, Charlie has a new book coming out this year. Yep. 01:04:54 [Speaker Changed] Charlie’s Unstoppable. Yes. If you can find Charlie’s original book, investment Policy, which is the one that I believe came out in 86, you know, it’s 94 pages. It’s a great read. And that, I think was probably the most influential book on investing that I’ve ever read. 01:05:12 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That’s a, that’s a big deal. I’m gonna have to hunt that down. I I may have to reactivate my eBay account to, to, to get that. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interest in the career in financial journalism or investing? 01:05:29 [Speaker Changed] Well, so I, I think I already answered the financial journalism one, which is don’t do it. I, I’m not entirely serious. I mean, journalism is the most fun you can have while keeping your clothes on. I mean, it’s, you know, newsrooms are great places to be. You know, you’ll never meet a group of people who are more fun to be with and more cynical. I mean, it’s just so much fun to be in a newsroom. So yeah, go off and be a journalist for a couple of years, learn how to write, learn about the world, and then go off and make, do something that’ll make you some money. But spending a couple of years in journalism in your twenties when you don’t really need to worry about making a lot of money is a great thing to do. So yeah, I would encourage people to do it, but don’t imagine you’re gonna make a career out of it. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today you wish you knew 30 years or so ago? 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] That’s an interesting question. What do I wish I knew? I guess what I wish I knew was to, was that if I did the right things for long enough, everything was gonna work out just fine. If, you know, as long as I saved as, as long as I didn’t fiddle around too much from my portfolio, if I just let it ride, you know, I could just go off and worry about other stuff, not worry about it at all. You know, things generally do work out today. You know, there are not many people, you know, who go into the world, out into the world and, you know, are reasonably prudent in managing money and so on, who don’t successfully get to retirement. You don’t need to fret about it every step of the way. You don’t need to analyze every month spending in quicker. And you, you don’t need to fine tune your portfolio every month, just, you know, set up a sensible asset allocation, buy some index funds, save regularly, and good things will happen. 01:07:14 [Speaker Changed] Jonathan, thank you so much for being so generous with your time and your incredibly insightful advice.

January 21, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Resilinc Resilinc MILPITAS, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resilinc, the leading provider of supply chain resiliency solutions, is sharing exclusive new data revealing the top drivers of supply chain disruptions for 2024. The data compiled by Resilinc’s EventWatchAI, a 24/7 risk monitoring database, reveals that overall disruptions to global supply chains increased 38% from the previous year. The top five disruptions for 2024 include: Factory fires maintained their position as the number one disruption for the sixth consecutive year, with 2,299 disruption alerts issued. Fortunately, this number is down 20% from the previous year and has declined 36% from the record high in 2022. Labor disruptions made it into the top five list for the second year in a row, jumping up to the second spot with a 47% year-over-year increase. Labor issues played a major role in impacting most industries in the U.S. and globally, including company and site-level strikes, national strikes, labor protests, and layoffs. From the ILA U.S. port strike, impacting over 47,000 workers, and the Canadian rail strike to major layoffs at tech giants Intel, Dell, and Amazon, labor disruptions continued its streak as a key risk area for 2024. Financial risk areas, including business sales, leadership transitions, and mergers and acquisitions, rounded out the top five disruptions for 2024. While business sales climbed a steady 17% YoY, leadership transitions surged 95% last year. Several notable transitions included leadership changes at Boeing, Nestlé, Pfizer Limited, and Intel. While mergers and acquisitions saw a slight decline of 5%, they remained a top disruption for 2024. Though the number of disruption alerts increased overall, several risk areas experienced substantial year-over-year increases; for example, extreme weather jumped a dramatic 119%. Consistent with this trend, flood-related alerts surged by 214%, forest fires increased by 88%, and hurricanes/typhoons jumped by 101%, underscoring the growing impact of extreme weather risks. Other noteworthy trends highlighted in the data include a 146% rise in labor violations such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and health and safety violations, among others. Geopolitical risk alerts climbed 123% after a brief dip in 2023, and protests/riots saw an astounding 285% YoY increase, marking the largest growth increase of all risk events tracked by Resilinc. Regulatory change alerts, which include tariffs, changes in laws, environmental regulations, and bans, continued their upward trend with a 128% YoY increase. The five most disrupted industries included Life Sciences, Healthcare, General Manufacturing, High Tech, and Automotive, marking the fourth year in a row that these particular industries have been the most impacted. Of all the 22,522 EventWatchAI notifications sent, more than half (59%) were impactful enough to trigger the creation of a WarRoom—virtual platforms in the Resilinc dashboard where customers and their suppliers communicate and collaborate to assess and resolve disruptions—emphasizing that disruptions not only increased in 2024 but also had a heightened impact on global supply chains. Resilinc’s data is gathered by its 24/7 global event monitoring Artificial Intelligence, EventWatch AI, which collects information and monitors news on 400 different types of disruptions across 104 million sources including traditional news sources, social media platforms, wire services, videos, and government reports.

Title: Indie Agencies Seek a Competitive Edge as Talent Rejects WPP Office Mandate

Time Published: 2025-01-21T11:00:00Z

The stage is set! Advertisers, don't miss this cultural moment. ADWEEK House The Big Game is headed to New Orleans on February 7. RSVP. WPP made a bold move last week as the first major company in the ad industry to mandate that its 100,000-plus employees around the globe must return to the office four days per week. Five years on from the pandemic, there are legitimate reasons to return. Following in the footsteps of other major corporations, from Amazon to Toyota, WPP executives are eager to increase productivity, strengthen culture, and utilize dormant office space. But the decision has gotten under the skin of many employees who thrive working remotely or in a hybrid role, who have caregiving responsibilities at home—or who simply don’t appreciate being told where to work. A petition started by WPP employees on Change.org pushing back on the mandate has garnered more than 16,000 signatures so far. WPP is not the only holding company to enforce a return to office. Publicis employees were told to return three days per week, and dozens were laid off late last year for violating the policy. But none have pushed the mandate beyond three days in-person. That’s in contrast to big clients including JPMorgan Chase, Google, IBM, Apple, and Uber, which have ordered workers back to the office full time, with some threatening job cuts for non-compliance. Undoubtedly, the aggressive mandate will push some WPP staffers to seek job alternatives that are more flexible—and agencies who promote those policies may reap the rewards. “A-plus talent has choice,” Jared Belsky, CEO of independent media agency Acadia, told ADWEEK. “They want to work where they feel empowered and trusted. It’s hard to say ‘we trust you’ and then say ‘we are checking your badges to make sure you are here four times per week.’” Scott Brandon, CEO at agency Brandon, said that WPP’s policy reflects an old-school approach in an industry that thrives on evolution. “Rigid mandates risk alienating top performers who know their best work isn’t tied to a cubicle,” he said. “The backlash here isn’t surprising—people are looking for agencies that prioritize results and culture over arbitrary rules.” Jeff Levick, CEO of We Are Rosie, a fully remote company which offers brands flexible agency staffing, added that most return to office policies come from the CFO to justify expenses—but that creatives often work best with flexibility. Kandi Gongora, chief transformation and people officer at Goodway Group, added that office mandates will also limit holding companies from being able to hire the best talent across the country. “This ultimately leads to unsatisfied, unproductive employees in search of greater autonomy and far less access to incredible talent that exists outside of geographical barriers,” she said. While there are viable reasons for people to be in the office, agencies should prioritize those most impactful moments for people to come in, whether that’s to meet with clients, brainstorm with their teams, pitch new business, or build camaraderie, said Andrew Graff, CEO of independent agency Allen & Gerritson (A&G). Mandates must also be thought through carefully, particularly for agencies that downsized office space during the pandemic. WPP staffers are already grumbling about where they will work, as available desks and meeting rooms may be at a minimum, according The Drum. These are all kinks WPP will have to work out as it works through the logistics of an office return. Sasha Martens, founder of Sasha the Mensch, an international headhunting firm, believes independents stand to benefit most from WPP’s mandate, as staffers worry other holding companies will follow suit. “You’re more likely going to see some of the bigger companies say four days a week as well. What that does is open the door for more flexible and independent companies,” Martens told ADWEEK. With Omnicom’s takeover of IPG also spooking talent in fear of layoffs and priority changes, independent agencies could have an advantage. Indeed, Belsky said Acadia has “already seen resumes starting to trickle in, and I would predict we see more.” Levick agrees that flexible businesses like its own will benefit, as We Are Rosie has seen an uptick in resumes in response to return-to-office mandates in the past. “We’re entering this new marketplace where people can decide how they want to work, and if they want to go to the office,” he said. Agencies say a return to office will foster the creative alchemy that happens when teams work together in person. But those who are flexible can still come together with intention , without telling employees what to do. A&G redesigned its offices in Boston and Philadelphia with an eye on flexibility and community for that reason, inviting community members to share the space with it. “Your first space is your home. Your second space is the office. And the third space are those places where you gather and be social but still may conduct business,” said CEO Andrew Graff. “For an industry that is about creativity, I would think we could be a little bit more creative on how we think about these policies or mandates.” Agencies are businesses, and real estate is a substantial investment that they must justify. But disengaged talent can be just as costly in terms of lost innovation, diminished morale, and turnover. “The future of our industry isn’t about going back to the way things were—it’s about finding sustainable solutions that support strong outcomes and a workplace that works for everyone, wherever they are,” said Brooks Luquire, CEO at agency Luquire. Though “human interactions breed creativity,” according to Devin Reiter, president at agency Fortnight Collective, and most agencies are looking for some level of return, flexibility is now a big differentiator. “What the industry needs is balance,” said John Geletka, CXO and founder of Gelekta+. “People need to work together, and work hard, but then need the room after long nights of work to get some home-time and take care of their lives.” Study: Ad Agencies’ Return-to-Office Mandates Pose Hiring and Retention Challenges Kyle O’Brien is a staff reporter for Adweek and editor of AgencySpy.

Title: America needs to pull off a colossal building plan to reach a new 'Intelligence Age'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/america-intelligence-age-ai-infrastructure-sam-altman-biden-trump-china-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:45:37Z
Full Content:
America is ready to reach a new age of intelligence. Getting there —and staying ahead of rival nations in the AI race — depends on a plan to transform the physical world that's becoming more formidable by the day. Leaders driving the AI boom entered 2025 by getting louder about the radical transformation they say is needed on US soil to deliver an era of AI-led superintelligence: more data centers, more chip plants, and more power infrastructure. By taking root in the physical world — huge data center facilities depend on complex wiring, hardware, and integration with power infrastructure across vast amounts of landmass — the hope is that AI software could one day transform society the way the Industrial Age did. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, calls this next leap the "Intelligence Age." In a September blog post, Altman said its defining characteristic would be "massive prosperity." However, he cautioned that without enough infrastructure, "AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." Last week, in one of his final executive orders, President Joe Biden signaled intent to build more at home with plans to lease acres of federal land to private sector firms with the know-how to develop complex AI infrastructure. The intent to build is likely to continue after Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, as tech leaders rally around the incoming president and put AI among the top priorities on his agenda. Biden's executive order followed the release of a blueprint from OpenAI a day earlier, which claimed "the economic opportunity AI presents is too compelling to forfeit" by not building the infrastructure needed. Data centers, power plants, and chip manufacturing plants will all cost money — a lot of money. Goldman Sachs estimates that roughly $1 trillion will be spent in the next few years alone to develop the infrastructure needed to bring today's AI models closer to superintelligence. It's why the big question investors and companies must now grapple with is whether or not they are willing to put up money for a vision of the future that is hardly guaranteed. Altman has offered no shortage of reasons for spending so much money on achieving superintelligence. Ensuring technological hegemony over China is one. As his company said last week, "there's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects" that "will flow to China-backed projects" and strengthen Beijing if not directed to the US. Another is that superintelligence could unlock unimaginable prosperity for society. Altman recently said that "if we could fast-forward a hundred years," the prosperity from superintelligence would feel just as unimaginable as today's world would to a lamplighter, a person employed to light and maintain street lights until about the 1950s. The third reason is perhaps more surprising. In a blog published at the start of the year, Altman said his company is now confident that it knows how to build artificial general intelligence, a term often interchanged with superintelligence despite their differences. It's a combination of factors that will, in some way, have triggered the flood of comments from those who want to play their part in developing the infrastructure needed to deliver superintelligence. In a blog published this month titled "The Golden Opportunity for American AI," Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company planned to spend $80 billion alone this year on data centers. "Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation's economy," he said. Last year, in conjunction with BlackRock and others, the tech giant unveiled a fund focused on AI infrastructure with an investment potential of up to $100 billion. In an interview with Semafor last month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that he was ready to work on a "Manhattan Project" for AI once Donald Trump takes office, underscoring the scale of the development and investment needed by invoking the World War II program that eventually produced the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank committed $100 billion to investing in the US over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. While there is clear intent to develop AI infrastructure, it's not clear if or when the investments will pay off — for two key reasons. First, much of the infrastructure needed in the US faces an uphill struggle to get built. Take chip plants. US companies like Nvidia, Google, AMD, and others that specialize in designing chips have developed a significant reliance on Taiwanese firm TSMC to manufacture those chips in the Far East, where a combination of cheap, skilled labor, economies of scale, and a long history of government support for the semiconductor sector has made the incredibly expensive business of manufacturing chips easier to pull-off. Simply throwing capital at projects aimed at getting chips manufactured in the US won't cut it. Efforts to build chip manufacturing plants at home have been taking shape — the Biden administration's CHIPS Act has provided billions of dollars of grants to semiconductor firms in the US — but there remains a huge gap between the capabilities of manufacturers in the East versus those at home. The AI boom has been kind to TSMC, with its value roughly doubling last year to $1.1 trillion. US chip manufacturer Intel, meanwhile, more than halved to around $85 billion. Clean power infrastructure, increasingly focused on nuclear power, also faces challenges. Returns on investment in nuclear power projects meant to provide clean energy to intensive data centers are highly uncertain. These projects also face significant regulatory hurdles. In December, for instance, the States of Texas, Utah, and Washington D.C.-based company Last Energy sued the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over claims that the government agency was applying the same risk analysis to small modular reactors as it was to large-scale power plants. These SMRs, as they're known, are meant to make access to nuclear power cheaper, given their compactness and greater affordability versus traditional nuclear plants. But even these face roadblocks. The second big reason that investors may want to approach infrastructure investment with caution is that the emergence of superintelligence remains highly speculative. Altman's claim that there is now a clear path to AGI is worth taking seriously, as new models like OpenAI's o3 released in December demonstrate increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities that do more than just parrot their training data. That said, there have been rumblings across the industry recently about AI models hitting a wall in terms of performance improvements. Without really serious advances in capabilities, then, or a clearly defined path forward to superintelligence, it is not clear how or when these colossal bets on AI infrastructure will pay off. But with China and other nations showing no sign of slowing down, it is clear that the cost of not being in the AI race could be far greater. Jump to

One of the most interesting asset managers in Europe has made it to America. Lingotto Investment Management, with $6 billion in assets under management, has generated plenty of intrigue in its short existence. It was formed in 2023 by Exor, the holding company for the wealth of the Agnelli family, which owns Fiat, Ferrari, The Economist, and the Italian soccer team Juventus. Lingotto launched as an investment house giving tenured portfolio managers a sleeve of capital and free range to invest — some bets include a private German robotics company and CBS's parent company, Paramount. The firm, which was founded by the billionaire Agnelli heir John Elkann and whose chair is former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, has raised billions in outside capital and is operated separately from Exor. Now the manager is expanding to New York, where it already has 14 employees, including investing talent, on the ground. The 50-person firm, based in London, considers New York and London to be its "two pillars," Enrico Vellano, Lingotto's CEO, said in an interview with Business Insider. "The idea is to continue to grow and invest in the US but also in the UK," he said. The firm has lured in James Anderson, a star tech investor and former Baillie Gifford partner, and BlackRock executive Pam Chan to run different strategies. Matteo Scolari and Nikhil Srinivasan, two longtime Exor-connected investors, manage their own books. The investors' focuses are across the board — limited-partner stakes in other funds, public tech companies, quirky private opportunities — and they can pursue their ideas on their own timelines, which can be yearslong, without constant tinkering from a central risk manager or overarching investment commitment. This proposition has been enticing to portfolio managers as well as prospective backers. "Each team is empowered and very independent," said Scolari, whose ties to the Agnelli family go back a generation to when his father worked as the head of research and development at Fiat decades ago. In an interview with BI, he said the structure set the firm apart. "I think that's really important — I really believe in this approach," he added. The firm doesn't like the word "platform," but it's impossible to avoid comparisons between today's dominant multistrategy managers and Lingotto. These platforms have become some of the biggest names in alternative investing, in part because they can absorb so much capital from sovereign wealth funds and pensions and diversify it across dozens of investing teams. The industry's biggest investors prefer multistrategy funds because of their consistency and lack of volatility, which they achieve through tight risk limits and short-term investment horizons. Lingotto employs multiple investors who operate quasi-independently of each other, like Citadel and Millennium. But the similarities between Lingotto and the biggest hedge funds end there. At Lingotto, the ultimate authority over its four strategies lies with the heads of said strategies. There's no firmwide chief investment officer but four different CIOs. "I really liked the idea of the autonomy," Anderson said in an interview with BI. He runs the firm's $700 million innovation strategy alongside Morgan Samet, the strategy's cohead who used to work for the value-investment shop Pzena and the private-equity firm THL. The innovation team plans to invest in companies across their life cycle, including when they are private, and hold them through volatile patches. "You need to be prepared to suffer," said Anderson, who was an early investor in Tesla and Amazon and a big believer in Nvidia's potential. "Where we earn our returns is by being supporters of these companies during their downturns," he added. The long-term nature of the firm's capital, thanks to Exor's role in the formation of the company, allows Anderson and Samet — and the firm's three other strategy heads — to worry less about short-term gains and more about long-term ideas. "We're not scared of volatility," Samet said. "We see that as more of an opportunity, " she added. While the firm wants to be viewed as more than just the investment arm of the Agnelli family — and already has outside capital from the French insurer Covéa — Lingotto is the brainchild of Elkann, the billionaire heir. In a public letter after the firm launched, Elkann quoted the 18th-century philosopher Adam Smith to stress how his family would be investing alongside any outside capital. "Above all, we think and act as principals rather than agents," he wrote. Lingotto, named after an iconic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy, with a rooftop test track that began operations in 1923, plans to grow through "performance rather than capital inflows," he added. The first to run strategies for the firm were a pair of longtime family connections, Scolari and Srinivasan, who now run the intersection and horizon strategies, respectively. Scolari previously worked for Eton Park, the now shuttered hedge fund founded by the former Goldman Sachs partner Eric Mindich, and joined Exor in 2015. Srinivasan, meanwhile, was the chief investment officer at Allianz Investment Management and an HPS partner before joining Exor in 2018. The pair have very different strategies — Scolari runs a concentrated book of public equity longs and shorts, while Srinivasan manages a portfolio of other funds as well as direct investments into private companies — but similar experiences working at the firm. Without the pressures of managing a business, the two chief investment officers can focus on their main job: investing. "You have a pool of capital, you have trust from the LPs and GPs, and you have clarity for what you're supposed to be doing from an investment point of view," said Srinivasan, who invests in companies around the globe and spoke with BI from Singapore. "The stresses created are our own stresses," he added. With the firm's momentum and burgeoning reputation, it might seem like the next step would be a significant hiring spree to grow the ranks even further. While Lingotto's leaders are always looking for top people, Vellano said the firm wanted the right people for the structure, not just more people. Chan, a former BlackRock private-markets executive, is an example. Chan, who is based in New York and runs the mosaic strategy, said her portfolio was focused on the parts of the private markets that don't fit neatly into the buckets of the biggest private-asset managers. Right now, for example, she's got her eyes on the content industry, including nontraditional players like YouTube creators. "Novelty is a big part of what we do," she said. She was early into the music-rights business, something massive asset managers like KKR have now gotten into. She focuses on areas where there's a "capital demand-supply imbalance," a time-intensive strategy that requires her and her team to scour the market for deals. She said Lingotto's structure gives her the bandwidth to do that by "allowing investors to invest." It fits neatly into Vellano's vision. "We will remain a boutique" that focuses on "quality investors and LPs," he said, adding: "It's important we have that alignment." Jump to

Title: What To Expect From Bank Of America Stock In 2025?

Bank of America branch office, exterior view, New York City, New York, USA. (Photo by: GHI-Plexi ... [+] Images/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Bank of America’s stock (NYSE: BAC) posted a better-than-expected set of Q4 2024 earnings, led by stronger investment banking business and higher net interest income. Net profits more than doubled year-over-year to $6.67 billion, or $0.82 per share, while revenues were up 15% to $25.5 billion. Net interest income - the difference in between the interest banks earn on loans and pay for deposits - was up by 3% to $14.5 billion, coming in slightly ahead of estimates. The investment banking business was a particularly strong performer over Q4, with fees up 44% to $1.65 billion. Mergers and acquisitions activity has picked up from nearly a decade-low in 2023. Companies have also been focusing on issuing more debt and equity capital. Sales and trading revenue were up 10% over the quarter, with equities up 6% while fixed income, currencies, and commodities were up by an even stronger 13%. The broader U.S. banking sector has been faring well this earnings season led by rising stock markets which helped trading activity, softer interest rates, stronger dealmaking activity, and general positivity about the economy. For instance, Bank of America’s rival JPMorgan just reported record annual profits for 2024, while Goldman Sachs has also seen profits pick up after witnessing a post-Covid lull. Separately, in the cryptocurrency world, see Solana Price To $400 Next? The increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, 5% in 2023, and 34% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Looking ahead, things could get better. Higher interest rates in recent years weighed on lenders as they had to pay more interest to depositors. However, with the Fed easing rates since September, we could see this softening in the near term helping drive up loan demand while lowering the costs of deposits. Bank of America expects NII of as much as $14.6 billion for Q1 2025 and has indicated that the metric could grow sequentially every quarter this year, reaching as much as $15.7 billion by Q4. NII is an important metric for Bank Of America, as it has a large deposit base compared to rivals. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could directly boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Bank Of America. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking and M&A-related activity. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Overall, at its current price of $47 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis’ estimate for Bank of America’s valuation.

Title: The race for the next Ozempic is on
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-eli-lilly-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-drugs-1851737399
Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.19%) CagriSema and Amgen’s (AMGN-0.52%) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling. These setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it’s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market. These medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm — especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+1.93%) Zepbound. The weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS-0.55%) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population — 31.5 million people — are expected to be using them by 2035. With that much money at stake, it’s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow. Several pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections — an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. Eli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. “Retatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),” president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss. Amgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a “convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.” Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+2.77%): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment. Zealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight. Pharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages. Novo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results. Eli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill — orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Pfizer (PFE-1.14%): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects. Viking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk’s amycretin. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stocks Whipsaw, Dollar Rises on Trump Warnings: Markets Wrap

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Stocks climbed as President Donald Trump struck a better-than-feared tone on global trade and speculation grew that his policies will further boost Corporate America. Bonds continued to unwind the recent surge in yields that roiled markets. The dollar wavered.

A closely watched exchange-traded fund tracking companies with AI exposure hit a three-year high. Small caps climbed on bets they will benefit from a protectionist stance.

Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.​​​​​​ Treasury yields hovered near their lowest levels of the year. Mexico’s peso and Canada’s loonie got hit as Trump outlined levies he expects to place on both countries by Feb. 1. “Risky assets should benefit from deregulation and tariffs emerging as not so bad as feared,” said Mohit Kumar at Jefferies International Ltd. “For rates, less onerous tariffs and likely lower oil prices should be a positive.” Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management, says it’s time to see what speculation was “founded” and what was “just nonsense” when it comes to tariffs. Meantime, she noted that Trump faces a crucial test on another front. “We’ll start seeing more headlines around debt-ceiling talks, and possibly, more stress on the shorter end of the Treasury curve,” she said. The debt ceiling is frequently used for leverage amid budget negotiations in Congress, with agreements often made at the last minute. As a result, the standoffs typically ripple through short-term interest rates as investors dump Treasury bills most vulnerable to a potential default in favor of other securities. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2%. The Russell 2000 of small caps rallied 1.8%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps added 0.3%. In late hours, Netflix Inc. soared after reporting its biggest quarterly subscriber gain in history. United Airlines Holdings Inc. issued a bullish outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.56%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed. “Last week, the equity markets experienced a broad rally, supported by cooler inflation data, upbeat earnings from banks, and a recovery from short-term oversold conditions and negative sentiment,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “We expect further upside in equities, supported by the return of Trump’s ‘business and investor-friendly’ policies. The “presidential scorecard” of stock-market performance is resetting this Tuesday, with Trump beginning his day in the White House for the first time in four years. For Joe Biden’s entire presidency, the Dow Jones Industrial average rallied 39.4% — about 18 percentage points less than the four years under his Trump’s first administration — and over 100 percentage points less than the 149.4% during the eight years of the Obama era, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. “While the Dow’s performance under Biden was the weakest of the last three presidents, it was still nothing to sneeze at, and it caps off a third straight period of strong gains under a presidential term,” Bespoke said. “Let these performance numbers serve as a reminder that as an investor you should never let your politics and investment decisions overlap.” Since 1944, from the election through the inauguration day, the S&P 500 gained an average 1.6%, according to Sam Stovall at CFRA. During the subsequent “First 100 (calendar) Days”, the S&P 500 gained an average of 2.1%, he noted. “What’s more, the performances of S&P 500 sectors and sub-industries during the ‘Post-Election Honeymoon Period’ have been predictive of sector and sub-industry leadership for the entire year,” Stovall added. Since 1993, the top four sectors from election day through inauguration day posted an average calendar-year increase of 17% versus the S&P 500’s average 15.9% rise and outperformed the broad benchmark 75% of the time, Stovall said. Even better, the top-10 S&P 500 sub-industries posted an average calendar-year increase of 26.8% and also beat the market 75% of the time, he concluded. This time around, there are early signs that investors are preparing for equity laggards to rally on bets that Trump could take a softer-than-feared stance on global trade, according to a survey by Bank of America Corp. If concerns around Trump’s tariff proposals prove to be “unfounded,” investor allocations would remain risk-on and stock markets that have trailed the powerful rally in the US would play catch up, BofA strategist Michael Hartnett said. In what could be a different macro/market regime in 2025, with a moderate pick-up in economic growth, we want to look for other equity markets that have reversion potential and have positive earnings revisions, according to Emily Roland and Matt Miskin at John Hancock Investment Management. “US large-cap value (financials heavy) and US mid-caps (industrials heavy) are the two best options across globally equities that offer reversion potential and improving earnings trends,” they noted. “Non-US equities and US small-caps could get a boost simply from the rotation trends, but fundamentally not as strong.” Roland and Miskin also added that investors don’t have to go far to benefit from the potential deconcentration of the S&P 500 from the top 10 mostly technology-driven growth stocks. “Simply a value tilt or moving down in cap a bit, may give them plenty of fundamentally favorable opportunities,” they concluded. “Our base case for the US economy is for ‘growth despite tariffs’,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “While we will be closely monitoring for risks, we do not believe that the tariff measures outlined in our base case would be sufficient to derail US growth. Nor do we believe that such tariffs would preclude inflation continuing to fall from current levels, enabling the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50bps later this year.” The latest dovish inflation readings are “game-changers,” and should provide a Goldilocks backdrop for risk assets over the coming months, HSBC says. The bank’s strategists led by Max Kettner expect only very shallow drawdowns in the coming months and would use any dips to boost risk asset exposure. They say sentiment and positioning are still flashing a buy signal. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, while many of the headlines related to Trump’s policies could have an important impact on the markets, earnings season — and forward guidance — should be extremely important as well. “With the market as expensive as it is today, there are some concerns about whether the positive aspects of these new policies may have already been priced into the stock market,” Maley said. “So, it’s going to be particularly important that the overall earnings picture does not begin to deteriorate in any meaningful manner.” Corporate Highlights: Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst. Charles Schwab Corp. reported results that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it continues to attract record inflows to its retail brokerage. 3M Co. expects profit to grow this year as Chief Executive Officer William Brown works to advance his plan to turn around the sprawling manufacturer. D.R. Horton Inc. reported earnings per share for the first quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. MicroStrategy Inc. shareholders voted for a 30 times increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares to help finance the company’s Bitcoin buying. B. Riley Financial Inc. suspended dividends on a pair of its preferred shares, holding off on cash payments to some investors while it prepares to pay off another set of notes coming due next month. Adidas AG reported better-than-expected results amid the sustained boom for retro sneakers like the Samba and more sales from its shrinking stockpile of Yeezy footwear.

Title: Corporate America, including TECH GIANTS and BIG PHARMA, opens wallets wide for Trump’s second inauguration â contributing over $170 million to shatter previous record

Corporate America has contributed unprecedented sums, exceeding $170 million, to Donald Trump's second inauguration, marking a significant shift in business relationships with the president. Major corporations, including tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, as well as auto manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, have increased their donations,Â some more than tripling their contributions from previous inaugurations. The surge in donations reflects a change in corporate America's view of Trump, moving from initial skepticism to a desire to curry favor with the unpredictable but influential figure. Companies are more transparent in announcing their donations, signaling a shift in attitude towards Trump compared to his first inauguration and the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration.

The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration. Corporate America has poured unprecedented sums into President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony and related events, signaling a dramatic shift in the business world's relationship with the polarizing political figure. According to the New York Times, Trump's inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million, shattering the previous record set during his first inauguration in 2017. This surge in donations reflects a calculated effort by major corporations to curry favor with a man known for his unpredictability and penchant for rewarding loyalty â or punishing perceived slights. Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, along with CEOs from Apple and OpenAI, are among the top contributors. Auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and financial firms have also opened their checkbooks, with many publicly announcing their donations months before federal disclosure requirements kick in. This marks a stark contrast to Trump's first inauguration, when corporate America approached him with skepticism, and to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when many companies distanced themselves from him. The record-breaking fundraising haul underscores a significant change in how corporate America views Trump. During his first campaign and presidency, many companies were hesitant to align themselves with a figure whose rhetoric and policies often sparked controversy. However, eight years later, businesses appear to have adapted to Trump's transactional style of governance. "The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, is no longer there," said Brian Ballard, a longtime Trump fundraiser who has helped raise money for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. "Who knows what's going to happen two months from now? But for today, up and down, corporate America is solidly pro-Trump." This shift is evident in the size and transparency of the donations. Microsoft, for example, contributed $1 million â doubling its donations for Trump's 2017 and former President Joe Biden's 2021 inaugurations. Google, which gave $285,000 to both Trump's first inauguration and Biden's, more than tripled its contribution to $1 million this time. Big names, big checks The list of donors reads like a who's who of corporate America. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft each contributed at least $1 million, as did the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI. Auto manufacturers Toyota, Ford and General Motors also donated $1 million a piece, alongside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, telehealth company Hims & Hers, and tax service Intuit. Robinhood, the stock trading app, contributed $2 million. (Related: A strategic investment: Meta donates $1M to Trump inauguration fund.) In a sign of how eager these companies are to publicize their support, spokespeople for many firms quickly confirmed their donations to Politico. Chevron and Bank of America also acknowledged contributions but declined to specify amounts. "Everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor with the new administration," said a healthcare lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. "We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one." The surge in donations reflects a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Trump's second inauguration comes amid ongoing legal battles, including felony convictions and promises to pardon participants in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Yet, these controversies have done little to deter corporate America from seeking influence with the incoming administration. The record-breaking fundraising for Trump's second inauguration highlights the evolving relationship between corporate America and the president. Once viewed with skepticism, Trump is now seen as a figure whose favor is worth courting, even at a high price. For businesses, the donations represent a calculated investment in access and influence, as well as an acknowledgment of Trump's enduring impact on American politics.

DNC fundraiser now critical of party's "$1 billion disaster" of a presidential campaign. Trump to sign executive order designating cryptocurrency as a national priority on inauguration day. Sources include: ZeroHedge.com Statista.com Politico.com Brighteon.com The record-breaking fundraising haul underscores a significant change in how corporate America views Trump. During his first campaign and presidency, many companies were hesitant to align themselves with a figure whose rhetoric and policies often sparked controversy. However, eight years later, businesses appear to have adapted to Trump's transactional style of governance. "The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, is no longer there," said Brian Ballard, a longtime Trump fundraiser who has helped raise money for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. "Who knows what's going to happen two months from now? But for today, up and down, corporate America is solidly pro-Trump." This shift is evident in the size and transparency of the donations. Microsoft, for example, contributed $1 million â doubling its donations for Trump's 2017 and former President Joe Biden's 2021 inaugurations. Google, which gave $285,000 to both Trump's first inauguration and Biden's, more than tripled its contribution to $1 million this time. Big names, big checks The list of donors reads like a who's who of corporate America. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft each contributed at least $1 million, as did the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI. Auto manufacturers Toyota, Ford and General Motors also donated $1 million a piece, alongside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, telehealth company Hims & Hers, and tax service Intuit. Robinhood, the stock trading app, contributed $2 million. (Related: A strategic investment: Meta donates $1M to Trump inauguration fund.)

Chevron and Bank of America also acknowledged contributions but declined to specify amounts. "Everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor with the new administration," said a healthcare lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. "We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one." The surge in donations reflects a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Trump's second inauguration comes amid ongoing legal battles, including felony convictions and promises to pardon participants in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Yet, these controversies have done little to deter corporate America from seeking influence with the incoming administration. The record-breaking fundraising for Trump's second inauguration highlights the evolving relationship between corporate America and the president. Once viewed with skepticism, Trump is now seen as a figure whose favor is worth courting, even at a high price.

Full Content:
Homeowners in California and the Carolinas face uninsurable properties due to frequent natural disasters, leading to plummeting home values and a potential "reverse wealth effect." Insurers are exiting high-risk markets, leaving homeowners with unsellable properties as banks refuse mortgages for uninsurable homes, exacerbating financial instability. The state's "Fair Plan" insurer may face $437 billion in potential payouts, risking bankruptcy and shifting the burden to taxpayers amid widespread uninsurable homes. Declining property values reduce local tax revenues, strain public services, and drive up insurance premiums, while inflation further increases costs for insurers and homeowners. Experts recommend diversifying into physical assets like gold, silver, and real estate, alongside preparing for economic instability as traditional financial systems falter.

A growing insurance crisis is unfolding across high-risk areas in the United States, leaving homeowners in states like California and the Carolinas facing a dire financial reality. In an exclusive interview on Decentralize TV, financial analyst John Rubino joined hosts Mike Adams and Todd Pitner to discuss the alarming trend of uninsurable homes, plummeting property values, and the potential for a "reverse wealth effect" that could ripple through the economy. The crisis stems from the increasing frequency and severity of natural disastersâwildfires in California and hurricanes in the Carolinasâwhich have overwhelmed insurance companies. As Rubino explained, "Insurance companies are pulling out of these markets because they can't turn a profit insuring multi-million dollar houses in Hurricane Alley or Southern California." This exodus has left homeowners with rebuilt but unsellable properties, as banks refuse to issue mortgages for uninsurable homes. The situation is particularly dire in California, where the state's "Fair Plan," an insurer of last resort, may be on the hook for up to $437 billion in potential payouts, according to Bloomberg analysis. Rubino warned that this could bankrupt the state, shifting the financial burden to taxpayers. "When you've got 100,000 people with uninsurable and unsellable houses, you get a thing called the reverse wealth effect," he said. The reverse wealth effect occurs when declining asset values, such as plummeting home prices, lead to reduced consumer spending and economic contraction. Rubino compared the current crisis to the 2008 housing collapse, where overextended banks and unaffordable mortgages triggered a financial meltdown. "If a house can't be insured, it's not worth nearly the prices that have prevailed for the last decade," he said. "Prices have to plungeâmaybe 20%, 30%, or 40%âto clear the market." The implications extend beyond individual homeowners. As property values decline, local governments face reduced tax revenues, further straining public services. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for those who can still obtain coverage are skyrocketing, adding to the financial burden. Rubino also highlighted the role of inflation in exacerbating the crisis. "We've been debasing the dollar for the past 50 years, and one of the effects is that it makes property more expensive," he explained. "When houses go up in value, insurance companies have a bigger bill to pay off when that house burns down. Inflation is part of the process of making these houses uninsurable." The hosts and Rubino also explored potential solutions, including the need for decentralized financial strategies. Adams emphasized the importance of owning physical assets like gold and silver, which retain value during economic turmoil. "Gold and silver survive hurricanes, floods, firesâit's on the table of elements," Adams said. "There's nothing more secure in the universe." Rubino echoed this sentiment, recommending that individuals allocate at least 10% of their financial assets to precious metals. He also suggested investing in real assets like rental properties, energy infrastructure, and commodities like copper, which are essential for the electrification of the global economy. The conversation took a speculative turn as Pitner raised the possibility of conspiracy theories, including weather weaponization and government manipulation of financial systems. While Rubino acknowledged the plausibility of such scenarios, he emphasized the importance of focusing on tangible risks and preparing for economic instability. As the interview concluded, Rubino left viewers with a sobering reminder: "The crash that results from this is going to be a lot bigger than we've ever seen. We've bought ourselves extra time, but at the cost of an even bigger crash when the time comes." For homeowners in high-risk areas, the message is clear: prepare for a future where traditional financial systems may no longer provide security. Whether through decentralized assets, alternative investments, or self-sufficiency, the time to act is nowâbefore the next disaster strikes.

The conversation took a speculative turn as Pitner raised the possibility of conspiracy theories, including weather weaponization and government manipulation of financial systems. While Rubino acknowledged the plausibility of such scenarios, he emphasized the importance of focusing on tangible risks and preparing for economic instability. As the interview concluded, Rubino left viewers with a sobering reminder: "The crash that results from this is going to be a lot bigger than we've ever seen. We've bought ourselves extra time, but at the cost of an even bigger crash when the time comes." For homeowners in high-risk areas, the message is clear: prepare for a future where traditional financial systems may no longer provide security. Whether through decentralized assets, alternative investments, or self-sufficiency, the time to act is nowâbefore the next disaster strikes.

As property values decline, local governments face reduced tax revenues, further straining public services. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for those who can still obtain coverage are skyrocketing, adding to the financial burden. Rubino also highlighted the role of inflation in exacerbating the crisis. "We've been debasing the dollar for the past 50 years, and one of the effects is that it makes property more expensive," he explained. "When houses go up in value, insurance companies have a bigger bill to pay off when that house burns down. Inflation is part of the process of making these houses uninsurable."

Title: Federal Reserve, BlackRock retreat from climate coalitions as economic realities take precedence
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-01-21-federal-reserve-blackrock-retreat-from-climate-coalitions.html

Full Content:
The Fed has withdrawn from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), emphasizing its focus on monetary stability and rejecting the politicization of climate policy, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell argues is outside the central bank's mandate. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), leading to the suspension of the coalition. This move reflects growing financial and political pressures, particularly from Republican-led states, which accuse BlackRock of prioritizing ESG goals over fiduciary duties. Major energy corporations like BP and Shell are reducing their climate commitments, focusing on profitability and energy security. This shift highlights the economic challenges of transitioning to renewable energy, which remains dependent on subsidies. Nations pursuing net-zero goals are experiencing economic repercussions, including rising energy prices and public discontent. The U.S. is projected to spend $825 billion on clean energy subsidies over the next decade, with costs disproportionately affecting working-class households. The retreat from climate coalitions suggests a need for more realistic and economically viable approaches to energy and environmental challenges. Policymakers are encouraged to prioritize energy reliability, affordability and innovation over ideologically driven mandates.

The retreat from climate coalitions suggests a need for more realistic and economically viable approaches to energy and environmental challenges. Policymakers are encouraged to prioritize energy reliability, affordability and innovation over ideologically driven mandates. In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserveâs withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRockâs exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve: Staying in its lane The Federal Reserveâs decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bankâs purview. âClimate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,â Powell stated, reflecting the Fedâs reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fedâs exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRockâs exit and the collapse of NZAM BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRockâs departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. Corporations scale back climate pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europeâs energy crisis. The cost of climate ambition The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UKâs climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decadeâfar exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. A pragmatic path forward The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology. Sources include: WattsUpWithThat.com Reuters.com FastCompany.com Reuters.com The Federal Reserve: Staying in its lane The Federal Reserveâs decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bankâs purview. âClimate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,â Powell stated, reflecting the Fedâs reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fedâs exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRockâs exit and the collapse of NZAM BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRockâs departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. Corporations scale back climate pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability.

Title: Origin Materials, Inc. (ORGN) Stock: The Under-the-Radar Stock Poised for Massive Upside in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) stands against other under-the-radar stocks. Investing in under-the-radar stocks can be a savvy move for those looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially reap significant rewards. These lesser-known companies often fly under the radar of mainstream investors, which can result in undervalued stock prices. Under-the-radar stocks can be found in various sectors, from emerging technologies to niche industries, and are often characterized by their small market capitalization, limited analyst coverage, and low trading volumes. According to Business Insider, several lesser-known hedge funds have outperformed the market, Glen Kacher’s Light Street and David Rogers’ Castle Hook, for instance, returned 60% last year, outpacing many of their more prominent peers. Jason Mudrick’s firm also had a strong year, with returns of over 31%. Meanwhile, the largest hedge funds in the world, such as Citadel, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium, had good years, although most failed to match the S&P 500’s 23% gain. The impressive returns achieved by lesser-known hedge funds can be attributed to their bold investment strategies, which included a focus on under-the-radar stocks. By investing in these hidden gems, these funds were able to capitalize on undervalued opportunities and reap significant rewards. As a result, these under-the-radar stocks proved to be a key factor in the funds’ success.

In an interview with Bloomberg on January 18, David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, shared his outlook for US equities, forecasting an 11% upside for the S&P 500 index, based on the expectation that earnings per share will grow around 11% in calendar 2025 and 7% in calendar 2026. Kostin emphasized that equity investors are already looking ahead, with the fourth-quarter earnings season about to kick off, Kostin noted that earnings growth for the quarter is expected to be around 8%, but the strong dollar may lead to fewer positive surprises than in previous years. Kostin highlighted that the US stock market is trading at a high multiple, around 22-23 times forward earnings, which is historically high. As a result, earnings will be the primary driver of the market, rather than multiple expansion. He expects the S&P 500 index to rise to around 6,500, driven by earnings growth. Kostin also cautioned that a higher bond yield environment is a concern, as it has been a headwind for equities in the past. However, Kostin expects that inflation will come down slowly, and bond yields will fall to around 4.25% over the rest of the year. Kostin suggested that portfolio managers should focus on owning US companies with domestically driven revenues, rather than those with high export exposure. This is because companies with high domestic sales are less likely to be affected by retaliatory tariffs. Kostin also mentioned that the Magnificent Seven companies have significant sales outside the US, and may face potential risks due to their high export exposure. Kostin acknowledged that the Magnificent Seven companies have had fantastic stock performances in 2023 and 2024. However, he expects their premium earnings growth to narrow substantially in 2025 and 2026, leading to a narrowing excess return. As a result, Kostin favors mid-cap stocks, which trade at lower multiples and have similar growth rates to large-cap stocks. He believes that mid-cap US equities, with a market capitalization of between $5 billion to $20 billion, offer a better risk-reward profile. Lesser-known, under-the-radar companies are often overlooked by mainstream investors, but present a unique potential for growth, particularly in sectors poised for innovation and transformation.

To compile our list of the 10 under-the-radar stocks with massive upside for 2025, we sifted through internet rankings to find 30 under-the-radar stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of January 17. We also included their stock price as of January 17 and their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 38.89% Stock Price as of January 18: $1.08 Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 10 Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) is a leading sustainable materials company dedicated to proprietary technologies that enable the production of high-performance, cost-effective, and sustainable materials. The company’s primary focus is on the production of premium PET caps and closures, which are designed to be fully recyclable and circular. This technology is designed to address challenges in the packaging industry. Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) is aggressively scaling its CapFormer Systems to meet the growing demand for sustainable PET caps and closures. The company has successfully completed the Factory Acceptance Test of its initial CapFormer System, which demonstrated the system’s ability to produce fully functional PET caps with over 98% efficiency. This milestone is a critical step in the company’s plan to bring eight or more CapFormer Systems into production by the end of 2025. These systems are expected to produce between 8 billion and 12 billion caps annually. Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) is actively engaging with multiple potential customers, including several large beverage companies, whose total cap consumption is in excess of 100 billion caps per year. These customers are currently in the qualification phase, testing and qualifying the company’s caps for their own use. Once the qualification period is complete, Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) expects to sign definitive purchase agreements with these customers. The company is confident in its ability to sell every cap it can produce, driven by the strong demand from its prospective customers. Overall ORGN ranks 8th on our list of the under-the-radar stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of ORGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Netflix earnings preview: Sports to boost Q4 results as analysts debate future price hikes

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close. Analysts expect the streamer to deliver strong results after it ended the year with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson" boxing match, and the return of "Squid Game." Netflix stock has stumbled since the start of the year after finishing 2024 at record highs. The stock pullback comes as macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed broadly on megacap Big Tech. Here's what Wall Street expects for the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $10.11 billion (Netflix's guidance: $10.13 billion) versus $8.83 billion in Q4 2023 Earnings per share: $4.18 (Netflix's guidance: $4.23) versus $2.11 in Q4 2023 Net subscriber additions: 9.18 million versus 13.12 million in Q4 2023 "There are very high expectations going into this quarter," Geetha Ranganathan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. "But it's really the perfect setup for Netflix." Ranganathan called out the company's solid content slate, describing it as "one of their strongest quarters ever," as live sports programming dominated the platform. Notably, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day game ever in the US. "It's going to be really interesting to see how [sports] shapes the future of Netflix," Ranganathan said, adding the recent debut of WWE Raw will drive further growth and retention. "This is really the big shift we're going to see this quarter," she said. "That's going to drive subscriber momentum for Netflix in a big way. We're expecting well over 10 million subscriber additions." This will be the last earnings report in Netflix's history revealing net subscriber figures. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. Investors have recognized the company's efforts over the past year, which, in addition to a strong content slate, have included more advertising successes. According to its latest update, Netflix's ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users. The stock has surged about 80% year over year. It hit several all-time highs in 2024, as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company revealed in its latest biannual viewership report that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "We've been expecting a price increase in the US market for quite a while now," Ranganathan said. "They're definitely long overdue." The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience. Valuation has also been a concern, with analysts expecting a downward revision to the company's 2025 revenue outlook, due, in part, to the strengthening dollar. Currently, Netflix anticipates revenue growth between 11% and 13%, a slowdown from last year's 15% growth rate. "I think they'll temper those revenue growth projections," Ranganathan predicted. "But I think the way that they offset that is with a big price increase, which could happen anytime this year." Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Louis Bacon’s Top 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Billionaire Louis Bacon’s long-term stock picks. Louis Bacon is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers of his generation, known for his astute macroeconomic insights and ability to navigate volatile markets. As the founder of Moore Capital Management, Bacon built a reputation for delivering exceptional returns while maintaining a disciplined approach to risk management. Louis Moore Bacon was born in 1956 into a family with roots in business and the outdoors. His father, Louis Turner Bacon, was a businessman and chairman of the Reynolds Securities brokerage firm. These early influences shaped Bacon’s interest in finance and conservation. Bacon attended Middlebury College, where he earned a degree in American Literature, and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School, graduating in 1981. His education laid the groundwork for his successful career in trading and investment management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Bacon started his financial career on the trading desk of Bankers Trust. Later, he joined Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he developed expertise in trading currencies, commodities, and futures. His early experiences as a trader honed his ability to identify macroeconomic trends, a skill that would define his investment strategy. In 1987, Bacon used a $25,000 inheritance to establish his own trading account. His success during the stock market crash of October 1987, when he profited by shorting the market, demonstrated his ability to capitalize on turbulent conditions. In 1989, Louis Bacon founded Moore Capital Management with $25,000 of his own money and $1.6 million in seed capital. The hedge fund focused on global macroeconomic investing, a strategy that involves analyzing and trading based on macroeconomic trends such as interest rates, currencies, and commodities. Bacon’s success was rapid and significant. In its first year, Moore Capital posted a return of 86%, showcasing Bacon’s skill in navigating volatile markets. Over the decades, Moore Capital became one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry, managing more than $14 billion at its peak. Over three decades, Moore Capital delivered annualized returns of approximately 17%, outperforming most hedge funds. Bacon’s ability to generate profits during financial downturns, such as the 2008 global financial crisis, solidified his reputation as a skilled macro trader. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the 13F portfolio of the fund was worth more than $5.4 billion with the top holdings in the technology and financial sectors.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Moore Global Investments at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and internationally. It is one of the top long-term stock picks of Louis Bacon. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the fund owned 10,432 shares in the company, representing 0.17% of the portfolio. Bacon has trimmed this stake four times in the past five quarters, with one increase of nearly 80% compared to the previous filing at the beginning of last year. Moore Global Investments has been bullish on the company for many years. The hedge fund first bought a stake in the firm back in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, NOW ranks 10th on our list of Billionaire Louis Bacon’s long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Mega-Cap Stocks That Could Continue Surging Post 52-Week Highs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other mega-cap stocks. The US stock markets have gone up leading up to the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. All the major indices are set to continue their optimism from last week, when the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all reported gains of over 3.7%. Even though the S&P had hardly moved from its early November levels when the election happened, many mega-cap stocks continue to register 52-week highs. We looked at some of these stocks and why they are expected to continue surging up with the earnings season already underway. To come up with our list of 10 mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs, we only considered stocks that have recently hit their 52-week highs and have a market cap of at least $150 billion. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. JPMorgan Chase and Co. is a global financial services provider. It operates in asset & wealth management, consumer and community banking, and commercial & investment banking segments. The bank has shown a strong upward trend in the previous year with a gain of 55%. The reason for this optimism is the company’s recently announced Q4 performance. It exceeded the expected revenue for Q4 by $1.21 billion. Additionally, GAAP EPS was also higher ($4.81) than expected ($4.10). The Fixed-Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) trading Outperformed this quarter, clocking in at $5.01 billion, surpassing the expected $4.37 billion mark. The bank’s book value per share was up 11% while tangible book value per share was up 13% y/y. The net interest income of the bank was down 3% as compared to the previous year, but it still managed to exceed estimates. The strong performance of the company as well as continuous gain in the stock’s price for the whole year continues to deliver strong results for investors. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin Custody: Enabling Big Finance To Benefit From Bitcoin
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2025/01/20/bitcoin-custody-enabling-big-finance-to-benefit-from-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-20T20:39:11Z
Full Content:
Traditional finance will need advanced custody solutions to capitalize on bitcoin. Bitcoin has come a long way from the fringes of finance to its current status as a mainstream investment asset. The rise of bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) and ETFs has made it easier than ever for institutional investors to gain bitcoin exposure. However, as billions of dollars flow into these products, a significant issue has emerged that warrants closer scrutiny: reliance on single custodians to hold the physical bitcoin that backs them. Take the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock, for instance. With over $50 billion in assets under management as of this writing, it is by far the most successful bitcoin ETF in the market. Yet, every bitcoin held in that fund is held in custody solely by Coinbase. BlackRock is a titan of finance, but the reality is that Coinbase – in addition to BlackRock – is a key source of counterparty risk for investors. This single point of failure exposes the fund to a risk of catastrophic loss about which few investors are likely to be aware. The potential fallout of this arrangement is clearly spelled out in the iShares Bitcoin Trust’s SEC registration statement: "...in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the Bitcoin Custodian... customers’ assets – including the Trust’s assets – may be considered the property of the Bitcoin Custodian, and customers – including the Trust – may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets." In simpler terms, if Coinbase were to declare bankruptcy, holders of iShares Bitcoin ETF units could find themselves at the back of the line, treated as unsecured creditors with no guaranteed claim to the bitcoin backing their shares. Coinbase’s credit rating of BB– from S&P Global Ratings places it in "junk" status. That’s right – the company that is trusted with holding the physical bitcoin worth billions of dollars, has a less than stellar credit rating. As of this writing, there is no reason to question Coinbase’s ability to continue holding bitcoin in custody on behalf of its clients. But, before we dismiss this scenario as unlikely, remember that bitcoin history is littered with examples of custodian collapses – from Mt. Gox, to FTX, to Prime Trust. Single-custodian models are a holdover from traditional finance, where assets are often pooled with a single clearinghouse or bank. However, bitcoin is fundamentally different. It doesn’t require a centralized custodian, so relying on one undermines the very principles that make bitcoin valuable: trust minimization and resilience against centralized points of failure. The failure of a single custodian can happen for various reasons. Beyond bankruptcy and fraud, there’s the risk of state attacks, cyberattacks, and operational failures. Any of these events could render the assets inaccessible, even if the bitcoin itself is still visible on the blockchain. In a market that values speed, security, and autonomy, many institutional investors consider this an unacceptable risk. This is the problem solved by multi-institutional custody (MIC). MIC uses bitcoin’s native multi-signature technology to distribute custody across multiple independent institutions in different jurisdictions. Instead of one institution holding all the keys in a multi-signature quorum, MIC distributes them across several regulated custodians. This means that no single custodian can authorize transactions on its own, because a quorum of keys (for example, 2 out of 3) is required to move funds. Even if one custodian goes bankrupt or is compromised, the depositor’s bitcoin remains secure and accessible. By combining custodians in different countries with independent regulatory regimes, MIC minimizes risk of coordinated asset freezes or seizures. This distributed approach mitigates many, but not all, of the risks associated with bitcoin custodians, and is a more robust custody solution for institutional-scale investments than the solutions used most often today. The demand for secure, scalable bitcoin custody has never been higher. As ETFs, ETPs, corporate treasuries, and strategic reserves gain momentum, institutional investors will need solutions that address the risks posed by single custodians. Bitcoin service providers such as Onramp offer a multi-institution custody framework that integrates the best elements of traditional security protocols with the resilience of bitcoin’s decentralized architecture. The benefits of MIC extend beyond just security. By involving multiple custodians, institutions diversify their exposure, reducing the risk of catastrophic loss due to a single point of failure. Multi-sig setups provide cryptographic proof of reserves and require multiple parties to approve transactions, increasing oversight and accountability. Institutions can customize their custody arrangements to suit governance and compliance requirements, with the ability to add or rotate custodians as needed. One reason that trust structures are gaining traction again is that they can utilize MIC while offering tax-efficiency. Unlike ETFs, which generally require cash settlements, trusts can facilitate in-kind delivery, meaning investors can receive the underlying bitcoin itself rather than fiat cash. This eliminates a taxable event and preserves the long-term upside of holding bitcoin directly. For pension funds, endowments, and family offices seeking direct exposure to bitcoin without introducing additional counterparty risk, MIC-enabled trusts present a compelling alternative. By combining the ease of traditional financial products with the security of decentralized custody, these structures offer institutions a more efficient and resilient way to gain bitcoin exposure. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs was a milestone for the industry, but as the market matures, the limitations of single-custodian models are becoming harder to ignore. Just as traditional finance developed multi-custodian clearinghouses and diversified asset management frameworks, new bitcoin financial products will need to be created to meet the needs of increasing numbers of institutional investors.

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) It's just a jump to the left … and then a step to the right. Even before Donald Trump's inauguration, some of America's biggest corporations had decided to get in line with the new administration's version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show's Time Warp, a dance now playing out across the globe. The new president's views on everything from diversity and workplace inclusion to his opposition to policies on climate change not long ago would have sparked a backlash from many in corporate America. Instead, there's been an about face from major American companies, a shift that already has filtered through to Australia. US President Donald Trump's first days into his second term live updates: Follow with our blog US President Donald Trump's first days into his second term live updates: Follow with our blog Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg may be the poster child for the sudden U-turn. He's rid Facebook of fact checkers because of bias, an argument that instead suggests he needs better fact checkers. More recently, he's complained that workplaces need more "masculine energy". But Trump's resounding win in the US election has emboldened politicians elsewhere, including Australia, to step back on "progressive" policies and boardrooms across the developed world are taking pre-emptive action. Donald Trump's re-election was a revolt against economic policies that have left millions disenfranchised and uncertain about their place in the world. But Americans should be wary of his policies pushing inflation and debt even higher. How far leaders, both political and corporate, can afford to switch stance has its limits. Politicians need to win elections so winding back the gains women and minority groups have made in the workplace could quickly backfire at the polling booth down the track. Similarly, corporate leaders need to maximise profits if they want to keep their jobs. Most have embraced strategies around climate change not simply because the science is undeniable but because there's money to be made. Even worse, ignoring it comes at significant long-term cost, particularly if you're in an industry like insurance. Even at this early stage, there are jarring inconsistencies in the new approach. For the moment, though, almost any criticism can be dismissed by simply declaring it as "woke". Trump's second presidency has already emboldened boardrooms to take a step back on "progressive" policies. (Reuters: Andrew Kelly) For the past few years each December, Macquarie Bank published its achievements in winding back its exposures to carbon intensive industries. That was until last month, when the annual update failed to materialise and financiers globally sniffed the wind and opted to quietly pull back. Spooked by threats of legal action because the environmental aims put them at risk of ignoring their responsibility to maximise investor returns, some of the globe's biggest money managers have quietly pulled back on pledges made in the wake of the Glasgow COP21 meeting. A little over a fortnight ago, BlackRock — a titan of global finance and investment — pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collection of more than 300 major investment groups managing assets worth almost $US60 trillion ($97 trillion). In Australia, our woeful productivity lately is a source of puzzled discontent and finger-pointing, especially when compared with the United States. But the dark side has been made clear. That sent shivers through the industry and put money managers into a mild state of panic. Three days later, the organisation suddenly suspended itself and its activities and solemnly pledged that, rather than toiling to reduce emissions, it would keep its remaining members' identities secret. The reason? The incoming Trump administration. "Recent developments in the US and different regulatory and client expectations in investors' respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context," it said. Among the members were a tribe of Australian outfits, including IFM Investors — the Industry Super collective that now ranks as one of the world's biggest infrastructure investors — Macquarie and Magellan. Until now, financiers have argued that climate change is an investment issue and that they don't want to be caught lending to or investing in stranded assets and that it is prudent to wind back exposure. Latching on to the new mood, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton recently lashed out at "woke bankers" and threatened to impose a new regime that would pressure banks to lend to creditworthy companies extracting fossil fuels or forestry. Some of the world's biggest money managers have distanced themselves from past Net Zero pledges. (Reuters: Jason Lee) The evolution of ESG, environment, social and governance, has been long and slow and taken place under governments of all persuasions. Since the turn of the century, investors have demanded public companies that are accountable, open to scrutiny and conform to the tighter regulation around environmental controls and labour laws. Similarly, the push towards Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within corporations has grown as laws have tightened to stamp out discrimination on gender, race and sexuality. That's emboldened senior executives of public companies to make statements that have been construed as meddling in politics. WiseTech is not the only publicly-listed company to face allegations of bad behaviour. What's the role of boards? Debate over The Voice referendum and the Same Sex Marriage plebiscite, when high profile executives from Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank weighed in, enraged some Coalition politicians including Mr Dutton who made it plain that he believed company executives should stick to providing better customer service. Having spent so much time and energy improving their workplace cultures, and with bonuses tied to implementing these programs, the bosses of our biggest companies have been actively spruiking their progress as a means of attracting top staff. Harassment within firms, sexual or otherwise, comes with a hefty price tag, with lawyers, penalties and smeared reputations. Winding back the diversity programs would need to first involve softening the law, a prospect that could backfire politically down the track. Donald Trump's message to corporate America left no margin for misunderstanding. In addition to targeting any firm with offshore plants, from now on the focus would be on hiring the best instead of trying to elevate workers on factors like diversity, equity and inclusion. America is to return to a meritocracy with gender or race playing no part. That philosophy, however, seems to jar with the ideals laid out under Project 2025 where the clear goal is only to hire Trump loyalists into the administration and much of the public service, a policy that takes "political correctness" into a new realm. There are similar contradictions on climate policy as well. During his last stint in the White House, the president withdrew America from the Paris climate commitments, and he has since championed the cause for fossil fuels with his "Drill Baby Drill" catchcry. But his seemingly outlandish plan to buy Greenland heavily revolves around climate change. US president-elect Donald Trump refuses to rule out using the military to seize control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. From a security and strategic viewpoint, the strip of ocean between Greenland and the UK has become a less hostile route for shipping as the polar cap melts, allowing Russian and Chinese ships easier access to North America. Then there are the economic attractions. The island has extraordinary amounts of natural resources. Not only is Greenland rich in oil, it also has boundless quantities of critical minerals, particularly rare earths which are vital for not only weapons production but for the technology required to produce renewable energy and electric vehicles. With a terrain once considered too harsh for wide-scale exploitation, climate change has made these minerals more accessible as the ice covering 80 per cent of the island thins. It also makes them more valuable. Donald Trump and consistency rarely appear in the same sentence, but his push to unwind diversity provisions in the workplace and environmental rules has struck a powerful chord amongst those who believe they have been left behind or unfairly overlooked. Corporate America appears to be falling in behind Trump for now. Scaling back workplace legal protections and environmental laws may prove to be a tougher task.

We recently published a list of Billionaire Joseph Edelman's Top 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Immatics N.V. (NASDAQ:IMTX) stands against other Billionaire Joseph Edelman’s long-term stock picks. Joseph Edelman is a renowned figure in the investment world, recognized for his expertise in biotechnology and healthcare investing. As the founder, CEO, and portfolio manager of Perceptive Advisors, Edelman has built a reputation as one of the most successful and insightful investors in the biotech sector. His deep understanding of the scientific, clinical, and financial aspects of the industry has enabled him to identify promising companies and generate significant returns for his investors. Joseph Edelman earned his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of California, San Diego, and later pursued an MBA from NYU Stern School of Business. He began his career as a biotechnology analyst at Prudential Securities and subsequently worked as a portfolio manager at Paramount Capital Asset Management. These early roles provided Edelman with a foundation in analyzing biotech companies, understanding their value drivers, and assessing the risks associated with drug development and regulatory approval processes.

In 1999, Edelman founded Perceptive Advisors, a New York-based investment firm focused on the life sciences sector.

Perceptive Advisors specializes in identifying high-growth potential in emerging biotech, pharmaceutical, and healthcare companies, with an emphasis on innovation in areas such as gene therapy, oncology, and rare diseases. Under Edelman’s leadership, Perceptive Advisors has achieved remarkable success. The firm manages over $4.7 billion in the 13F portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Perceptive Life Sciences Fund has delivered annualized returns exceeding 15% over the past two decades, far outpacing broader market indices. Edelman has been an early backer of biotech companies that went on to achieve significant breakthroughs, including Moderna and CRISPR Therapeutics. While Edelman’s track record is stellar, the biotech sector’s inherent risks mean that not all investments succeed. Regulatory setbacks, clinical trial failures, and market sentiment can lead to significant volatility.

Title: Scotiabank Joins Wall Street-Led Exit of Bankers’ Climate Club

(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Nova Scotia is the latest major bank to walk away from the industry’s biggest climate-finance alliance, following a mass exodus led by Wall Street. The lender confirmed Monday it left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, news that comes after Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada all said Friday they were leaving the NZBA. Scotiabank and other lenders that quit the group all said the decision won’t affect their commitment to decarbonizing their business. In Scotiabank’s case, the firm “will continue to finance the transition and support our clients in implementing their sustainability strategies — this is the most important role that we can play,” spokesperson Katie Raskina said by email, adding that the bank “will continue to report on our progress, while meeting the varied and growing requirements of regulators across the globe.” Royal Bank of Canada is the only large Canadian bank remaining in the alliance, but the country’s biggest lender has suggested it’s reconsidering that membership. Dave McKay, RBC’s chief executive officer, said in early January that pulling out of the NZBA “doesn’t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.” A representative for RBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on the status of its membership in the group. Canadian banks were some of the biggest financiers to oil, gas and coal companies in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, RBC, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan Chase & Co. Since the beginning of December, the NZBA has been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan. The moves come as US President Donald Trump makes clear he’ll seek to roll back Biden-era climate policies and instead promote a revival of fossil-fuel production. Trump’s return has also emboldened the Republican Party in its ongoing attacks on climate finance, as states double down on bans and lawsuits. Other climate alliances have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among the asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying in NZAM had exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net-zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid Republican litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100 , was hit by high-profile defections last year by the asset-management arms of Goldman, JPMorgan and Pacific Investment Management Co.

We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Lee Cooperman's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) stands against Lee Cooperman's other long-term stock picks. Leon Cooperman is a highly respected figure in the investment world, known for his acumen, philanthropy, and candid commentary on markets and economics. As the founder of Omega Advisors, Cooperman built a reputation as one of Wall Street’s most successful hedge fund managers. Leon Cooperman was born in New York in 1943 to working-class immigrant parents. His father was a plumber, and his mother was a homemaker. Cooperman earned his undergraduate degree from Hunter College in 1964 and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School. Cooperman began his professional journey at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 25 years. He joined the firm as an analyst and rose through the ranks to lead the Asset Management division. His tenure at Goldman Sachs was marked by significant achievements, including his role in expanding the firm's institutional investment management services. In 1991, Cooperman left Goldman Sachs to establish Omega Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in value-oriented investing. He built the firm on principles of thorough research, disciplined risk management, and a long-term investment horizon. Under his leadership, Omega Advisors delivered strong returns, earning a reputation as one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. At its height, Omega Advisors managed approximately $10 billion in assets, attracting institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. In 2018, when Cooperman transitioned the firm into a family office, Omega Advisors had around $3.6 billion in AUM. Over its 27 years as a hedge fund, Omega Advisors achieved annualized returns of approximately 12%, outperforming many of its peers and major indices during key periods. During bullish market cycles, Cooperman’s ability to identify undervalued stocks enabled the fund to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500, which has an average historical return of around 10% annually. For instance, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cooperman’s investments in financials, industrials, and energy sectors delivered double-digit gains.

(NASDAQ:COOP) is the consumer brand for mortgage servicing and the origination operation of Mr. Cooper Group. The first thing that makes the company worth investing in is its commendable growth despite the rising interest rates. According to the report of the third quarter of 2024, the reported net income was $80 million, including another mark-to-market of $126 million, equivalent to ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) of 6.9% and operating ROTCE (Return on Tangible Common Equity) of 16.8%. Moreover, its servicing portfolio grew 32% year-on-year to $1,239 billion. Secondly, the company has completely acquired Flagstar’s Mortgage Operations, which shows the company’s ability to deliver full-service solutions to financial institutions and clients by the beginning of 2025. Lastly, the company is committed to integrating AI and machine learning in the mortgage industry to deliver top-notch services. For instance, the development of Pyro AI exemplifies this and underscores the focus on a digital-first strategy to drive future growth.

Title: Ethereum Market Takeover: Expert Predicts Surge To $14,000 In Six Months

In a thread on X today, January 20, Dennis Liu (@VirtualBacon0x), a general partner at Momentum 6, laid out a bold forecast for Ethereum (ETH), suggesting the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reach a price target of $14,000 by the end of 2025. Liu also contends that the next six months will be pivotal, highlighting ETH’s potential to “dominate the market” through June. “Ethereum is about to dominate the market, you don’t want to miss this window,” Liu wrote. “Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin this cycle, but that’s about to change. I believe ETH will shine in the next 6 months.” Despite ETH’s growing adoption, Liu argues that its underperformance relative to Bitcoin stems from “institutional timing.” According to him: “ETH is institutionally driven, unlike Bitcoin or retail-favored altcoins. ETFs provide stability and utility, making ETH ideal for institutional investors.” Liu suggests institutions have been waiting for market conditions to improve and sees 2025 as the year when these conditions finally align. Liu also points to the US Federal Reserve’s policy shifts as a catalyst for ETH’s growth. He notes that since May 2024, the Fed has been slowing its balance sheet reductions, and a possible pivot toward renewed liquidity injections could occur after the January 29 or March 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Since May 2024, the Fed has slowed balance sheet reductions, signaling a pivot. A liquidity boost could follow Jan 29 or Mar 19 FOMC meetings. Why it matters: Fed liquidity pumps historically drive ETH/BTC higher.” He concludes that such a move by the Fed “means ETH outperformance” could be on the horizon. Citing a decade of market data, Liu claims ETH typically outperforms Bitcoin from January to June, while Bitcoin tends to lead from July to December. “From January to June, ETH consistently outperforms Bitcoin. … If you’re holding ETH, now until June is historically the best window for gains.” Liu also highlights potential pro-ETH sentiments from the Trump administration, referencing the former president’s NFT collections and DeFi platform built on Ethereum: “His NFT collections and DeFi platform are built on Ethereum. Trump’s administration plans to replace SEC leadership, revisiting anti-DeFi rulings. Institutional optimism surged after Trump’s election win in Nov 2024, driving ETF inflows.” He concludes that “pro-crypto policies will directly benefit Ethereum-focused DeFi.” Further emphasizing Ethereum’s institutional strength, Liu points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives by major firms like BlackRock and prominent DeFi platforms such as AAVE, MakerDAO, and OriginTrail: “Ethereum isn’t leading meme coin or AI trends – it’s powering serious institutional growth.” Liu underscores a notable shift in Ethereum ETF inflows, which turned positive in November 2024 after a period of outflows: “ETFs added $6B in net inflows from Nov to Jan, or 0.76% of ETH supply/month. … Institutions are buying more ETH than BTC monthly, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum as an asset.” Projecting out to 2025, Liu believes ETH could quadruple to $14,000 if Bitcoin doubles to $200,000, citing Ethereum’s historical tendency to outperform Bitcoin by an additional factor of two: “If Bitcoin doubles to $200K, ETH could 4x to $14K, following its historical outperformance (2x on top of BTC). … While diminishing returns may limit upside, ETH remains a high-conviction bet for this cycle.” Summarizing his perspective, Liu stresses that a confluence of factors—from renewed Fed liquidity to potential pro-DeFi policies—creates a near-term window of opportunity for Ethereum: “With ETF inflows rising, the Fed’s potential liquidity injection, Trump’s pro-DeFi stance, and ETH’s seasonal strength, all the catalysts are aligned. … Ethereum’s time to shine is now until June. I’d rather be overexposed than miss this opportunity.” At press time, ETH traded at $106,929. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Can The Washington Post save itself?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Staffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus The Washington Post is one of the most storied organizations in American journalism. But it is in crisis, losing reporting talent, suffering a loss of readers and facing a staff rebellion against publisher Will Lewis. The Post has been swamped by "one debacle after another," since Lewis took charge of the newspaper a year ago, said NPR. The decision by the owner (and billionaire Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos to cancel the Post's traditional presidential endorsement in an apparent effort to placate newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump was a huge blow, causing "hundreds of thousands of subscribers" to cancel their subscriptions. Layoffs have led to fewer journalists on the job, contributing to plummeting morale that led some of the survivors to flee for jobs elsewhere. A "clear vision" to put the Post back on track to journalistic and financial success remains "elusive," said NPR. More than 400 Post staffers last week sent a letter to Bezos asking him to "get personally involved to turn the paper back in the right direction," said Poynter. The staffers said in the letter they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions" that caused readers to bolt. They asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bezos in the service of "restoring trust that has been lost." Bezos did not immediately reply. Escape your echo chamber.

Bezos has "plunged my beloved Washington Post into darkness," said Eleanor Clift at The Daily Beast. Post reporters have done a "first-rate job covering Trump," but Bezos' decision to pacify the incoming president (with the non-endorsement, as well Amazon's $40 million expense on a documentary about Melania Trump) has raised the specter their journalism could be "compromised by anything that could damage Bezos' financial interests." Bezos' decision to get on Trump's good side "has ramifications far beyond the Post newsroom." If the Post is to remain viable, it must "retain, not lose, its talent," Margaret Sullivan said at The Guardian. It's not "unreasonable to question" whether the Post can maintain its independence in the Trump era, and "Bezos may not care." But if he does care, he should "show up — soon" in the newsroom to talk to reporters, and recommit to the "importance of editorial freedom." He should also dump Lewis, who has overseen a rapid decline in the Post's standing. For the sake of both journalism and "democracy itself, I sure hope he finds a way to do it." On the eve of Trump's inauguration, the Post unveiled a new mission statement: "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The slogan is intended as an "internal rallying point for employees," said The New York Times. And the paper's chief strategy officer has announced a goal of reaching 200 million paying users. That's an audacious target: The Post currently has fewer than 3 million digital subscribers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Lee Cooperman's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ABR) stands against Lee Cooperman's other long-term stock picks. Leon Cooperman is a highly respected figure in the investment world, known for his acumen, philanthropy, and candid commentary on markets and economics. As the founder of Omega Advisors, Cooperman built a reputation as one of Wall Street’s most successful hedge fund managers. Leon Cooperman was born in New York in 1943 to working-class immigrant parents. His father was a plumber, and his mother was a homemaker. Cooperman earned his undergraduate degree from Hunter College in 1964 and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School. Cooperman began his professional journey at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 25 years. He joined the firm as an analyst and rose through the ranks to lead the Asset Management division. His tenure at Goldman Sachs was marked by significant achievements, including his role in expanding the firm's institutional investment management services. In 1991, Cooperman left Goldman Sachs to establish Omega Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in value-oriented investing. He built the firm on principles of thorough research, disciplined risk management, and a long-term investment horizon. Under his leadership, Omega Advisors delivered strong returns, earning a reputation as one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry.

At its height, Omega Advisors managed approximately $10 billion in assets, attracting institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. In 2018, when Cooperman transitioned the firm into a family office, Omega Advisors had around $3.6 billion in AUM. Over its 27 years as a hedge fund, Omega Advisors achieved annualized returns of approximately 12%, outperforming many of its peers and major indices during key periods. During bullish market cycles, Cooperman’s ability to identify undervalued stocks enabled the fund to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500, which has an average historical return of around 10% annually. For instance, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cooperman’s investments in financials, industrials, and energy sectors delivered double-digit gains.

Title: Content Americas 2025: The Confab’s No. 1 Question, a Movie Renaissance, What Buyers Want, Brazil and Deals to Date
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/content-americas-key-themes-and-major-takeaways-1236279425/

By John Hopewell Chief International Correspondent MIAMI — The best thing about the Miami Hilton Downtown is its vistas from above Biscayne Bay and opposite the city’s iconic serried strip of high-rises. Delegates at Content Americas, which begins its third edition this Monday, will be hoping that the market will afford an equally panoramic view of the international TV business. That’s crucial. Few areas of the world became so dependent on global platform investment as Latin America during the pandemic. Bucking worldwide trends, series season orders actually soared in Spain over 2024, shooting up from 43 a year earlier to 75, according to Ampere Analysis. “Content Americas is the first TV event of the year and, therefore, an opportunity to test, by talking to folks, your incoming hypotheses about how market trends will play out,” says Gaumont USA’s Christian Gabela. Related Stories VIP+ Why Letterboxd Became the Go-To Platform for Online Film Buffs Blake Lively's Lawyers Say Justin Baldoni Legal Battle Is 'Not a Feud' Over 'It Ends With Us' Creative Differences, Criticize 'More Attacks' From Baldoni's Team As of Sunday, participation sits at just short of 2,000 delegates and 175 exhibitors, edging up from compared to 2024. Popular on Variety That slight increase reflects the fact that, when it comes to Latin America, most all players have attended from last, with Content Americas serving as both a market and production meet, connecting major players from Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic and Spain. Some urgent, specific questions need answering. One case in point: After across-the-board top exec layoffs and departures, effective from December, how will Televisa-Univisión streaming service ViX handle acquisitions? The big question delegates hope Content Americas will address echoes across the world: After a severe corrective in 2023, will global TV streamers in any way be back in the saddle driving growth in Latin America? Don’t Expect Easy Answers Content Americas attendees shouldn’t expect easy answers. “Global streamers are still in different phases — some are consolidating, some are driving toward profitability, and some are business as usual. It’s hard to know what the next year will look like. This unpredictability represents a challenging time for producers,” says Erik Barmack at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. Sales cycles have slowed dramatically after the launch of original production across the region, from Netflix’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 to Paramount+ and HBO Max service bows in 2021. 2024: As Bad As It Gets? There is a dire need for visibility, however. Some stats set to be fired off at Content Americas will make for startling viewing. In 2022, major global streamers – Netflix, Amazon, Apple, WBD, Disney, Comcast and Paramount – made 69 season orders in Brazil. By 2024, that figure was down to 28. Mexico’s 49 commissions in 2022 plunged 27% to 36 in 2024. Given global streamers have been the fundamental industry driver of recent years – and lifeboat in 2020 – their corrective plays out over the whole industry. One-year results, however, can be hugely misleading. In some countries, such as Brazil with Globo, incumbents are still highly important. One bottom line is that buoyed by ad tiers, SVOD players will continue to grow their subscription bases in Latin America, Netflix from 51 million in 2024 to 69.5 million in 2029, Omdia predicts. Some established players, such as NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, look bullish on production growth. Its chairman, Luis Fernández, will deliver one of the most awaited keynotes at this year’s Content Americas. “At a time when Telemundo is the most-watched network in prime time, we are super-charging our scripted content production under one strong brand: Telemundo Studios,” Fernández told Variety last April. A Stabler Market The bottom line, per industry consensus, however, is that far fewer originals will be produced in Latin America in the future compared to the explosion of orders in the recent past. Producers hope, at least, that the market will settle. “2024 was clearly a year where streamers’ budgets for “originals” became increasingly under pressure,” says Gabela. “Our hope is that there’s greater stability in that regard in 2025.” Ringing the Changes “Stabler” is another way of suggesting that, of course, money will be tight throughout the industry. So the story of 2025’s Content Americas may well be producers’ and distributors’ reactions to that. “Independents need to be creative now about financing plans that incorporate multiple territories, to be clever about understanding public funds and the general ecosystems in particular markets,” says Barmack. There are some more obvious ways forward that are already on the radar. “Last year, as streamers cut back on commissioning projects, co-production and windowing became the talk of the town. In 2025, I think we’ll see more of those conversations materialize into deals as the industry readjusts,” says Gabela. “Fewer originals means the need for more co-productions and invites us to be creative to find the financing,” agrees EO Media’s Eze Olzanski. Movies: A TV Industry Future At least in the English-speaking world, there’s a kind of rebound in films from A24, Blumhouse, and Neon with “Longlegs” and “Terrifier,” for example, auteur genre films with talent cast against type. “[Creative] talent can make the difference and become a part of the business equation, and the payoff can be really, really high,” says Fremantle’s Manuel Martí. Gaumont USA, with Pasajero, has produced Netflix’s “The Biggest Fan” with Kate del Castillo as it sets up remakes of its classic film catalog at platforms. The Mediapro Studio has scored one of its most significant hits in 2024 with “El 47,” the frontrunner at February’s Spanish Academy Goya Awards. “I think the sector’s going back in some ways to what it was before,” Olzanski tells Variety, noting that global streamer production is ever more ‘local for local,’ though local may be one territory and fewer projects will be for all Latin America or aim for global.” Selectivity Volume for volume’s sake is a waning philosophy: “Independents need to be pickier, frankly, about projects. Not all of this pullback is bad — it’s forcing higher standards that the industry could use,” Barmack observes. Olzanski agrees. “The industry is finding its new balance, understanding its current size, how much it can produce and sell, and working for that size. It’s a moment of honesty for the industry.” “Reducing the number of productions and releases, particularly releases, might seem a bad thing, but on the positive side, gives more visibility and value to launches,” he adds. What Will Buyers Be Buying? There was a time – broadly last decade – when experiments ran wild at pay-TV operators and an early Netflix. From the turn of this decade broadly, a pivot occurred: “Creators are working with known genres and frameworks and then trying to reinvent them,” Berlinale Series head Julia Fidel noted in 2022. Now, “series are genre layering, layering one genre on top of another,” said Fremantle’s Manuel Marti. One part political exposé, another part espionage thriller, “Yosi, The Regretful Spy,” whose Season 2 competes for a Rose d’Or Latino, is one case in point. Another contender, the Natalia Beristáin showrun “Midnight Family,” from Fremantle and Fabula, melds a reality-sourced medical thriller and family drama. Series, Martí points out, will remain plot-driven, “making you want to see the whole season,” and character-driven, “making you come again for the second season.” Character-driven drama is, moreover, on the rise. “I guess at the Emmys, both ‘Shogun’ and ‘The Bear’ were character-driven, which is what people especially crave,” Martí observes. More Buyer Interests Beyond that, “Regular, returnable and franchiseable content will be the most attractive,” says Ampere’s Fred Black. “Particularly crime dramas, which work globally and are produced internationally.” On distribution, apart from the more relevant new launches, buyers are moving ever more into non-exclusive deals, says Olzanski. On the local side, “we’ve gone back to a more normal thing with the usual slots for television: Action, natural disasters, a family, kids, co-viewing, and so on,” he adds. The production of fewer originals doesn’t mean that streamers will be acquiring more, he cautioned, “and that is part of finding the new balance.” Brazil “Thanks to the global presence of the streamers, Brazilian producers’ content has been watched outside the country, which was great for them, and now they want more. Being in such a huge market, having success abroad is a newly acquired desire, not necessarily a need,” says Martí. Also, he notes that global streamers look set to be obliged to invest a percentage of gross revenues in Brazilian content. Content Americas 2025 takes place, also, as “I’m Still Here” scored a best actress award for Fernanda Torres and “Senna,” praised for its production values, has played in Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English TV charts. It’s a special moment for the international industry to see Brazil as a key production center,” says Luis Toledo, the former highly active Spcine exec, who is launching Filomena Productions to connect Brazil, Latin America and the global South with established international markets. “This is exactly the reason for creating Filomena. To “prove” or guarantee to the more developed film markets that the global South can deliver the same quality but with lower prices and also new stories/narratives. The world can’t stand watching ‘Fast and Furious’ number 156 anymore.” Deals to Date *El Estudio, partnering with L.A.-based Happy Accidents, has acquired adaptation rights to ”Here Come the Habibs,” a fish-out-of-water Australian comedy about a Lebanese family. The adaptation will be set in Mexico City. *Pablo and Juan de Dios Larraín’s Fabula and BBC Studios-backed Spanish shingle Brutal Media are set to co-produce “Los crímenes del Glaciar,” a Patagonia-set triller adapting Cristian Perfumo’s novel.

A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingers Willsey et al. A man with paralysis who had electrodes implanted in his brain can pilot a virtual drone through an obstacle course simply by imagining moving his fingers. His brain signals are interpreted by an AI model and then used to control a simulated drone. Brain-computer interface (BCI) research has made huge strides in recent years, allowing people with paralysis to precisely control a mouse cursor and dictate speech to computers by imagining writing words with a pen. But so far, they haven’t yet shown great promise in complex applications with multiple inputs. Read moreMind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Read more Mind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Advertisement Now, Matthew Willsey at the University of Michigan and his colleagues have created an algorithm that allows a user to trigger four discrete signals by imagining moving their fingers and thumb. The anonymous man who tried the technology has tetraplegia due to a spinal cord injury. He had already been fitted with a BCI from Blackrock Neurotech made up of 192 electrodes, implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the complex neural signals received by the electrodes to the user’s thoughts. The participant learned how to think of the first two fingers of one hand moving, creating an electrical signal that can be made stronger or weaker. Another signal was generated by the second two fingers and another two by the thumb. The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. These were sufficient to allow the user to control a virtual drone by thought alone, and with practice he could skilfully pilot it through an obstacle course. Willsey says the experiment could have been done using a real drone, but was kept virtual for ease and safety. “The goal of doing the quadcopter was really kind of shared between our lab and the participant,” says Willsey. “For him, it was the realisation of kind of a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled; he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” Although the results are impressive, there is still much to be done before BCIs can be reliably used for complex tasks, says Willsey. Firstly, AI is needed to interpret signals from the electrodes, and this relies on individual training for every user. Secondly, this training needs to be repeated over time as functionality declines, which may be due to electrodes shifting slightly in the brain or changes in the brain itself.

Title: Netflix’s Expected Q4 Subscriber Bonanza Should Get Earnings Season Off To A Fast Start

By Dade Hayes Business Editor As is the case with most Netflix earnings reports, the question for the company on Tuesday isn’t whether the number of subscribers will rise – it’s about just how high the number can go. Most Wall Street analysts expect a marked surge in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, driven by the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight, two NFL games and series premieres like Squid Game‘s second season. The report by Netflix, coming on the first full day of President Donald Trump’s second term, will kick off a five-week period of fresh media and tech financial results. The numbers and executive comments, a burst after the annual holiday lull, will offer the first signals about the trajectory of 2025. Related Stories News Ted Sarandos On The Prospect Of Full Season, Big League Sports On Netflix News 'Narnia' Imax Release Not A Change To Netflix's Theatrical Strategy, Ted Sarandos Says Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp. are expected to weigh in on their failed joint streaming venture, Venu Sports, and Comcast will brief Wall Street on progress with NBCUniversal cable network spinoff it announced last November, and Paramount Global will offer updates on the company’s pending merger with Skydance Media. Big Tech leaders will also make their voices heard after flocking to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. Watch on Deadline Netflix is expected to add 8.2 million subscribers in the quarter, reaching 290.9 million, according to the consensus forecast by Wall Street analysts. Given the company’s momentum surging at the end of December, estimates are undergoing upward revision. A survey of 45 buy-side analysts conducted by Guggenheim Securities found that 70% of them are calling for at least 11.1 million net adds in the quarter, and 29% are now north of 13.1 million. This is the last quarter when the streaming leader plans to report subscriber numbers, shifting its emphasis to revenue and operating margin, along with audience metrics like engagement. Tim Nollen of Macquarie believes the timing of the subscriber disclosure end is not accidental. “It is possible subscription growth will slow from here as paid sharing enforcement has largely cycled through,” he wrote in a note to clients, “but a slowing rate of sub growth does not necessarily mean slower growth for the company overall.” Nollen sees the company adding more than 10 million subscribers in the quarter, with “a decent chance” the tally ends up even higher, one reason he upped his 12-month price target on Netflix shares to $965, from $795. Alicia Reese of Wedbush Securities sees the company’s 2-year-old advertising business becoming a primary driver of revenue by 2026. In a recent research note, she maintained her “outperform” rating on Netflix stock at a 12-month target of $950. “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars,” she wrote. “Netflix can retain its moat while competitors try to replicate its business model. … With global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability, Netflix has reached the right formula.” Among the questions Netflix will like face during its self-mediated earnings call (in which its head of investor relations selects and groups analyst queries as opposed to an open conference-call format) concern price hikes, advertising growth and the strategy for live sports. The streaming giant announced just before Christmas that it acquired rights to multiple editions of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, adding to the multi-year NFL relationship launched in 2024. Sports-adjacent WWE Raw also began weekly live airings earlier this month under a multi-year rights deal, adding a potent draw to the ad tier, which is where Netflix is focusing its energy. Disney is executing a similar streaming strategy. With its portfolio finally profitable five years after the launch of flagship Disney+, the company is pushing more customers toward the cheaper, ad-supported option. It also mimicked Netflix’s effort to force anyone sharing passwords to pay for the privilege. Like its media peers, Disney faces a number of other challenges. The L.A. wildfires, which got the year off to a catastrophic start, especially for many entertainment industry workers, will factor into the company’s earnings report even though they broke out after the quarter’s end. In a recent note to clients reaffirming her “buy” rating on Disney but raising some concerns, BofA Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote that it “does not appear the recent LA fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance.” Even so, she sees “potential risk” to forecasts for incremental costs due to the need for temporary employee housing and business disruption. The quarter ending 2024, which is officially the first quarter of Disney’s fiscal year, which began last fall, “will be the trough quarter of this fiscal year” for the company’s Experiences division, Ehrlich predicts. The impact of two recent hurricanes, along with cruise ship pre-opening costs, will weigh on results. And then there is Venu, which was scrapped before ever launching. Announced with fanfare in February 2024 by JV partners Disney, Fox and WBD, it was sued on antitrust grounds by pay-TV provider Fubo. As part of a settlement reached this month, Disney said it would acquire 70% of Fubo. All three partners are likely to be asked to quantify their investment in Venu. During the trial, it was revealed that the tab had exceeded $50 million as the streaming offering was designed and staffed by more than 100 employees. Shutdown costs are likely to add millions more at an inopportune time given the austerity drive and cutbacks rippling through the traditional media sector. With a mixed bag including better movie studio results but disappointing NBA ratings and expenses for things like password sharing and other streaming initiatives, Ehrlich sees “several moving parts” and “unknowns” in play for Disney. Big Tech executives at Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, meanwhile, usually keep their strategic cards close to the vest as they report earnings. This time, they will be speaking to investors shortly after gathering together in Washington, D.C. In throwing their support behind President-elect Trump along with major tech figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, the companies are hoping to be rewarded for their loyalty. Trump’s first term was marked by combative and acrimonious relations with the companies, many of which ultimately banned him from their platforms. President Biden’s administration has seen a number of regulatory actions aiming to rein in the companies’ power. Despite a parting warning from Biden about the “oligarchs” attempting to influence American democracy, a shared priority has taken shape among tech companies and government officials: making money through innovation. That’s a political message Wall Street can always endorse. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Trump buzz drives $2.2B inflow, setting new records for Bitcoin and AUM

Market enthusiasm for Trump's era catalyzes all-time high for Bitcoin and trading volumes. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The crypto market has recorded its highest weekly inflow this year, reaching an impressive $2.2 billion. According to the latest CoinShares report, this influx of capital was fueled by growing excitement around Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The firm noted that the surge pushed total year-to-date inflows to $2.8 billion. This influx has also pushed assets under management (AUM) to a record high of $171 billion. The surge coincided with Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the flagship crypto climbing nearly 20% over the past week to hit an all-time high near the $110,000 mark. Meanwhile, the market also experienced a corresponding spike in exchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes, which reached $21 billion last week. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that this number accounted for 34% of Bitcoin’s trading activity on leading exchanges. This robust number highlights growing institutional interest and the increasing mainstream adoption of crypto. Bitcoin continued its dominance, securing $1.9 billion in inflows last week and bringing its total for the year to $2.7 billion. The report highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs, offered by key players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, collectively attracted over $2.1 billion in inflows. The inflows are seen as a positive response to market optimism about supportive regulatory policies expected under the incoming administration. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $500,000, a surprising deviation from typical bearish behavior during bullish trends. Meanwhile, Ethereum drew $246 million in inflows, marking a reversal of its previous outflows this year. However, the second-largest crypto continues to underperform in comparison to its peers. Butterfill noted that Ethereum remains the weakest performer this year from an inflow perspective despite significantly outpacing Solana, which brought in $2.5 million last week. On the other hand, XRP has proven to be a standout performer, attracting $31 million in inflows last week. Since mid-November 2024, XRP’s total inflows have reached an impressive $484 million, underscoring its growing appeal to investors. Stellar followed with smaller inflows of $2.1 million, while other altcoins showed little activity during the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Trump’s ‘Drill Baby Drill’ - Why SLB Could Lead Energy Sector In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2025/01/20/trumps-drill-baby-drillwhy-slb-could-lead-energy-sector-in-2025/

"Drill Baby Drill!" The signature energy battle cry of Donald Trump has returned to center stage as he returns to the White House. His vision for American energy dominance is taking shape with the nomination of Chris Wright, a vocal advocate for fossil fuels, as his choice for Energy Secretary. Wright, 60, made his position clear during his Senate confirmation hearing last week: "Previous administrations have viewed energy as a liability instead of the immense national asset that it is." His appointment signals a dramatic shift from current energy policies, with a laser focus on expanding domestic production across multiple sectors. The Liberty Energy CEO, who is expected to win Senate confirmation, brings a unique perspective to the role. "To compete globally, we must expand energy production, including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas, and cut the cost of energy for Americans," Wright declared during his hearing. His stance represents a stark contrast to the Biden administration's pause on LNG export approvals and restrictions on federal land drilling. The focus on expanded energy production extends beyond the Department of Energy. Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum reinforced this agenda during his confirmation hearing, pledging to vigorously pursue maximizing energy production from U.S. public lands and waters as a national security imperative. His comments signal a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's efforts to limit oil and gas drilling through reduced federal lease auctions and offshore development restrictions aimed at addressing climate change. Wright's vision extends beyond traditional energy sources. As an MIT-trained engineer who studied fusion energy, he supports developing small nuclear power reactors and geothermal energy, while expressing skepticism about the sufficiency of solar and wind power. "The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system," Wright told the Senate energy committee, adding, "Do I wish we could make faster progress, absolutely." This pragmatic approach to energy transition aligns with Trump's broader energy independence agenda. CLEVELAND, OH (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) For investors looking to capitalize on this shift in energy policy, SLB (formerly Schlumberger) presents a compelling opportunity. The company's strong market position was recently highlighted by a 6% surge in its stock price on Friday's trading following better-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings, driven by robust demand for its drilling equipment and technology. The company's confidence in its future is demonstrated by its dividend increase and announcement of a $2.3 billion stock buyback program. As the largest service provider to the oil and gas industry, SLB's global presence across more than 100 countries positions it uniquely to benefit from expanded domestic energy production. The company's Q4 performance, particularly strong gains in its digital and integration business, showcases its technological leadership and operational efficiency. While the energy sector's cyclical nature presents inherent challenges, SLB's valuation suggest significant upside potential. Trading at less than 11 times earnings with a 3% dividend yield, the stock appears undervalued. SLB's aggressive share buyback program and strong financials, combined with its AI integration and low debt levels, position it well for 2025's expected energy expansion. The company's technological leadership and global scale make it an attractive vehicle for investors looking to capitalize on potential U.S. energy policy shifts. As America moves toward more aggressive domestic production, SLB's comprehensive capabilities position it to play a crucial role in this transformation.

Title: Unannounced Warhammer RPG cancelled towards end of last year - report

As Games Workshop seeks next success. An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year. A report by MP1st details posts by former employees of a developer known as Thought Pennies - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles. As with many other companies over the years, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO Daniel Erickson posted: "Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding." This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled. One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'. Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game. This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week. In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.

(Bloomberg) -- Constraints on banks’ ability to take on risk is opening the door for private credit to go after their top-tier clients. And traditional lenders are determined to make the most of it. Most Read from Bloomberg How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters For banks, private credit’s advance into the universe of investment-grade debt isn’t the latest chapter of a years-long rivalry. Rather, the drive is helping them find partners, backed by billions in funds, that are less held back by regulators’ push to minimize lending risks. Private credit is now offering high-value, tailored deals, but leans on traditional lenders to be connected with clients. The opportunity is immense, especially in the infrastructure and asset-backed space. Blackstone Inc. estimates that the potential scope for private high-grade asset-backed loans alone could surpass $30 trillion. In infrastructure, Apollo Global Management and Standard Chartered Plc just last week announced a partnership to invest as much as $3 billion in the low-carbon transition. “It’s a win-win,” Alison Rose, senior adviser at Charterhouse Capital Partners and former chief executive officer of Natwest Group Plc, said at the Bloomberg Women, Money & Power event last month. “If I were sitting in a bank, I could be keeping the relationship, keeping the M&A, I’d have a balance sheet-lite income model, and I could partner with private credit for access to different debt.” Previously, the formula to secure lending was simple: corporates would go to their banks. Flush with deposits, banks would aim to be a one-stop shop for clients. But much stricter regulatory requirements in the wake of the great financial crisis has made some lending simply too capital intensive for banks. In the meantime, private credit’s giants are increasingly teaming up with well-funded insurance partners who are on the lookout for long-dated and higher quality investments, offering fresh firepower for a sector that is looking to expand its $1.6 trillion in assets under management. “One of the biggest trends in private credit is moving into private investment grade or asset backed lending,” Scott Kapnick HPS Investment Partners’ Chief Executive Officer said last year during a teleconference on the firm’s merger with Blackrock Inc. The scale and highly customized nature of what private credit investors have been able to finance is showing to be a world away from the bread-and-butter lending that banks typically do. In November, Blackstone announced a $3.5 billion investment-grade private credit transaction for stakes in gas pipelines owned by EQT Corp. The deal was advised by Citigroup Inc. and RBC Capital Markets LLC. Apollo led a mammoth investment of $11 billion related to an Intel Corp. semiconductor plant in Ireland last year, its largest high-grade private credit transaction to date. Goldman Sachs & Co. acted as lead financial adviser to Intel. Banking Regulation “Bank regulation will continue to drive assets off bank balance sheets and into private capital,” said Leslie Mapondera, Apollo partner and co-head of European credit. “The focus is on finding these bespoke investing opportunities that are perhaps too complex for the investment-grade bond market to stomach.” At present, private credit is strongly relying on referrals from banks for investment-grade deals. Still, the sector views itself as a partner that can help traditional lenders enhance their return on equity. “The relationship with banks is highly symbiotic,” said Rob Horn, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure and asset based credit. “We approach it in a partnership fashion, and are actually enabling them to achieve where they’re going with their business models.” And yet, for all the enthusiasm about a mutually beneficial co-existence, concerns linger over whether private credit would eventually chip away at banks’ position as the primary go-between. “At what point does private credit take the relationship away from the banks?” Rose said. Working Together Private credit’s expansion wouldn’t develop as a seamless partnership of equals, said John Cronin, a financial industry analyst at SeaPoint Insights. “I’d be somewhat cynical about this kind of cozy relationship persisting into the future in perpetuity with no real disruption risk,” he said. Still, private credit is a useful tool for banks to optimize their clients’ capital structure, said Giulio Baratta, BNP Paribas SA’s head of investment-grade finance debt capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Typical deals in the investment-grade space entail subordinated, asset-financing and quasi-equity transactions, he said. “Private credit provides an opportunity for companies that are seeking bespoke forms of financing or capital raising, taking advantage of private credit’s highly customizable nature,” Baratta said. “It is the early stages of something very interesting.” (Updates with comments from HPS’s CEO Scott Kapnick in the seventh paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

As President Donald Trump returns to the White House with a pro-business stance, markets remain optimistic. The average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for ACM Research (ACMR) is equivalent to a Buy.

LONDON (Reuters) -The dollar fell broadly on Monday, while European stocks jumped, after an official for the incoming U.S. administration said President-elect Donald Trump would stop short of imposing tariffs at his inauguration, which takes place later in the day. European equity markets were firmly in positive territory in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported Trump would not impose import tariffs immediately after he's sworn in later on Monday. The dollar tumbled by as much as 1.3% at one point, falling particularly hard against the currencies of the United States' largest trading partners, such as the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the euro and China's yuan. German specialty chemicals maker Lanxess said on Monday it expected its fourth-quarter core profit to exceed market expectations by more than 20%, largely due to pre-buying by U.S. customers ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration given the threat of potential tariffs. Shares in Lanxess, which makes high-end speciality chemicals such as additives, lubricants, flame retardants and plastics, were up 6.4% in afternoon trading. "The fourth quarter was positively influenced by a stronger than expected December, in particular due to customers’ pre-buying," the company said in a statement, flagging that the underlying macroeconomic environment had not improved.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/factboxtrumps-inauguration-marks-new-era-for-cryptocurrency-3820461
Time Published: 2025-01-20T11:45:47Z

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems.

Title: Four Canadian Banks Quit Climate Group as Exodus Begun by Wall Street Picks Up

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they’re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they’re still committed to meeting climate-related targets. The departures raise further questions about NZBA’s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm’s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call “woke” capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven’t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada. Banks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to the group’s website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. NZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its “next phase” to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website. BMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the “mechanism.” He added that the company also has “a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won’t abandon that.” In announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has “robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.” Toronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has “the resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.” Montreal-based National Bank, Canada’s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to “streamline how we report on our plans and our progress.” CIBC said the company recognizes “the scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same” Canadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan. Other climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.

Title: Box, Inc. (BOX) Unveils AI-Powered Enterprise Advanced Plan to Transform Content Management and Workflow Automation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) stands against the other AI stocks. As President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar The order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will "accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy”. According to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an "appropriate share" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis. "It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States”. Several known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector. “So what you get with the Biden administration today is — at least from a signaling perspective — on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward”. According to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses — national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy. AI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the “Economic Blueprint”, it said that "Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage. OpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship. "There's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects —strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company is also delivering Box Doc Gen via API to Enterprise Advanced customers allowing automated document creation by pulling data from third-party apps, custom apps, and metadata. “There is a tremendous amount of value trapped inside enterprise content, but the majority of companies can't harness the full value of their information with existing legacy solutions.

With Enterprise Advanced, Box is delivering an Intelligent Content Management platform in a single offering that empowers businesses to harness the value of their content like never before — all at a fraction of the cost”. Overall BOX ranks 8th on our list of the top AI stocks on analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of BOX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers. There are plenty of great stocks that offer attractive dividends and don't cost too much. Here are my picks for the smartest dividend stocks to buy with $100 right now.

After reaching record highs last year, shares of Monolithic Power Systems have slumped more than 30% since the firm's last earnings report at the end of October, but analysts remain bullish on the stock. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks.

With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Consider these pros and cons before starting a position in this leading cryptocurrency. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts.

Title: What Analysts Think of GE Vernova's Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-ge-vernova-stock-ahead-of-earnings-8775587
Time Published: 2025-01-20T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) is set to report earnings before the market opens Wednesday as the energy company approaches one year since General Electric completed its split into three separate companies. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha are mostly bullish, with 10 rating the stock a "buy," and two giving it a "hold" rating. Their price targets range from $361 to $446, with the average at about $392 sitting below Friday's record level after a strong week for the stock. Shares of GE Vernova gained nearly 3% Friday to close at an all-time high of $401.41, and have nearly tripled in value since their April debut. The company is expected to report revenue of $10.73 billion for the final quarter of 2024, up from $10.04 billion in the same time last year, when it was still part of General Electric. Net income is expected to come in at $634.87 million, after two of the company's first three quarters as a standalone company have resulted in net losses. The company said in previous quarters that its wind segment, the lone unprofitable arm of GE Vernova's three divisions, should be "approaching profitability" by the end of the fiscal year. The company said the shift will take time as it moves away from higher-cost offshore wind projects. Analysts have upgraded GE Vernova or lifted their price targets several times since it became its own company, including Bank of America analysts earlier this week. They have cited the growing demand for energy, especially in renewable forms, to power projects like data centers and artificial intelligence products as a positive catalyst for GE Vernova's sales going forward. The other former GE divisions, GE Aerospace (GE) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), are set to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 23 and Feb. 13, respectively.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares gain and bitcoin hits a record high ahead of U.S. inauguration
URL: https://www.wsbtv.com/news/stock-market-today/T6E6J5TBKJCG3H7QPLPDYR7564/

WSB Now BANGKOK — (AP) — Asian shares advanced early Monday and bitcoin surged to a record high ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for a holiday. The price of bitcoin surged as high as $109,134 early Monday, up from $99,563, according to CoinDesk. Cryptocurrencies have gained substantially since Trump was elected, as investors wagered on his favor for such assets. European benchmarks gained in early trading, with Britain's FTSE 100 edging 0.1% higher to 8,515.80, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% at 7,729.06. Germany's DAX was nearly unchanged at 20,902.00. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.8% to 19,925.81 after China’s central bank kept its key lending rates unchanged. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,244.38. A Hong Kong court extended a deadline for troubled property developer Country Garden to reach an agreement with its creditors until next month in the latest slow step toward recovery from a prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector. Sentiment also was helped by upbeat comments by U.S. and Chinese officials ahead of Trump's inauguration later Monday. Pledges by both sides to work to improve relations may have alleviated some concerns over trade tensions that have built up as businesses brace for a possible increase in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.2% to 38,902.50. The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, trading at 156.17 yen, down from 156.31 yen. Expectations are building that Japan's central bank might raise its key interest rate in a monetary policy meeting later this week. Higher rates tend to boost the value of the yen versus the dollar. The euro rose to $1.0309 from $1.0281. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped 0.1% to 2,520.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 8,347.40. Taiwan's Taiex picked up 0.5% and India's Sensex surged 0.7%. Bangkok's SET gained 0.1%. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 19 cents to $77.20 per barrel and Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 23 cents to $80.56 per barrel. On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% and the Dow rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. SLB helped lead the market after the provider oilfield services delivered bigger profit and revenues for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. It jumped 6.1% after it also raised its dividend by 3.6% and said it’s returning $2.3 billion to its investors by buying back its own stock. All the Big Tech companies in what's come to be known as the " Magnificent Seven " rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Because they're so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks. Such shares have been under pressure recently because of criticism their prices may have shot too high after leading the market for so many years. Such worries grew after Treasury yields jumped in the bond market. Higher yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive. But stocks broadly got a lift this week from an encouraging report on U.S. inflation, which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. More such cuts, which began in September, would ease the brakes off the economy and boost prices for investments, though they can also give inflation more fuel. Wall Street has been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports pushed traders to revamp their expectations about what the Fed will do with rates. Lower worries about inflation have sent Treasury yields down and stocks up, while worsening worries about inflation have triggered the opposite reaction. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: 7 Dividend Stocks That Just Started Paying Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/01/19/7-dividend-stocks-that-just-started-paying-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T17:13:00Z
Full Content:
Finger pressing a car ignition button with the text 2025 start. Ready for the inaugurations? Yes, with a plural. We are talking seven brand-new dividend stock programs today. Dividend payers are our beat here at Contrarian Outlook. And we welcome newcomers because they can really kick off a phenomenon I refer to as the Dividend Magnet. Over long time frames—years—stock prices follow their payout higher. We like dividend growers because they are the surest, safest way to profits in the stock market. Buy a rising payout, sit back, and watch the stock price chase it. New dividend payers can be even better because they tend to grow their dividends quickly. New divvie payers know that they can make new payments comfortably and that they have plenty of dry powder for future increases. Wall Street is increasingly seeing the world the same way we do. A new dividend used to be treated like “the end of growth.” But more and more, investors realize exactly what a new dividend means, and they celebrate it. Just look at what happened to Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) after it announced in February 2024 it would start paying its shareholders: META Total Returns So, what fresh dividends should we have our eyes on? Let’s take a look at a handful of dividend initiations announced over the past six months, including a few distributions that will debut in January 2025. These dividends pay up to 8%+. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 6, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 19, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.10 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.5% LandBridge (LB) is a land management company that owns surface acres in Texas and New Mexico, primarily in the Permian Basin. It generates revenues from surface use royalties, sales of resources such as brackish water and other surface composite materials, and oil and gas royalties. It went public in 2024 at $17 per share, and it has already more than quadrupled. It also announced its first dividend—a 10-cent-per-share quarterly distribution, first paid in December 2024. Dividend Initiation Announcement: July 31, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 20, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.15 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.6% CGI Inc. (GIB) is an IT and business process services provider. CGI has spent decades on public markets, and while its shorter-term growth isn’t nearly as explosive as LandBridge’s, it has more than tripled the index over the past 20 years. CGI has long poured its cash back into the business and on the occasional repurchase. However, CGI announced in late July that it would be paying a dividend for the first time, which it did in December 2024—a 15-cent quarterly dole. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Aug. 14, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Sept. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.14 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 1.7% U.K.-based Marex Group (MRX) provides liquidity, market access, and infrastructure services to clients in financial, energy and commodities markets. These services include clearing, agency and execution, market making, hedging, and other investment solutions. It was founded roughly 20 years ago but only joined the public markets in April 2024. A private equity consortium still owns roughly two-thirds of the company, though it’s possible they will sell off some of that ownership stake over the next few years. Net interest income (NII) has gone from losses in 2019 through 2021 to $29 million in 2022 and nearly $122 million in 2023. Net income has gone up by nearly 300% in that time. Part of that has come from organic share gains in its core markets, but Marex isn’t shy about growing through acquisitions, including Middle Eastern brokerage firm Aarna Capital and Spanish biofuels company Dropet in 2024. So far, investors like what they’ve seen, driving shares 70% higher in less than a year. And virtually all of that has come following the announcement that Marex would start distributing cash to its shareholders. While many European companies pay semiannual dividends, Dropet’s August initiation announcement was for the start of a quarterly payout—a decent 14 cents quarterly that translates to 1.7%. If MRX follows through in the next few years, it could keep up a different European tradition: yielding far more than comparable American companies. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 12, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.04 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Alight (ALIT) provides a variety of cloud-based benefits and business solutions. The benefits side includes administration, healthcare navigation, financial wellbeing, payroll and more, and it does much of this through the online benefits portal Alight Worklife. Meanwhile, the professional segment offers cloud advisory, deployment, and optimization services. Alight is a relatively new publicly traded stock that hit the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). But it hasn’t enjoyed quite the same return as the previous stocks, losing a quarter of its value over the past few years. That’s largely because, while the top line has grown steadily and consistently for years even predating its SPAC listing, Alight hasn’t put up a GAAP profit since 2019, and 2023’s $345 million loss was worse than its prior three years combined. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when ALIT announced in November 2024 that it would start paying a 4-cent quarterly dividend. I say “a bit” because, though it has posted numerous years’ worth of GAAP losses, Alight is profitable on an adjusted basis, and it generates strong cash flows. Also encouraging is that recurring revenues account for roughly 90% of sales, and Alight spends its cash prudently, halving its debt in just five years. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 11, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 21, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.19 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Match Group (MTCH) is easily the best-known name on this list, albeit through its brands, which include Hinge, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Plenty Of Fish and, of course, Tinder—the most downloaded dating app and the highest grossing lifestyle app overall worldwide. Across its various properties, MTCH claims 15.2 million paying customers covering 40 languages. I don’t know that I’ve seen a bigger, ahem, mismatch than MTCH’s stock performance and its operational performance: MTCH Total Returns That’s not to say Match Group doesn’t have some problems on its hands. Revenue growth has slowed, in large part thanks to a two-year pullback in Tinder revenues. The company’s recent outlook for Tinder disappointed. But MTCH is seeing success with Hinge, as well as growth in Asia thanks to Pair and Azar. For now, Match Group is hoping to appease shareholders by throwing wads of cash at them. The company expects to return virtually all of its free cash flow to shareholders over the next few years, via both a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and a new quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 16, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Feb. 14, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.12 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.5% OneSpan (OSPN) is another new dividend payer from the technology sector, this one a cybersecurity company whose core focus rests on identification. Specifically, it offers products such as a cloud-based multifactor authentication solution (including biometrics, push notification, and visual cryptograms); a platform that allows banks and financial institutions to provide identity verification services; a mobile transaction protection development kit; and more. OneSpan is an extraordinarily fickle stock, peaking and burning out several times across more than two decades of trade. Naturally, then, one has to look at its current run—80% gains in a year—with a grain of salt. But perhaps that’s what OneSpan’s new dividend is meant to get under control. In mid-December, OneSpan announced it would start paying a 12-cent quarterly dividend as of Feb. 14, 2025. At today’s prices, that comes out to a 2.5% yield, which is pretty decent for a first-time tech payout. More importantly, the company’s language indicates that it’s keenly aware of the need to provide shareholder returns, saying they’ll consider a “range of options with additional capital allocation,” including share repurchases, special dividends and increases to the quarterly dividend, among others. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Oct. 1, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 31, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.50 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 8.5% South Bow (SOBO) is typical of a new dividend payer in that it’s a spinoff. Specifically, this liquid pipelines business was spun off of Canadian energy infrastructure firm TC Energy (TRP). South Bow, whose name reflects its origins near Canada’s South Bow River, boasts more than 3,000 miles of oil and liquids pipeline infrastructure (most notably the Keystone Pipeline System) connecting Alberta crude oil supplies to U.S. refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company also owns storage terminals in the U.S. and Canada. Energy infrastructure stocks tend to be generous dividend payers, and South Bow is no exception. SOBO came out swinging at the bell—in the same release announcing its launch as an independent company, it also said it expected to declare its first dividend a month later (which it did). The company’s 50-cent quarterly dividend comes out to a yield north of 8%. For obvious reasons, there’s little price history here to study. But as is typical of an MLP, a high amount of its profits are contracted—in South Bow’s case, roughly 88% of comparable EBITDA, at an average remaining contract term of 8.3 years. In other words: Management doesn’t appear to be overreaching with its strong opening distribution. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images The monthly S&P 500 and NASDAQ composite cycles bottomed last week. There may be a minor pullback next month, but the overall uptrend is intact. Netflix is likely to be a leader in this rally. The stock has been strongest in the month of January. From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold. Weekly, we can see that relative strength has been rising since the spring of 2022. The monthly cycle has led price higher, and there is no cycle high until May. The stock is likely to rally over $900 in the next month and to new highs by April. 1-Netflix Daily This stock is very oversold and is due to rally. 2-Netflix Weekly Relative strength is expected to remain strong. 3-Netflix Monthly Cycle The NFLX monthly cycle points to higher prices. Fifth Third Bancorp also reports earnings this week and this report is also likely to be met with buying. Here is why. Daily, there are higher lows in momentum. The January through April time period has been bullish for these shares. In fact, from January 20 through February 16th, the stock has risen about 73% of the time. From the 21st through May 10th, the stock has risen 68% of the time. The third graph is that of the strong monthly price cycle. Thus, we see a combination of both the seasonal static cycle and the monthly dynamic cycle rising at the same time. FITB shares are likely to rally back to the prior $49 high. 1-First Third Bancorp Daily Momentum and relative strength point to better short-term performance. 2- First Third Bancorp Monthly Histogram Seasonality is at a low and strengthens into April. 3- First Third Bancorp Monthly Cycle The monthly price cycle heralds higher quotes.

Title: 1 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Netflix, Procter & Gamble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well.

To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: Why Hundreds of Companies Will Buy Bitcoin in 2025

EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts a treasury revolution, forecasting hundreds of companies to buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset within 18 months, shaping a transformative ‘overlooked megatrend’. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, has issued a bold prediction: hundreds of companies will buy Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the next 12 to 18 months. The shift, which Hougan describes as an “overlooked megatrend,” has the potential to significantly influence Bitcoin’s market trajectory. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. Though ranked only 220th globally by market capitalization, the company’s influence on the Bitcoin market is disproportionate. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy acquired 257,000 BTC—exceeding the total Bitcoin mined that year (218,829 BTC). The company’s ambitions show no signs of slowing. It recently announced plans to raise $42 billion for additional Bitcoin purchases, equivalent to 2.6 years’ worth of Bitcoin’s annual production at current rates. MicroStrategy’s actions are just the tip of the iceberg. According to Hougan, 70 publicly traded companies already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This list includes not only crypto-native firms like Coinbase and Marathon Digital but also mainstream giants like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre. Together, these firms—excluding MicroStrategy—own 141,302 BTC. Private companies are also significant players. SpaceX, Block.one, and others collectively hold at least 368,043 BTC, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.com. Hougan highlights that MicroStrategy’s share of the corporate Bitcoin market is already less than 50% and is likely to decline further as adoption grows. What happens when larger companies, like Meta, which is currently considering a shareholder suggestion to add bitcoin to its balance sheet—20x the size of MicroStrategy start to emulate MicroStrategy’s strategy? Two major barriers have historically constrained corporate adoption of Bitcoin: reputational risk and unfavorable accounting rules. Both have shifted dramatically in recent months: Until recently, companies faced significant hurdles in adopting Bitcoin. CEOs and boards were concerned about shareholder lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and negative media coverage. However, as Bitcoin gains acceptance at institutional and governmental levels, these fears are dissipating. Post-election, Bitcoin has seen growing bipartisan support in Washington, making it increasingly “commonplace—and even popular—to own Bitcoin,” according to Hougan. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a new guideline, ASU 2023-08, that fundamentally changes how Bitcoin is accounted for. Previously, companies were required to mark Bitcoin as an intangible asset, forcing them to write down its value during price declines but preventing upward adjustments when prices rose. Under the new rule, Bitcoin can now be marked to market, allowing companies to recognize profits as its price appreciates. This change removes a significant disincentive and is expected to drive exponential growth in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Corporate motivations for holding Bitcoin mirror those of individual investors. Hougan outlines several reasons: Hougan asserts that the motivations behind corporate adoption matter less than the magnitude of demand. “You just need to look at the numbers,” he writes. “Where does all this demand look like it’s going? And what would that mean for the market?” Hougan’s memo paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin’s future. If hundreds of companies follow MicroStrategy’s lead, the cumulative demand could drive Bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the coming year. With 70 companies already on board under less favorable conditions, the stage is set for an explosion in adoption. This trend not only highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a treasury asset but also underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial instrument. For mature investors, the implications are clear: the next 18 months could mark a pivotal period in Bitcoin’s journey from speculative asset to institutional cornerstone. With reputational risks fading, accounting rules evolving, and demand accelerating, Bitcoin’s integration into corporate treasuries appears inevitable. Hougan’s analysis invites investors to consider the broader implications: If corporations truly embrace Bitcoin at scale, what could that mean for the market’s future? For savvy investors, the answer might lie in acting sooner rather than later. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: The Slop Society

Time Published: 2025-01-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In the last week we've seen the emergence of the true Meta — and the true Mark Zuckerberg — as the company ended its fact-checking program, claiming that (and I quote) "fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created" on both Instagram and Facebook, the latter of which was shown in a study from George Washington University to, by design, "afford antivaccine content producers several means to circumvent the intent of misinformation removal policies." Meta has also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Shortly after announcing the policies, Zuckerberg went on the Joe Rogan Experience and had a full-scale pissfit, claiming that corporations are "culturally neutered" and that companies should have both "more masculine energy" and "[have a culture] that celebrates the aggression a bit more," adding that said culture would "[have] its own merits that are really positive." Zuckerberg believes that modern corporate culture has somehow framed masculinity as bad, something he does not attempt to elaborate upon, frame with any kind of evidence (after all, it's Joe Rogan), or really connect to anything besides a sense of directionless grievance. This means that Meta has now "[gotten rid of] a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate," which in practice means that Meta now allows you to say that being gay is a mental illness or describe immigrants as "filth." Casey Newton at Platformer — who I have been deeply critical of (and will be later in this piece!) — has done an excellent job reporting on exactly how horrifying these policies are, revealing how Meta's internal guidelines allow Facebook users to say that trans people are both mentally ill and don't exist (to be clear, if you feel this way, stop reading and take a quick trip to the garage with your car keys), and included one of the most wretched things I've ever read: that Alex Schultz, Meta's CMO, a gay man, "suggested in an internal post that people seeing their queer friends and family members abused on Facebook and Instagram could lead to increased support for LGBTQ rights." This is the kind of social network that Mark Zuckerberg wants — an unrestrained, unfiltered, unrepentantly toxic and noxiously heteronormative, one untethered by the frustrating norms of "making sure that a social network of billions of people doesn't actively encourage hate of multiple different marginalized groups." Finally, Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever he wants, as opposed to the past 20 years, where it's hard to argue that he's faced an unrelenting series of punishments. Zuckerberg's net worth recently hit $213 billion, he's running a company with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion that he can never be fired from, he owns a 1400-acre compound in Hawaii, and while dealing with all this abject suffering, he was forced to half-heartedly apologize during a senate hearing where he was tortured (translation: made to feel slightly uncomfortable) after only having six years to recover from the last time when nothing happened to him in a senate hearing. Sarcasm aside, few living people have had it easier than Mark Zuckerberg, a man who has been insulated from consequence, risk, and responsibility for nearly twenty years. The sudden (and warranted) hysteria around these monstrous changes has an air of surprise, framing Meta (and Zuckerberg's) moves as a "MAGA-tilt" to "please Donald Trump," which I believe is a comfortable way to frame a situation that is neither sudden nor surprising. Mere months ago, the media was fawning over Mark Zuckerberg's new look, desperate to hear about why he's wearing gold chains, declaring that he had "the swagger of a Roman emperor" and that he had (and I quote the Washington Post) transformed himself from "a dorky, democracy-destroying CEO into a dripped-out, jacked AI accelerationist in the eyes of potential Meta recruits." Zuckerberg was, until this last week, being celebrated for the very thing people are upset about right now — flimsy, self-conscious and performative macho bullshit that only signifies strength to weak men and those credulous enough to accept it, which in this case means "almost every major media outlet." The only thing he did differently this time was come out and say it. After all, there was no punishment or judgment for his last macho media cycle, and if anything he proved that many will accept whatever he says in whatever way he does it. Yet I want to be clear that what you're seeing with Meta — and by extension Zuckerberg — is not a "sudden" move, but the direct result of a man that has never, ever been held in check. It is a fantasy to describe — or even hint — that these changes are the beginning of some sort of unrestrained Meta, rather than part of the intentional destruction of the market leader in growth-at-all-costs Rot Economics. As I wrote in the middle of last year, Meta has spent years gradually making the experience of using its products worse in pursuit of perpetual growth. When I say "intentionally," I mean that product decisions — such as limiting the information in notifications as a means of making users and heavily promoting clickbait headlines as a means of keeping people on the site longer — have been made for years, at times in broad daylight, that have led to the deterioration of the core experiences of both Facebook and Instagram. Some are touting Zuckerberg's current move as some sort of master plan to appease Trump and conservatives, suggesting that this is a "MAGA-fication" of these platforms, where conservatives will somehow be given preferential treatment, such as, say, Facebook's recommendation engine promoting dramatically more conservative media than other sources. Which is something that already fucking happened! In 2020, journalist Kevin Roose created an automated Twitter account called "Facebook's Top 10," listing the top-performing (as in what posts were shared, viewed and commented on the most) link posts by U.S. Facebook pages on a daily basis, something he was able to do by connecting to Facebook's "CrowdTangle" data analytics tool, a product created for researchers and journalists to understand what was happening on the world's largest social network. Roose's reporting revealed that Meta's top-performing links regularly skewed toward right wing influencers like Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro and Sean Hannity, outlets like Fox News, and the page of president-elect Donald Trump. Internally, Meta was freaking out, suggesting to Roose that "engagement" was a misleading measurement of what was popular on Facebook, suggesting the real litmus test being "reach," as in how many people saw it. Roose also reported that internal arguments at Meta led it to suggesting it’d make a Twitter account of its own that had a more "balanced" view based on internal data. Meta even suggested the obvious answer — sharing reach data — would vindicate its position, only for CrowdTangle's CEO to add that "false and misleading news stories also rose to the top of those lists." These stories danced around one important detail: that these stories were likely recommended by Facebook's algorithm, which has reliably and repeatedly skewed conservative for many years. A study in The Economist from September 2020 found that the most popular American media outlets on Facebook in a one month period were Breitbart and Fox News, and that both Facebook page engagements and website views heavily skewed conservative. While one could argue that this might be the will of the users, what a user sees on Facebook is almost entirely algorithmic, and thus it's reasonable to assume that said algorithm was deliberately pushing conservative content. At this time, Meta's Head of Public Policy was Joel Kaplan, a man whose previous work involved working as George W. Bush's Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, as well as handling public policy and affairs for Energy Future Holdings, which involved three private equity firms buying Texas power company TXU for $45 billion and immediately steering it into bankruptcy due to the $38.7 billion in debt Energy Future Holdings was forced to take on as a means of acquiring TXU. Jeff Horwitz reports in his book Broken Code that Kaplan personally intervened when Facebook's health team attempted to remove COVID conspiracy movie Plandemic from its recommendation engine, and Facebook only did so once Roose reported that it was the most-engaged link in a 24 hour period. Naturally, Meta's choice wasn't to "fix things" or "improve" or "take responsibility." By the end of 2021, Meta had disbanded the team that ran CrowdTangle, and in early 2022, the company had stopped registering new users. In early 2024 — months before the 2024 elections — CrowdTangle was officially shut down, though Facebook Top 10 had stopped working in the middle of 2023. Meta hasn't "made a right-wing turn." It’s been an active arm of the right wing media for nearly a decade, actively empowering noxious demagogues like Alex Jones, allowing him to evade bans and build massive private online groups on the platform to disseminate content. A report from November 2021 by Media Matters found that Facebook had tweaked its news algorithm in 2021, helping right-leaning news and politics pages to outperform other pages using "sensational and divisive content." Another Media Matters report from 2023 found that conservatives were continually earning more total interactions than left or non-aligned pages between January 1 2020 and December 31 2022, even as the company was actively deprioritizing political content. A 2024 report from non-profit GLAAD found that Meta had continually allowed widespread anti-trans hate content across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, with the company either claiming that the content didn't violate its community standards or ignoring reports entirely. While we can — and should — actively decry Meta's disgusting new standards, it's ahistorical to pretend that this was a company that gave a shit about any of this stuff, or took it seriously, or sought to protect marginalized people. It's a testament to the weak and inconsistent approach that the media has taken to both Meta and Mark Zuckerberg that any of these changes are being framed as anything other than Meta formalizing the quiet reality of its platforms: that whatever gets engagement is justified, even if it's hateful, racist, violent, cruel, or bigoted. To quote Facebook's then-Vice President Andrew Bosworth in an internal email from 2017, "all the work that [Facebook] does in growth is justified," even if it's bullying, or a terrorist attack, and yes, that's exactly what he said. One might think that Bosworth would be fired for sending this email. He's now Meta's Chief Technology Officer. It's time to stop pretending that this company was ever something noble, or good, or well-meaning. Mark Zuckerberg is a repressed coward, as far from "manly" as one can get, because true masculinity is a sense of responsibility for both oneself and others, and finding strength in supporting and uplifting them with sincerity and honesty. Meta, as an institution, has been rotten for years, making trillions of dollars as it continually makes the service worse, all to force users to spend more time on the site, even if it's because Facebook and Instagram are now engineered to interrupt users' decisionmaking and autonomy with a constant slew of different forms of sponsored and algorithmicly-curated content. The quality of the experience — something the media has categorically failed in covering — has never been lower on either Facebook or Instagram. I am not sure how anyone writing about this company for the last few years has been able to do so with a straight face. The products suck, they're getting worse, and yet the company has never been more profitable. Facebook is crammed with fake accounts, AI-generated slop, and nonsense groups teeming with boomers posting that they "wish we'd return to a culture of respect" as they're recommended their third racist meme of the day. Instagram is a carousel of screen-filling sponsored and recommended content, and users are constantly battling with these products to actually see the things that they log on to see. I want to be explicit here: for years, using Facebook has been a nightmare for many, many years. And, to repeat myself, this has been the case for years. Meta has been gradually (yet aggressively) reducing the quality of the Facebook and Instagram experience with utter disregard for user safety, all while flagrantly ignoring its own supposed quality and safety standards. It's a comfortable lie to say that Meta has "suddenly" done something, because it gives the media (and society at large) air cover for ignoring a gaping wound in the internet. Two of the world's largest social networks are run — and have been run — with a blatant contempt for the user, misinforming and harming people at scale, making the things they want to see harder to find as they're swamped by an endless stream of sponsored and recommended content that either sells them something or gets them to engage further with the platform with little care whether the engagement is positive, fun or useful. Casey Newton of Platformer has done an admirable job covering Meta in the last two weeks, but it's important to note that he was cheerfully covering Zuckerberg's "expansive view of the future" as recently as September 25, 2024, happily publishing how "Zuckerberg was back on the offensive," somehow not seeing anything worrying about Zuckerberg's t-shirt referencing Julius Caesar, the historic dictator that perpetuated a genocide in the Gallic wars. Newton felt it unnecessary to mention the utterly atrocious quality of Facebook while quoting Zuck saying things like "in every generation of technology, there is a competition of ideas for what the future should look like." Yet the most loathsome thing Newton published was this: This is paper tiger analysis — stenography for the powerful, masked as deep thoughts. This specific paragraph is exactly where Newton could've said something about how worrying Zuckerberg modeling himself on a Roman emperor was. How this company was, despite oinking about how it’s building the future, letting its existing products deteriorate as it deliberately turned the screws to juice engagement. Casey Newton has regularly and reliably turned his back on the truth — that Meta's core products are really quite bad — in favor of pumping up various artificial intelligence products and vague promises about a future that just arrived and fucking sucks. The reason I am singling Newton out is that it is very, very important to hold the people that helped Zuckerberg succeed accountable, especially as they attempt to hint that they've always been an aggressive advocate for the truth. Newton is fully capable of real journalism — as proven by his recent coverage — but has chosen again and again to simply print whatever Mark Zuckerberg wants to say. I am also going hard in the paint against Newton because of something else he wrote at the end of last year — "The phony comforts of AI skepticism" — where Newton sloppily stapled together multiple different pieces of marketing collateral to argue that not only was AI the future, but those that critiqued it were doing so in a cynical, corrupt way, singling out independent critic Gary Marcus. I'm not going to go through it in detail — Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so — but I think there are far better comforts for Newton than his ambiguous yet chummy relationship with the powerful. I also did not like something Newton said at the end of a (paywalled) blog about what he learned from the reaction to his piece about AI skeptics. Newton said, and I quote, that he was "taking detailed notes on all bloggers writing ’financial analyses’ suggesting that OpenAI will go bankrupt soon because it's not profitable yet." I do not like bullies, and I do not like threats. Suggesting one is "taking detailed notes on bloggers" is an attempt to intimidate people that are seriously evaluating the fact that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year and has no path to profitability. I don't know if this is about me, nor do I particularly care. I have, however, been taking detailed notes on Casey Newton for quite some time. While Newton's metaverse interview from 2021 was deeply irresponsible in how much outright nonsense it printed, arguably his most disgraceful was his October 26 2021 piece called "The Facebook Papers' missing piece" — an interview with an anonymous "integrity worker" that attempted to undermine the Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files (that revealed in that "Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands"), in a seeming attempt to discredit (by proxy) the bravery of Frances Haugen, the whistleblower that provided the documents that led to this reporting. It's utterly repulsive corporate hand-washing, and it's important context for any criticism he has of Meta going forward, especially if he tries to suggest he's always held it to account. I think Newton seems a little more comfortable with the powerful's messaging than he should. He's argued that while AI companies have hit a scaling wall, it's actually okay, that NFTs went finally mainstream in 2022, that Clubhouse was the future, that live audio was Zuckerberg's "big bet on creators" in 2021 due to "the shift in power from institutions to individuals" (Facebook shut down its podcast service a year later), that — and I cannot see the full text here, because it's paywalled — "metaverse pessimists were missing something" because "Meta's grand vision [was] already well on its way" in November 2021, that Meta's leadership changed its mind about its name because "Facebook [was] not the future of the company," that Axie Infinity — a crypto/web3 Pokémon clone that has created its own form of indentured servitude in the global south backed by Andreessen Horowitz — was "turning gaming on its head" (the game sucks)...okay, I'll stop. Casey has also, at times, had dalliances with criticisms — sometimes even of Facebook! No, really! — but it's hard to take them seriously when he writes a piece for The Verge about how "Google plans to win its antitrust trial," printing the legal and marketing opinion of one of the largest companies in the world knowing full-well that the Department of Justice would not get such an opportunity. In emails revealed in the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google Search, Google specifically mentioned having briefed Newton with the intention of, and I quote, "look[ing] for ways to drive headlines on [Google's] own terms." In Newton's defense, this is standard PR language, but it is, within the context of what I'm writing, hard to ignore. The reason I am so fucking furious at Newton is he is part of the media machine that has helped repeatedly whitewash Mark Zuckerberg and his cronies, running glossy puff-pieces with scumbags like Nick Clegg, and saying things like "the transition away from Facebook’s old friends and family-dominated feeds to Meta’s algorithmic wonderland seems to be proceeding mostly without incident." That line, I add, was published in 2023, two years after the release of The Facebook Files, which revealed that the company knew its algorithmic timeline had a propensity to push users into increasingly-radical echo chambers. And one year after Amnesty International published a report accusing Facebook’s algorithms of “supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar” amidst a genocide that saw an estimated million displaced and tens of thousands massacred. Newton has spent years using his vast platform to subtly defend companies actively making their products worse, occasionally proving he can be a real journalist (his work on the acquisition of Twitter was genuinely great), only to slip back into the comfortable pajamas of "Are We Being Too Mean To Meta?" The media — especially people like Newton — are extremely influential over public policy and the overall way that society views the tech industry. As an experienced, knowledgeable journalist, Newton has too regularly chosen to frame "fair and balanced" as "let's make sure the powerful get their say too." As I've said — and will continue to say — Casey Newton is fully capable of doing some of the literal best journalism in tech, such as his coverage of the horrible lives of Facebook moderators, yet has, up until alarmingly recently, chosen to do otherwise. The cost, by the way, is that the powerful have used Newton and others as mouthpieces to whitewash their contemptuous and half-baked product decisions. I don't know Newton's intentions, nor will I attempt to guess at them. What I will say is that as a result of Casey Newton's work, Mark Zuckerberg and his products have received continual promotion of their ideas and air cover for their failures, directly influencing public opinion in the process. Worse still, Newton has acted for years like nothing was wrong with the quality of platforms themselves. Had Newton written with clarity and purpose about the erosion of quality in Facebook and Instagram, Zuckerberg would have lost a valuable way to convince the 150,000+ people that read Platformer that things were fine, that the quality was fine, that Meta is an innovative company, and that there was no reason to dislike Mark Zuckerberg. There was, and there always will be. Putting aside the horrifying person he obviously is, Zuckerberg is a career liar and a charlatan, and has deliberately made the lives of billions of people worse as a means of increasing revenue growth. And I believe that he's about to inspire a new era of decay, where tech executives, unburdened by their already-flimsy approach to societal norms and customer loyalty, will begin degrading experiences at scale, taking as many liberties as possible. Meta has fired the starting gun of the Slop Society. In an interview with the Financial Times from December 2024, Meta's Vice President of Product for Generative AI (Connor Hayes) said that Meta "expect[s] AIs to actually, over time, exist on [Meta's] platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do," each one having their own bios and profile pictures and the ability to "generate and share content powered by AI on the platform." This came hot off the heels of Zuckerberg saying in a quarterly earnings call that Meta would "...add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way," effectively promising to drop AI slop into feeds already filled full of recommended and sponsored content that gets in the way of you seeing real human beings. This led to a scandal where users discovered what they believed to be brand new AI profiles. Karen Attiah of the Washington Post wrote a long thread on Bluesky (and a piece in the post itself) about her experience talking to a bot she (fairly!) described as "digital blackface," with Meta receiving massive backlash for bots that would happily admit they were trained by a bunch of white people. It turns out these bots had been around for around a year in various forms but were so unpopular that nobody really noticed until the Financial Times story, leading to Meta deleting the bots, at least for now. I am 100% sure that these chatbots will return, because it's fairly obvious that Meta intends to fill your feeds with content either entirely generated or summarized by generative AI, be it with fake profiles or content itself. AI-generated slop already dominates the platform, and as discussed earlier, the quality of the platform has fallen into utter disrepair, mostly because Meta's only concern is keeping you on the platform to show you ads or content it’s been paid to show you, even if the reason you're seeing it is because you can't find the stuff you actually want to find. That's because all roads lead back to the Rot Economy — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that means that the only thing that matters is growth of revenue, which comes from showing as many ads to you as possible. It's almost ridiculous to call us "users" of Facebook at this point. We are the used, the punished, the terrorized, the tricked, the scammed, and the abused, constantly forced to navigate through layers of abstraction between the thing we are allegedly using and the features we'd like to use. It's farcical how little attention has been given to how bad tech products have gotten, and few have decayed as severely as Facebook thanks to its near-monopoly on social media. I, personally, would rather not use Instagram, but there are people I know that I only really speak to there, and I know many people who have the same experience. As Zuckerberg and his ilk are intimately aware, people really don't have anywhere else to go, which — along with a lack of regulation and a compliant media — has given them permission to adjust their services to increase advertising impressions, which in practice means giving you more reasons to stay on the platforms, which means "put more things in the way of what you want to see" rather than "create more compelling experiences for users." It's the same thing that happened with Google Search, where the revenue team pushed the search team to make search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times people searched for things on Google — because a user that finds what they're looking for quickly spends less time on the site looking at ads. It's why the Apple App Store is so chaotically-organized and poorly-curated — Apple makes money on the advertising impressions it gets from you searching — and why so many products on the App Store have expensive and exploitative microtransactions, because Apple makes 30% off of all App Store revenue, even if the app sucks. And I believe that Zuckerberg loosening community standards and killing fact checking is just the beginning of tech's real era of decay. Trump, and by extension those associated with him, win in part by bulldozing norms and good taste. They do things that most of us agree are bad (such as being noxious and cruel, which I realize is a dilution) and would never do, moving the Overton window (the range of acceptable things in a society) further and further into Hell in the process. In this case, we've already seen tech's Overton window shift for years — a lack of media coverage of the actual decay of these products and a lack of accountability for tech executives (both in the media and regulation) has given companies the permission to quietly erode their services, and because everybody made things shittier over time, it became accepted practice to punish and trick customers with dark patterns (design choices to intentionally mislead people) to the point that the FTC found last year that the majority of subscription apps and websites use them. I believe, however, that Zuckerberg is attempting to move it further — to publicly say "we're going to fill your feeds with AI slop" and "we're firing 5% of our workers because they suck" and "we're going to have AI profiles instead of real people on the site you visit to see real people's stuff" and "we don't really give a shit about marginalized people" and "people are too mean to men" knowing, in his position as the CEO of one of the largest tech companies in the world, that people will follow. Tech has already taken liberties with the digital experience and I believe the Slop Era will be one where experiences will begin to subtly and overtly rot, with companies proudly boasting that they're making "adjustments to user engagement that will provide better business-forward outcomes," which will be code for "make them worse so that we make more money." I realize that there's an obvious thing I'm not saying: that the Trump administration isn't going to be any kind of regulatory force against big tech. Trump is perhaps the most transactional human being ever to grace the earth. Big tech, knowing this, has donated generously to the Trump inaugural fund. It’s why Trump has completely reversed his position on TikTok, having once wanted to ban the platform, now wants to give it a reprieve because he “won youth by 34 points” and “there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” Tech knows that by kissing the ring, it can do whatever it wants. Not that previous governments have been effective at curbing the worst excesses of big tech. Outside of the last few years, and specifically the work done by the FCC under Lina Khan, antitrust against big tech has been incredibly weak, and no meaningful consumer protections exist to keep websites like Facebook or Google functional for consumers, or limit how exploitative they can be. The media has failed to hold them accountable at scale, which has in turn allowed the Overton window to shift on quality, and now that Trump — and the general MAGAfied mindset of "you can say or do whatever you want if you do so confidently or loudly enough" — has risen to power again, so too will an era of outright selfishness and cruelty within the products that consumers use every day, except this time I believe they finally have permission to enter their slop era. I also think that Trump gives them confidence that monopolies like Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft 365 (Microsoft's enterprise monopoly over business productivity software), Google Search, and Google Advertising (remedies will take some time, and the Trump administration will likely limit any punishment it inflicts) will remain unchallenged. What I'm describing is an era of industrial contempt for the consumer, a continuation of what I described in Never Forgive Them, where big tech decides that they will do whatever they want to customers within the boundaries of the law, but with little consideration of good taste, user happiness, or anything other than growth. How this manifests in Facebook and Instagram will be fairly obvious. I believe that the already-decrepit state of these platforms will accelerate. Meta will push as much AI slop as it wants, both created by its generative models and their users, and massively ramp up content that riles up users with little regard for the consequences. Instagram will become more exploitative and more volatile. Instagram ads have been steadily getting more problematic, and I think Meta will start taking ads from just about anyone. This will lead to an initial revenue bump, and then, I hypothesize, a steady bleed of users that will take a few quarters to truly emerge. Elsewhere, we're already seeing the first sign of abusive practices. Both Google and Microsoft are now forcing generative AI features onto customers, with Google grifting business users by increasing the cost of Google Workspace by $2-per-user-per-month along with AI features they don't want, and Microsoft raising the price of consumer Office subscriptions, justifying the move by adding Copilot AI features that, again, customers really don't want. The Information's Jon Victor and Aaron Holmes add that it's yet to be seen what Microsoft does with the corporate customers using Microsoft's 365 productivity suite — adding Copilot costs $30-per-user-per-month — but my hypothesis is it will do exactly the same thing that Google did to its business customers. I should also be clear that the reason they're doing this is that they're desperate. These companies must express growth every single quarterly earnings or see their stock prices crater, and big tech companies have oriented themselves around growth as a result — meaning that they're really not used to having to compete for customers or make products they like. For over a decade, tech has been rewarded for creating growth opportunities empowered by monopolistic practices, and I'd argue that the cultures that created the products that people remember actually liking are long-dead, their evangelists strangled by the soldiers of the Rot Economy. You are, more than likely, already seeing the signs that this is happening. The little features on the products you use that feel broken — like when you try and crop an image on iOS and it sometimes doesn't actually crop it, when the "copy link" button on Google Docs doesn't work, when a Google Search gives you a page of forum links that don't answer your question — and I expect things to get worse, possibly in new and incredibly frustrating ways. I deeply worry that we're going to enter the most irresponsible era of tech yet — not just in the harms that companies allow or perpetuate, but in the full rejection of their stewardship for the products themselves. Our digital lives are already chaotic and poisonous, different incentives warring for our attention, user interfaces corroded by those who believe everything is justified in pursuit of growth. I fear that the subtle little problems you see every day will both multiply and expand, and that the core services we use will break down, because I believe the most powerful in big tech never really gave a shit and no longer believe they have to pretend otherwise.

Title: Jim Cramer Says GE Vernova Inc. (GEV) Will Probably Build Small Nuclear Reactors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said "Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher." He added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer "I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't." He added "And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal." The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated "you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time. Returning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him "The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed." As for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's "Not enough talk about the fires." The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined "I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma." Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added "But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results." One industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, "Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done." He added "And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy." The CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. "Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready." Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, "But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower." Cramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him "Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against" the iPhone designer. He added "It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded "Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. . .it's a libertarian love fest." As for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented "Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun." However, Cramer added, "At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having." He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer: "And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired recently For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An aerial view of the energy producing facility, highlighting its potential of providing utilities to the public. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is an energy company that operates in the power generation and electrification industries. It is also among the handful of firms capable of manufacturing nuclear power reactors. The exposure has served GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) well since the stock is up by a whopping 205% over the past year. The strong share price performance is due to the AI data center industry's thirst for clean power generation which has grown the demand for nuclear power. Cramer, however, isn't a believer in the near-term potential of nuclear power; but, at the same time, he's a fan of GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV): "The company that would probably build them [small nuclear reactors] here is GE Vernova. They don't really have a game plan to do anything before twenty, uh, thirty two." Overall GEV ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Dominating AI and Semiconductor Markets with Record Revenue Growth and Strategic Collaborations

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Garmin's –$40B Pivot
URL: https://www.readtrung.com/p/garmins-40b-pivot
Time Published: 2025-01-18T23:35:06Z
Full Content:
Thanks for subscribing to SatPost. Welcome to the new subscribers that joined from Tyler Cowen’s blog (for “11 Best Things of 2024”) and Tim Ferriss’ Five Bullet Friday e-mail (“Jerry Seinfeld, Ichiro Suzuki and the Pursuit of Mastery”). I am a long-time fan of both and was honored to see their recommendations. Today, we are talking about Garmin (and how the $40B+ GPS pioneer survived the iPhone, Google Maps and Apple Watch). Also this week: Why are Nordic firms so successful? TikTok Ban (?) …and them fire posts (including Zuck) “Necessity is the mother of invention.” I have no idea who made this quote. It goes hard and the internet says Plato but the inspirational bathroom poster I bought from a Thai street market says it was Confucius, so I dunno. Whoever said it, the quote kept popping into my head as I read into the history of Garmin, the hardware technology firm that makes GPS products for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. My interest was piqued by the company’s +63% stock performance in 2024, sending its market cap to an all-time high of $40B+. It’s an impressive achievement when you consider that Garmin — which was founded in 1989 — almost got wiped out by huge challenges from Apple and Google. In 2008, Garmin made ~70% of its $3B+ in sales from personal GPS navigation devices for the car. That business line was completely wrecked by the combined launch of the iPhone and Google Maps in consecutive years. Then, just as the company was finding success with GPS-enabled watches for runners (growing from $0 to $1B between 2008 and 2014), Apple took another dump in Garmin’s front lawn by launching its Watch. Garmin just kept grinding it out and showed some serious corporate resilience. By 2018, Garmin’s sales were back to its previous 2008 highs but with a very different revenue mix. As shown in the chart below, Garmin has completely pivoted from a car navigation company to an outdoor and fitness tracking company with annual sales surpassing $5B. At a high level, Garmin was able to survive Big Tech because it is a vertically-integrated company that spends huge resources on R&D. This combination has allowed it to find new GPS markets, develop products for them and move quickly for the customers. Let’s walk through the story by looking at: The Invention of GPS and Founding of Garmin Pivot from Car Navigation to Outdoor & Fitness Garmin’s Secret Sauce is R&D We have to start the Garmin story in 1973. President Richard Nixon signed the Paris Peace Agreement to end the Vietnam War (after using sketchy backchannels to keep the war going so he could win the 1968 Presidential Election). Tricky Dick was also doing Watergate stuff that would force him to resign a year later. The previous president Lyndon B. Johnson died. OPEC started an oil embargo. Pink Floyd released the greatest album cover ever (“The Dark Side of the Moon”). James Blunt — who def has the funniest bio on X (“Proof that one song is all you need”) — wasn’t born yet but would randomly release a song called “1973” in 2007 (well, he says it’s because “1973” rhymes with “I will always be”). Most relevant for this article, the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated the Global Positioning System (GPS) program to create a robust satellite navigation system. The program was designed for the military at the height of the Cold War (aiming missiles, tracking troop movements). A prototype satellite was launched in 1978 and the constellation was fully operational with 24 satellites by 1993 (curiously, Blunt hasn’t written a song about either of those years). An important detail for the early GPS days is how the US government split the network between military and civilian use. The catalyst for this change was a tragedy: in 1983, a Korean commercial airplane was flying from New York to Seoul and was shot down over Soviet airspace. President Ronald Reagan determined that the commercial availability of GPS would have likely prevented the attack and instructed the DoD to make GPS available for civilian use. They did so by creating two networks: Standard Positioning Service (SPS): Designed for civilian and commercial use, and accurate within 100 meters of a location. Precision Positioning Service (PPS): Designed for military use and accurate within 10 meters of a location. Why was the PPS 10x more accurate than the SPS? Because the DoD purposely scrambled the SPS so that enemy forces couldn’t take the civilian service and get the same capabilities as the US military. The private sector soon began experimenting with GPS technology. It was free to use but required (pretty expensive) antenna and receiver equipment. Early adopters included the oil & gas industry as well as customers that owned yachts and private planes (aka rich folk with a lot of cheddar). Two people interested in the GPS consumer market were Gary Burrell and Min Kao. Burrell was born in Kansas and had a Masters in electrical engineering from Wichita State University. Kao was born in Taiwan and moved to America to get advanced degrees including a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee. In 1989 — when Kao was 50 and Burrell was 52 — they were both working as engineers at avionics firm AppliedSignals. The pair got to chatting and decided to launch a company that would sell GPS navigation devices. “The idea for Garmin was conceived during a casual dinner conversation with [my colleague Burrell],” says Kao about the company's founding moment in an interview with The Huffington Post in 2012. “The GPS constellation was still under construction, and it was being developed primarily for military purposes, but Gary and I began discussing its potential as the base technology for a wide array of consumer products. Our conversation became more animated when we envisioned creating products that would help guide pilots, boaters, drivers, and hikers safely and efficiently on their journeys.” They raised $4m from their own savings, family and friends to open a factory in Kansas under the name ProNav. It was the only money they ever had to raise because they came out the gate like gangbusters. The first product was released in 1990 and was a GPS navigation device for small boats and planes. It was an instant smash hit, with even the US Army purchasing their GPS devices for use in the Gulf War. A year later, they opened up a manufacturing plant in Taiwan. This early success was followed by a name change to Garmin, which combined the co-founders’ first names. The portmanteau signified that they “were personally invested in its success or failure” (side note: they definitely did the right order of names because “MinGar” would not have survived as a corporate entity for more than 6 months). By 1995, Garmin was already making $100m+ a year. Crucially, Kao and Burrell were hardcore technologists and not slick-backed hair MBAs. While Corporate America was going asset-light and outsourcing manufacturing overseas, Garmin brought more of its business in-house. They were engineering-first and owned their own distributors, warehouses, marketing teams and customer support call centres. Further, they re-invested funds into building new factories (Kansas, Taiwan), hiring R&D talent and applying for patents. Garmin’s approach had financial costs and took time but also allowed the company to quickly capitalize on new GPS-related opportunities. One such opportunity was a portable car navigator called the StreetPilot. Launched in 1998, the device — which looks quite comical now but probably gave pizza delivery drivers a massive chub — set Garmin up for an explosive decade of growth. In May 2000, President Bill Clinton put into effect a new policy that completely changed Garmin’s fortunes. According to this profile video of Garmin by CNBC, the President “issued an order for the military to stop scrambling civilian GPS technology, making it far more accurate and opening the GPS device market to all sorts of competition.” The impetus for Clinton’s decision was that the military had figured out other ways to jam enemy mis-use of the GPS network. And, of course, there were massive civilian opportunities for innovation and business. Even as the DotCom Bubble was bursting, Garmin was well-positioned as a GPS play (pun intended) and IPO’d in December 2000. Its public debut kicked off an incredible 8-year run that would see revenue 10x from $346m in 2000 to $3.5B in 2008 (when car navigation GPS devices — aka personal navigation devices (PND) — made up 70% of sales). There were competitors such as Magellan, Honeywell and TomTom but Garmin became the go-to consumer brand for GPS in the car. The sales boom was catalyzed by: growing awareness of Garmin automakers trying to soup up their vehicles improved accuracy of GPS navigation integration of WiFi for routing and traffic data lower input costs (growth in consumer demand for electronics led to a decrease in costs for items Garmin required such as microchips, LCD screens, antennas, batteries etc.) the experience curve (which is when the cost of making a product declines due to higher volumes and more learnings) The earliest GPS devices from the 1980s cost north of $10,000. Garmin’s first StreetPilot devices were ~$600 and fell to about $300 in 2008 (with way more features than the first version including voice, navigation, color and better mapping). All of this progress hit a wall in 2009. Launched in 2007, the iPhone had kicked off a smartphone revolution. Then Google Maps’ came out a year later with a price point of $0, which was slightly more appealing to customers than $300+. According to multiple anonymous sources at the company, here is a photo of the executives when they saw the launch of the Google Maps app: Over the next two years, Garmin’s sales fell from $3.5B in 2008 to $2.7B in 2010. Garmin sales wouldn’t fall any further but — as mentioned earlier — it took a decade for Garmin’s sales to get back to $3.5B. If you adjust for inflation, Garmin didn’t get back to its 2008 revenue high-water mark until 2023. The largest peak-to-trough drawdown for Garmin’s stock was ~90% (taking its market cap to under $3B in Q4 2008, with additional pain from the Great Financial Crisis). Fortunately, the company’s salvation was already cooking internally. Remember how we talked about Garmin’s commitment to R&D? Just as they had found a way to take the GPS from the ocean (boats) to air (planes) to the street (cars), Garmin’s R&D team had identified fitness as a niche market all the way back in 2003. Here’s the origin story according to Fortune: For all the time, effort, and money companies plow into the endless hunt for innovation, many of their best ideas come from within. A Procter & Gamble chemist in the 19th century figured a bar of soap that floated in the tub would enliven the bathing experience, and Ivory Soap was born. In the 1970s, a 3M employee, craving a better way to mark pages in his hymnal, modified an uncommercialized adhesive invented a few years earlier by a colleague; Post-it Notes became an iconic 3M success story. And at Garmin, a suburban Kansas maker of navigational devices for boats, planes, and cars, a group of running-obsessed employees applied their know-how to their hobby—a move that revitalized the company when it badly needed a win. It was the early 2000s, and Garmin had grown from its niche of making consumer devices utilizing the government’s global positioning system, or GPS, technology. Together with rival TomTom, Garmin dominated the market for in-car navigational devices, game-changing gadgets that marked the beginning of the end for foldable maps. GPS for personal fitness wasn’t popular before the Garmin jogging klatch began noodling. “They said, ‘We do all these GPS things. Why don’t we have a GPS product for runners?’ ” recalls Cliff Pemble, Garmin’s CEO and a 31-year company veteran. In 2003, Garmin offered its first fitness wearable, the Forerunner 101. What began as an employee side project has come to define the company nearly two decades on—especially after a lethal technology combination of the iPhone and Google Maps laid waste to Garmin’s core automotive business. The transition from car navigation to fitness GPS was far from seamless, though. Garmin’s first instinct to take on the iPhone/Google Maps disruption was to make its own mobile device. In 2008, the company collaborated with Asus to release the G60 Nuviphone, a GPS-enabled phone with a 3.5 inch screen running on Windows Mobile (lol). The Nuviphone cost $300 and if you bought it instead of just a fully-featured iPhone that was under $500 subsidized by carriers, then you were a completely lost cause and hopefully re-evaluated your entire life afterwards. However, very few people chose the “lost cause and need to re-evaluate your life” route and Garmin discontinued the product in 2010. Around this time, Garmin also took a few shots at making subscription-based apps for iPhone and Android. Nothing stuck. While these attempts at new mobile business lines didn’t take off, the aforementioned Forerunner — the pager-sized device that became the world’s first GPS-powered trainer — had catalyzed a fitness segment including watches and trackers that reached $400m in 2008 (10%+ of Garmin’s total sales). Building off that base, Garmin kept improving the form factor and integrating more features (activity tracking, training plans for niche sports, sleep coaching, stored maps, better battery life, lights). One notable outcome from Garmin’s approach is that it’s able to price discriminate to a very fine T. Customers have so many options to pay for the exact functionality they need. Garmin’s fitness segment crossed $1B for the first time in 2015. As fate would have it, Apple began selling its Watch in March of the same year. The Apple Watch has gone on to sell over 100m units and totally re-make the industry. A lot of other watchmakers have been crushed but Garmin — despite initial (and very valid) concerns — has continued to truck along even as Apple positioned its Watch as a health and fitness device. Why have Garmin watches been able to thrive? A Reddit discussion from last summer had some solid insights: “Apple Watch is a Smartwatch with fitness features, Garmin is a Fitness watch (with admittedly lacking) smartwatch features. I think if you get an Apple Watch expecting it to do Garmin'esque things you'll be disappointed, especially in terms of battery life.” “Garmin offers more and — typically with Apple’s yearly release schedule — I don’t see Apple matching Garmin’s functionality anytime soon.” [Note: Garmin fitness watches start at $300 and can get up to $3000; Apple Watch also starts at ~$300 and its fitness-focussed Ultra 2 is $1200). “Apple is still playing catch up with Garmin for running. Even with the [recent software] update, I don’t believe Apple has equivalents for Garmin’s Training Readiness, Body Battery, Race Predictor, or Daily Suggested Workouts to name a few.” “Even with all of Apple’s new updates, the big issue is still battery. You're going to be logging some substantial miles and I hated always having to make sure I had enough juice to make it through my run at the end of the day. 13-15% left on my Garmin and I can still make it a whole day.” [Note: Garmin’s highest-end watches can last up to a month with solar charging; the Apple Watch Ultra 2 lasts up to 3 days] For fitness enthusiasts, Garmin is just a much-more focussed offering. The company’s success with watches is the best example of a more general theme: Garmin continually finds niches for GPS technology and spends a ton on R&D to invent products that appeal to high-value customers in each vertical (to give an idea of Garmin's business model, its operating margin of 28% is comparable to Ferrari; Apple is at 30% but also has a massive software business to complement its hardware). Let’s unpack this strategy more in the final section. People, it’s napkin math time. Using my very subpar spreadsheet skills, I pulled up the old Garmin 10-K filings and wanted to see if the company’s R&D bonafides are reflected in the hard numbers. Here are the stats: Since 2000, Garmin’s R&D staff has averaged 26% of all full-time employees (one study from the National Science Foundation found that R&D typically made up 6%-12% of staff depending on industry and size). From 2000-2023, Garmin’s R&D spend has averaged 12% of sales. But — BUT — there was a clear trend after the iPhone/Google Maps double whammy: from 2000-2008, R&D averaged 7% of sales but since then R&D has been 14% of sales (the same splits for R&D staff is 21% of all employees from 2000-08 to 29% of all employees in the 15+ years since). In sum: Garmin clearly went hard on R&D when it realized its car GPS navigation device cash cow was toast. Instead of milking whatever business it could and cutting costs, Garmin went on the offensive and has stayed on the offensive. As a point of comparison, Garmin’s R&D spend hitting 17% of sales in 2023 is significantly more than Apple and very competitive with the leading Big Tech firms: Meta (R&D spend is 27% of sales), Amazon (15%), Alphabet (14%), Nvidia (14%), Microsoft (12%) and Apple (8%). The fruits of Garmin’s R&D outlay isn’t just in the fitness division. A scroll through the website shows countless niche GPS products for automotive (dash-cams for trucking, motorbikes, RVs etc), outdoor (satellite comms, weather tracking, emergency messaging), nautical (fishing sonar, autopilot, radar mapping) and aviation (flight controls and touchscreens). The ramped-up R&D spend over the past decade has come under Garmin’s current CEO Clifton Pemble. He took over the top spot in 2013 when Min Kao retired. Kao remains Executive Chairman and is now worth $7B, one of America’s wealthiest self-made billionaires (Burrell left Garmin's management in 2002 and became Chairman Emeritus before passing away in 2019). While the co-founders are no longer in leadership positions, Garmin’s DNA has allowed it to successfully adapt to competitive threats. We’ve discussed the company’s engineering-first approach and emphasis on R&D. Kao highlighted some other notable corporate attributes in that 2012 Huffington Post interview: Fiscally conservative: “Gary and I both are fiscally conservative by nature, and we managed our company accordingly. Our early success bred more success. We reinvested in the company and established disciplines like having cash in the bank, maintaining sufficient inventory levels, and staying debt-free. Those practices helped avoid a lot of hurdles. We pioneered new products, new markets, and systems that integrated a variety of technologies which enabled us to supply complete glass cockpits to airplanes, full lines of electronics for boats and in-dash 'infotainment' systems for cars today. Our expansion into global markets, selling directly to consumers, happened quickly and relatively smoothly.” Deep relationships with original electronic manufactures (OEMs): “Our business to business development was much more challenging. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) businesses in aviation, marine, and automotive industries all have very long development cycles, and a very strong tendency to stay with existing suppliers instead of seeking new partners. We persevered though, and over the years, we’ve developed deep relationships with some of the world’s leading OEMs, like Cessna, Embraer, BMW, and Chrysler.” Vertically-integrated: “From the beginning though, Gary and I believed in our business model of vertical integration — a philosophy that keeps all design, manufacturing, marketing and warehouse processes in-house. By doing so, we have been able to have greater control over timelines, quality and service. It might have been easier in the short term to offload many of these functions, but in the long run, we've learned that by controlling the entire process, we’ve had higher levels of innovation, reduced risks, lower costs, and greater scalability.” Cater to customer needs: “My partner, Gary, liked to say, 'we live and die by customers' perception of our products'. By concentrating on great products that delight customers, our brand takes care of itself.” [Side note: Garmin has also spent decades working in regulated industries such as aviation and cars, so the company understands the needs of regulators around privacy and sensitive data; this understanding helps it to port GPS-related technology from one regulated industry to another] So far, this foundation has worked for Garmin to survive Biggie Big Tech (iPhone/Google Maps and Apple Watch). It’ll have to keep drawing from this tradition because the competition is relentless and has a seeming endless appetite to take a dump on Garmin’s lawns. Example: last month, Garmin sold off after Apple announced that it would enable satellite communication in its smartwatches, a direct hit on Garmin’s various satellite outdoor devices.

Carlsberg (Denmark): The 6th largest brewer in the world. Spotify (Sweden): The world’s #1 music streamer. Rovio and Supercell (Finland): Leading mobile game developers (“Angry Birds”, “Clash of Clans”). The magazine cites 4 reasons for Nordic corporate success (and shockingly none of them involve a sauna): Internationalization: The Nordic market is small, so ambitious firms have to build for global markets (leading US firms generate 46% of revenue domestically; that figure is just 2% for leading Nordic firms). Early adopters of technology: LEGO famously rode the plastics revolution in the 1950s and IKEA innovated furniture with flat packing. Today, Nordic firms are faster to digitize than their European counterparts (eg. much higher cloud computing usage). Government policy: Personal tax rate is high but corporate tax is in line with America. High income taxes fund social safety net programs that help de-risk the entrepreneurial route (on that note: the Heritage Foundation ranks Denmark, Norway, Sweden in the top ten of countries worldwide for economic freedom). Patient shareholders: 4/5ths of “large Nordic companies have long-term ownership, compared with 3/5ths in Europe and only 1/5th in America”, which allows for long-term thinking (private business families — Ikea, LEGO, Maersk, Wallenbergs — are also prominent in region and stymie foreign takeovers) Nordic companies have obviously taken Ls (eg. recent collapse of battery maker Northvolt; previous clapping of Nokia by iPhone). But still impressive results! *** TikTok Ban (?): This TikTok situation is wild. I’m writing this on Friday morning and here is a catch-up: The US Supreme Court upheld a law that forces TikTok — which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance (with the CCP on the company’s board) — to either sell the app or it will be banned in America on January 19th (Sunday). The Court determined that the app’s national security risks outweighed 1st Amendment Free Speech considerations. Functionally, a ban means that the iOS App Store and Google Play Store will stop allowing new downloads of the app and block updates (so the app will slowly degrade). TikTok said it would just shut down the app (from a PR perspective, this would make the most noise and get a groundswell of users being real PO’d). President Donald Trump takes office on January 20th and there is talk that he wants to give TikTok up to 90 days more to try to sell. There is reporting that the Chinese government — which is the ultimate decider — may allow Elon to buy TikTok. The price would be in the $50B-$100B range. This is very speculative. It’s not clear how financing would be done and whether an app sale would include the algorithm (which the Chinese government has previously said it would not sell). Prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) have the probability of a full TikTok shutdown by May at 80%+. One data point for the other ~20% (aka Trump brokering a deal) is that the TikTok CEO has been invited to the Presidential Inauguration (to sit on the dais with other Big Tech CEOs). In a total hypothetical, Elon buying TikTok and combining it with X/xAI would immediately create a $100-200B company. I’ve been on the “US should ban TikTok” train for a long time and wrote about it here. The simplest argument is that having a geopolitical rival own a key communication channel is kind of absurd. During the Cold War, it would have been unfathomable for the Soviet Union to own ABC/CBS/NBC. TikTok's algorithm has been shown to boost pro-CCP and throttle anti-CCP content. Not to mention how basically every single foreign media and tech social platform is blocked in China. With over 150m+ users in the US, many creators (and related businesses) will definitely be impacted by the ban. But it’s worth noting that when India banned TikTok a few years back, most users quickly migrated to Instagram and YouTube and the disruption was short-lived. There have been a number of credible TikTok acquisition offers and the fact that the CCP won’t allow the sale — and is willing to incinerate $100B in value — is basically all you need to know about the app’s strategic significance. Since the situation is so fluid, there are definitely updates to come. In the meantime, here is a series of hysterical links related to the app’s upcoming ban. Specifically, I want to highlight a social app called Xiaohongshu, which translates to "RedNote" or really "Little Red Book" (the app’s founder says the name refers to the color of his alma-mater Stanford but it’s hard to miss the fact the “Little Red Book” is also the collection of Mao sayings that tens of millions of Chinese citizens had to memorize during the Cultural Revolution). Over the past week, 1m+ TikTok users — using hashtag #TikTokRefugees — have migrated to Little Red Book. This app is more comparable to Instagram/Pinterest, but TikTok-ers have gone to post there anyways. Some notable posts from this cultural exchange: Some legit wholesome cultural exchange. But also: American users trying to stick it to the US government by downloading a new Chinese app after the Supreme Court blocked another Chinese app, only to find that the new Chinese app severely represses speech on a number of topics. American male users trying to rizz local females (“ni hao hot shyt”). The CCP realizing that American users may spread foundational Western ideas (or, really, just complete brainrot viral trends) and telling the app to block Western posts from the rest of the app. American users helping Chinese users with English homework. Users on both TikTok and Little Red Book making jokes that they are “Chinese Spies”. One parody account of a "Chinese" user who will make you cry laughing (make sure you're sitting down for this one). Duolingo’s shares jumping +7% after a huge uptick in users trying to learn Mandarin and the company's X account posting this absolute gem: “oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin”. More to come next week, I’m sure! *** Some other links: “How Watch Duty’s wildfire tracking app became a crucial lifeline for LA” (The Verge) “Brad Pitt scammer who conned French woman out of £700,000 is tracked down in Nigeria... and revealed to be posing as another A-list star in new scam” (DailyMail) “David Lynch, Auteur Drawn to the Dark and the Dreamlike, Dies at 78” (The Hollywood Reporter) …and them fire posts (including me giving a shoutout to Atomic Habits author James Clear on New Year’s Day and him re-posting in acknowledgement that he’s locked down the “book you must buy for New Year Resolutions”): Finally, as many of you probably know, Zuck made a number of changes to Meta in recent weeks. The main thrust is that he’s dialling back Meta’s censorship regime including getting rid of third-party fact-checking (replacing it with X’s Community Notes system), moving content moderation teams from California to Texas (because of political bias in his view) and allowing people to cover topics previously throttled on Facebook, Instagram and Threads (trans, immigration and a lot of other political chatter). While he acknowledged that this could lead to more bad stuff on the platform, it also means that Meta won't be nuking millions of legitimate posts. Zuck Master Flex went on Rogan to explain his free speech stance and why he is making the changes (and someone left an amazing comment on the video: “Zuck looked at Jack Harlow and said, ‘yep, that’s my look now.’”). One reason was that the Biden administration was really pressing its thumb to censor speech and probably violating the 1st Amendment (particularly around COVID issues). Many critics note this looks like a cynical ploy to suck up to the incoming Trump administration. Yes, obviously it is. To wit: Zuck put Trump’s friend and UFC founder Dana White on the board and also made veteran Republican operator Joel Kaplan the head of Meta’s global policy team (replacing left-leaning Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM of Britain). He also ended various DEI policies around hiring and vendor relationships. But also, Meta is a $1.5T company and it’s in his interest to have a productive relationship with government in power (especially with ongoing anti-trust cases). I do think Zuck’s position on allowing free-er speech has always been his preference. So, we'll see if he stays consistent. Either way, it basically took Elon changing Twitter/X and taking all the slings and arrows for two years — and then Trump getting re-elected — before Zuck felt he could make the move. With Zuck bringing the 3.5B users on all Meta platforms closer to X-style moderation after nearly a decade of extreme censorship pressure from government, NGOs and mainstream media to police the platform in the most Orwellian way possible…it’s pretty clear that Elon’s purchase of X was a true fork-in-the-road moment. I’ll write more on that but wanted to share memes from the funniest running joke of Meta’s pivot. On the Rogan podcast, Zuck — who has obviously been getting jacked and training MMA — said that corporate America needs to bring back “masculine energy”. And that it’s important to have the balance with feminine energy at the workplace. Anyway, here are some very related posts (including this first video clip): Without realizing I was an early adopter I bought the original Garmin watch in 2006 to replace my polar HR. I’ve since bought 4 more just because they were getting better though one might have failed. 2 years ago I talked to someone still using the original and happy with it. Says something for the quality. We also bought the GPS for the car but put it off too long and didn’t get much use before it was replaced with google but it did make a trip to France easier. I’ve added their scale and BP monitor so I can automatically keep it all in one app. Good marketing on their part. Great topic choice. I'm a longtime user/fan of their watches, precisely because they only do what they need to do. Also amazed by their survival/transition from the PND market (those were on every cabbie's dashboard. Oh wait...) to what they are today. Keep it up! No posts Ready for more?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. With everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence “superpower”. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar Starmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade. “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We’re going to make the breakthroughs, we’re going to create the wealth, and we’re going to make AI work for everyone in our country”. Another country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that “the world’s AI runs on American rails” and keep it out of the hands of “malicious actors” who could use it to threaten the United States. Even though the US government may think it’s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don’t necessarily agree. “In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance”. Chipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not “mitigate any threat” but only “weaken America’s global competitiveness” and undermine its innovation. “By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

We recently published a list of These 10 Firms Took A Hit on Friday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other firms that took a hit on Friday. Wall Street’s main indices all finished in the green territory on Friday, as investors repositioned their portfolios ahead of president-elect Donald Trump’s return to office. The Dow jumped by 0.78 percent, while the S&P surged by 1 percent. Meanwhile, Nasdaq soared 1.51 percent. However, ten companies under mixed sectors bucked an overall positive market sentiment as multiple negative factors put pressure on investor sentiment. In this article, let’s look at the reasons that dragged their shares performance. To come up with the top 10 losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), a multinational pharmaceutical company, saw its share prices on Friday retreat by 5.27 percent to finish at $78.69 after following news that the company’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss treatment Wegovy are among the 15 drugs targeted for Medicare price negotiations for 2027. A report said Friday that the negotiation process was in line with outgoing president Joe Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, where 15 new drugs are set to undergo a negotiation process for being among the most expensive drugs. It can be learned that drug pricing concerns have already helped drag down the company’s valuation last year, alongside increasing competition for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes medicines. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Denmark-based firm that owns drug brands such as Levemir, Tresiba, NovoLog, Novolin R, and Novolin N. Overall, NVO ranks 6th on our list of firms that took a hit on Friday.

Title: How a 'low performer' label makes things worse for laid-off workers
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-label-meta-microsoft-layoffs-impact-recruiters-experts-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-18T16:48:15Z
Full Content:
Targeting "low performers" might seem like a logical tactic for big companies looking to streamline their workforces. But when Meta and Microsoft recently announced performance-based cuts, it sparked a debate online about the potential impacts of publicly labeling someone a "low performer" — a term loaded with negative connotations. Layoffs can already be traumatic for workers, and experts say such tags only compound the issue, creating new obstacles for those back on the job hunt. "Here's the real deal — a 'low performer' at Meta could be a rockstar anywhere else," Jan Tegze, a Czech Republic-based tech recruiter, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. But now, these "people have to job hunt with this label hanging over them. Every recruiter, every hiring manager will see these headlines." Jennifer Dulski, the founder and CEO of Rising Team and a management lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, said on LinkedIn that it was "reasonable to let people go for lower performance than others on the team, and to share that reasoning with them." "However, publicly branding employees as low performers serves no one — not the individuals, not the remaining team, and not the company's reputation," she added. "That will stick with and damage many people's careers. It's unnecessary and punitive," Jonathan Shottan, chief product and content officer at Tonal, said. Previous research has suggested that finding a job may be more difficult for laid-off workers due to the stigma they may encounter among potential employers. And with job seekers also facing a slowing job market and new hurdles such as the ever-expanding rollout of AI in workplaces, the added "low performer" tag may make the job search even trickier. Others have defended Meta and Microsoft's announcements, however. "Who would you fire? Your top performers?" One LinkedIn user wrote in response to Tegze's post. "There isn't a company in the world who would let go of anyone that they didn't think was their lowest performers." "What if.... they 'are' actually low performers," another said. "Stop jumping on the let's bash Zuk bandwagon." In an internal memo seen by Business Insider earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and act quickly to "move out low-performers." The cuts will affect 5% of the company's workforce, equivalent to about 3,600 roles. Microsoft has not announced the number of employees it plans to let go. For those who do find themselves caught in the layoffs, experts have some tips to help ensure they give themselves the best chance of getting back to work. Writing on X, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president, advised those hit by cuts targeting low performers to carefully and openly explain their situation to hiring managers. Evans said it can be natural for recruiters to wonder if an interviewee has performance problems that they should avoid and that "your ability to respond calmly and confidently will matter just as much as the actual content of your answer." "If your entire team or division was cut, this is the strongest story. Be clear about that and say, 'My entire team was cut.' Point them to a news story that verifies your claim if you can," he said. He added: "Never badmouth your old boss or company." "Just like dating, no one wants to start a relationship with someone who isn't over their ex." Business Insider contacted Meta and Microsoft for comment. Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: “I’m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That’s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.” Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $558.8 million One of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company's core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications. Back on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company's serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings. For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company's semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn't fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices. Overall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Somnium VR1 Price Increases Bring Base Model To €3000
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/somnium-vr1-price-increases/
Time Published: 2025-01-17T23:08:00Z
Full Content:
Somnium VR1, the European wide field of view PC VR headset, has just received a price increase for all three remaining variants, bringing the entry price to €3000. It comes two weeks after the company announced it had started shipping to the US, and simplified its lineup down from seven consumer variants to three. Somnium is a Czech startup previously solely focused on its social VR platform Somnium Space. But in late 2021 it announced the Somnium VR1 headset with a monster spec sheet for the time, in partnership with VRgineers - known for its ultra-high end XTAL headsets for enterprise. Originally Somnium VR1 was pitched as a hybrid headset with standalone capabilities via an onboard Snapdragon XR2 chipset, but that idea was ditched in 2022 to focus on making it a solely PC VR headset instead. VR1 uses the same 2880×2880 QD-LCD w/ Mini-LED panels used in Pimax Crystal. The displays have 20000:1 contrast via local dimming, 100% NTSC color gamut, and support 72Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz refresh rate, with an "experimental" 144Hz mode available too. The output brightness to your eyes is 210 nits, around double that of Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. Those displays are paired with large dual-element aspheric lenses Somnium claims deliver a field of view of around 130° horizontal and 105° vertical. That's wider than any other VR headset on the market. Pimax "5K" and "8K" were even wider, but are no longer in production and had significant distortion in the periphery. This focus on expanding field of view is why Somnium VR1 is so bulky in an era of far slimmer pancake lens headsets. Somnium says the price increases are due to production being "far more complex than initially anticipated". Specifically, the company is experiencing quality yield issues with its displays and lenses, requiring complex QA and rejecting some component stock. As for new VR1 orders placed today, Somnium says those will take one to two months to ship, and that it is "trying to accelerate production as fast as we can to meet the demand". Later this year, it plans to start selling spare parts for Somnium VR1 to enable self-repairs. We went hands-on with Somnium VR1 back in July.

Title: Amazon axes 200 jobs in Fashion and Fitness group in US: Report

Full Content:
Amazon is laying off around 200 employees in its Fashion and Fitness group in the US, Business Insider reported. The company confirmed the layoffs, which primarily impacted employees based in San Diego, a group known internally as F2. The decision follows a restructuring effort to optimize team structures for better innovation and customer focus. “We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities. As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” The layoff decision is not connected to the discontinuation of its “Try Before You Buy” program, which allowed customers to try on clothing and footwear before making a purchase. The Try Before You Buy service, launched in 2018, was shuttered earlier this month. However, Amazon clarified that the program’s closure and the job cuts are separate. Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness group is responsible for curating and marketing apparel, footwear, accessories, and fitness equipment. The company continues to explore ways to expand its apparel and fashion categories, despite the challenges of customers often preferring to try items before purchasing. The layoffs signal ongoing internal adjustments in Amazon in a competitive market. Amazon is discontinuing its “Try Before You Buy” service, a program that allowed Prime members to try on select apparel, shoes, and accessories at home before completing their purchase. The company confirmed that the last day customers can place orders using the service will be January 31. The service, launched in 2018 after initial testing under the name Prime Wardrobe in 2017, enabled customers to order up to six clothing items for a trial period. After receiving the merchandise, shoppers had seven days to return any unwanted items without incurring charges. In a statement, Amazon explained that the decision was made due to the program’s limited reach and the increasing use of AI-powered tools to help customers select the right items. “Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option,” an Amazon spokesperson said.

Title: Vanguard settles SEC charges over misleading statements for $106.41 million
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/vanguard-settles-sec-charges-over-misleading-statements-for-10641-million-93CH-3819298
Time Published: 2025-01-17T17:16:30Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- The Vanguard Group, Inc. has agreed to pay $106.41 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over misleading statements related to capital gains distributions and tax consequences for retail investors. The funds in question are Vanguard Investor Target (NYSE:TGT) Retirement Funds (Investor TRFs) held in taxable accounts. The settlement amount will be distributed to affected investors. The SEC order, issued today, reveals that Vanguard had announced on December 11, 2020, that the minimum initial investment amount for Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement Funds (Institutional TRFs) was reduced from $100 million to $5 million. In the months following this announcement, a significant number of retirement plan investors moved their investments from Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs due to lower expenses. To meet the demand for these redemptions, the Investor TRFs had to sell underlying assets with gains, given the rising financial markets that had recovered from pandemic lows. As a result, retail investors in the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities, thereby missing out on potential compounding growth of their investments. The SEC order also found that the prospectuses of Vanguard Investor TRFs, distributed in 2020 and 2021, were materially misleading. They stated that the funds’ distributions may be taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, and that capital gains distributions could vary significantly from year to year due to the funds’ “normal” investment activities and cash flows. However, the prospectuses did not disclose the potential for increased capital gains distributions resulting from the redemptions of fund shares by newly eligible investors switching from the Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs. The SEC order also found that Vanguard failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures to prevent violations related to the accuracy of the funds’ disclosures. Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit, emphasized the importance of accurate information about capital gains and tax implications for investors saving for their retirements. He stated that firms must ensure that they accurately describe to investors the potential risks and consequences associated with their investments. The settlement resolves the SEC’s investigation and parallel investigations of Vanguard announced today by the Office of the New York Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Banking, and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General on behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association. The SEC’s order finds that Vanguard violated the Advisers Act and caused violations of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. Vanguard has agreed to be censured, cease and desist from future violations, and pay $18.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This payment will be deemed satisfied by the payment of $92.91 million in relief ordered by the states’ settlements and a $13.5 million civil penalty, for a total amount of $106.41 million to be distributed to affected investors through a Fair Fund. This amount is in addition to $40 million that Vanguard agreed to pay to settle an investor class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. If this settlement is terminated or rejected, the $40 million will be added to the Fair Fund. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Time Published: 2025-01-17T17:02:01Z
Full Content:
It’s becoming more and more difficult for Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s newly red-pilled CEO, to claim the rightward shift at his company reflects business as usual. According to a new report in The New York Times, Trump ally and surrogate Stephen Miller told Zuckerberg in December that the president-elect planned to go to war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the Meta chief has now axed just ahead of Trump taking office. At the same Mar-a-Lago meeting, the Times reported, Zuckerberg blamed Meta’s progressive culture on his “close friend” and former colleague, Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg reportedly “signaled” to Miller and other senior Trump advisers “that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda,” according to the Times, and that in the coming months, his company would “focus solely on building tech products.” And as part of that shift, Zuckerberg reportedly added, Meta would soon announce layoffs and additional guidelines to “reset” the company’s culture. (Miller and Meta officials declined to comment to the Times.) All of those things have since come to pass, less than two months after Zuckerberg and Miller’s tête-à-tête. In addition to killing its DEI program—a move the company blamed on the shifting “policy landscape” in the US—Zuckerberg has downsized Meta’s moderation efforts, cancelled a nine-year fact-checking project and railed against the “neutering” of corporate culture on Joe Rogan’s podcast. On Wednesday, Meta also announced plans to cut five percent of its workforce, or roughly 3,600 people, though it’s not yet clear which teams will be impacted. The company’s long-time global policy chief, Nick Clegg, has already departed. The Times’ reporting sheds further light on Meta’s MAGAfication—and the larger, political realignment taking place inside Big Tech. While Silicon Valley has long served as a reliable stronghold for Democrats, many of its foremost leaders have lately cozied up to Trump and his administration. In addition to Zuckerberg, at least half a dozen prominent tech CEOs—including Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman—will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, Axios reported. They join Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who will sit on the inaugural dais alongside the Trump family, Elon Musk and a host of other notables. Tech executives do potentially have much to gain from a friendship with Trump: During his first term, the president-elect showed apparent preference for companies that aligned with him. His deregulatory agenda could also benefit US tech firms, which chafed under departing President Joe Biden’s approach to antitrust law, artificial intelligence and the taxation of the ultrarich. In his farewell address on Wednesday, Biden warned about the rise of “a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers” to society. “Today,” Biden said, “an oligarchy is taking shape in America … that literally threatens our entire democracy.” Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires Donald Trump’s First Orders of Business Infighting.

Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker
URL: https://qz.com/intel-stock-rise-acquisition-ai-chips-gelsinger-1851741975
Time Published: 2025-01-17T17:02:00Z
Full Content:
Intel’s (INTC+1.63%) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.91%), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-0.55%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-0.25%) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO-0.62%) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

Title: US stocks notch first weekly gain this year before Trump's inauguration, executive orders

Wall Street closed higher on Friday, pushing stocks to their first weekly advance this year, ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. President-elect Trump's inauguration is Monday, and his first days are expected to be filled with a flurry of executive orders. "Reports suggest 100 or more," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. Any signals of how Trump's proposed tariffs would be implemented would be carefully watched, they said. Morgan Stanley economists still think the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates at its March policy meeting after cooler inflation data earlier this week, but noted "sooner and higher-than-expected tariffs can take March off of the table." Bitcoin gained 4.95%, closing in on $105,000, in anticipation of a possible first day order by Trump. It was last at $104,949 on reports that Trump could release an executive order making crypto a national priority as soon as his new term begins. Crypto-related shares like Coinbase and Robinhood rose, too." The broad S&P 500 index closed up 1% at 5,996.71; the blue-chip Dow gained 0,77%, rising to 43,487.52; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.51% to 19,630.20. Shares of social media giants Facebook and Instagram owner Meta and YouTube parent Alphabet advanced after the Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell it. Trump reportedly is considering an executive order to stop the ban. Meanwhile, Meta and Alphabet closed higher because they may be among the companies that could benefit from a TikTok ban, analysts said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield firmed to 4.615%. U.S. stocks notched their first weekly gain this year, with the S&P 500 and Dow logging their biggest weekly gains since November. The Nasdaq put in its best week since December. "The U.S. macro backdrop at the moment, at least per December’s data, is one that points to the ‘best of all worlds’ – higher employment, falling core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors), and a strong consumer," said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, which offers trading services. "Not a bad inheritance for President-elect Trump to pick up on Monday." On Friday morning, December industrial production and capacity utilization both easily beat expectations. Industrial production, which measures factory output, rose 0.9% and capacity utilization, which measures how efficiently resources are used, improved to 77.6%. On a technical basis, stocks also look bullish, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. So-called sentiment indicators -- bullish or bearish -- at extreme levels are "fairly reliable contrarian indicators," Tentarelli said, and bullish sentiment for stocks currently is at the lowest level since the November 2023 major S&P 500 lows in November 2023. This should bode well for stocks, he said. "Investors tend to be most bullish at market highs and most bearish near market lows," he said. Corporate news continues to garner attention.

Title: Goldman Sachs boosts David Solomon's pay 25% — and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO

Goldman Sachs (GS-0.25%) is locking in CEO David Solomon for at least another five years with a sweet stock deal — along with a big, annual pay increase. The investment bank is offering Solomon 130,508 restricted stock units, valued at $80 million, with a five-year vesting period, Goldman disclosed in a regulatory filing dated Thursday. President and chief operating officer John Waldron — considered Solomon’s leading successor — received the same retention package. These so-called retention grants or RSUs are a sign that the firm plans to hold onto their executives, at least for the duration of the vesting period. That’s on top of the $39 million total compensation package given to Solomon for 2024, up a hefty 25.8% from $31 million in 2023. That puts Solomon’s pay up there with leaders at other top banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.59%) CEO Jamie Dimon, who received a $36 million compensation package in 2023, and former Morgan Stanley (MS-0.55%) CEO James Gorman, who made $37 million in his last year with the firm. Other Wall Street banks have not yet disclosed their CEO compensation for the 2024 fiscal year. Goldman attributed the pay bump to the firm’s strong performance last year, including a “significant year-over-year improvement as a result of strategic execution.” The firm also pointed to a “48% increase in stock price, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and 7% book value per share growth, resulting in record amount of capital returned to common shareholders in 2024.” Goldman reported Wednesday that it saw $13.87 billion in net revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 23% year-over-year jump. Profit more than doubled to $4.11 billion, for the fourth quarter, from $2.01 billion a year ago. For the full year, Goldman brought in net revenues of $53.51 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: More Tech Pink Slips: Microsoft Lays Off Employees from Multiple Divisions Including Gaming

Microsoft has reportedly begun laying off employees in several key divisions, including security, sales, gaming, and devices. Business Insider reports that Microsoft, the tech giant known for its increasingly common security breaches and intimate relationship with China, is undergoing a round of layoffs that span multiple departments within the company. According to two people familiar with the matter, the job cuts are impacting teams in the security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs were small in scale but did not provide specific numbers. The spokesperson also emphasized that these layoffs are separate from the recent job cuts targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft has been placing a strong emphasis on security in recent years, particularly after facing a series of security issues, including what the Department of Homeland Security described as “a cascade of security failures” that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. In response, the company expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for all employees. The initiative was reinforced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an email to employees, stating, “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security.” The layoffs in the security division raise questions about the company’s ongoing commitment to prioritizing security and addressing past vulnerabilities. It remains to be seen how these job cuts will impact Microsoft’s overall security strategy and its ability to deliver on the promises made through the Secure Future Initiative. In addition to the security team, the layoffs are also affecting employees in the experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. These departments play crucial roles in Microsoft’s product development, customer relationships, and entertainment offerings. The extent of the impact on these teams and the specific roles affected have not been disclosed. Read more at Business Insider here.

Title: Amazon to lay off 200 people in its North America retail operations

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said it is cutting a small number of roles after a routine evaluation of its team structures and ability to “move fast.” Amazon has eliminated roles across its retail team in North America, impacting about 200 people in both physical store and e-commerce operations, the company confirmed Thursday. The cuts are being made as part of the company’s regular evaluation of its team structures “to ensure we’re best set up to move fast as we innovate for customers,” according to an Amazon spokesperson. “We’ve adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities,” the spokesperson said by email. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” This downsizing is unrelated to Amazon’s decision to end its Try Before You Buy program, a service that allows a trial period for certain apparel, footwear and accessories. In that case, the company said that more people are increasingly using tech that allows them to get a sense of how items fit before they place an order. Last year the e-commerce giant also announced layoffs in its retail division. In January 2024 that included several hundred roles in its Alexa team and several others in its Buy With Prime team. The previous year the company announced more substantial job cuts, also mostly in retail. Overall in the industry, job cuts spiked last month, although retailers are also still hiring, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Title: LVMH's Bernard Arnault ousts Larry Ellison as the world's 4th-richest person after gaining $15 billion in one day

A fashion mogul has gained more wealth this year than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or anyone else on the global rich list. Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has become about $14 billion richer already in 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He leapfrogged Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison on Thursday to take fourth place on Bloomberg's rich list with an estimated $190 billion fortune, adding $15 billion to his net worth in just one day. The luxury tycoon has gained more wealth this year than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was up nearly $12 billion at Thursday's market close, and the "Donald of Dubai" Hussain Sajwani, up around $10 billion. Zuckerberg and Musk are the next-biggest gainers. The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively. Arnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. The shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont — the owner of brands like Cartier and Chloé — reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa. Consumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers. Arnault, nicknamed the "Wolf in Cashmere," was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion. Even accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion. The group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.

Title: What's In Store For Merck Stock In 2025?

CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American multinational pharmaceutical company ... [+] Merck (NYSE: MRK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Merck stock (NYSE: MRK) lost about 10% in 2024, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which gained 23% for the year. Despite strong performances from other pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly stock (up 31%) and AbbVie stock(up 15%), Merck’s stock performance has been muted. This is attributed to declining sales of its blockbuster HPV vaccine – Gardasil – and an increased competition for some of its drugs, including Januvia. As an aside, new gaming products can be impactful. See Will New Switch Give A Boost To Nintendo Stock? In this note, while we briefly touch upon Merck’s performance in 2024, we focus on the impact on MRK stock and how 2025 could turn out. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Three trends were clearly visible for Merck in 2024. Firstly, the cash cow – Keytruda – continued to gain market share with approval in more indications. Keytruda’s last twelve-month sales now stand at a whopping $28 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2023. Secondly, the next best-selling product – Gardasil – faced headwinds in China, resulting in its sales falling in the recent quarters. The last-twelve month period sales of $9 billion align with the figure reported in 2023. This comes after a stellar 31.5% annual average growth rate Gardasil posted in the last three years. A crackdown on the healthcare industry in China has impacted on the overall vaccination rate in China. Lastly, it saw an improvement in gross margins, thanks to lower royalty rates for Keytruda and Gardasil. 2024 was also the year where Merck looked at inorganic growth to expand its pharmaceuticals and animal health business. It acquired Elanco’s aqua business for $1.3 billion, Harpoon Therapeutics for $680 million, LaNova Medicines for $588 million, Curon for $750 million, and EyeBio for $1.3 billion, among others. Merck may continue to eye inorganic growth to combat with the fall in sales, when Keytruda sees biosimilar competition (likely in 2029). It will be a massive gap to bridge, given that Keytruda is one of the top-selling drugs globally. MRK stock declined gradually from levels of $110 in early January last year to $99 by the end of 2024. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in MRK stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 1% in 2023, and -6% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Merck’s Valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 30% upside from its current market price of $100. At its current levels, MRK stock is trading at 4x trailing revenues, compared to the stock’s average P/S ratio of 4.5x over the last three years. 2025 is likely going to be better for Merck. Keytruda is expected to continue to lead the growth, with its approval for more indications lately. However, Gardasil’s decline in China may continue to weigh on the company’s vaccine sales in 2025. Merck’s diabetes drugs – Januvia and Janumet – are likely to see increased competition. The company’s animal health business is likely to benefit from increased pet ownership in the U.S. We expect the company to maintain its higher gross margins on the back of better product mix. Merck may also secure the regulatory approval for clesrovimab – an antibody for RSV treatment in infants. If approved, clesrovimab has the potential to garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. The U.S. FDA has set a deadline of June 10 to make a decision on approval of clesrovimab. Overall, MRK stock looks like it will have more positives to aid it in 2025. With its stock trading at 4x trailing revenues, we think the potential headwinds for Gardasil are largely priced in. While MRK stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Merck’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. But whether it's "rightsizing," "streamlining," or Meta's recent buzzphrase "nonregrettable attrition," the corporate lingo of job cuts doesn't soften the blow to employees. 2. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming $400 million in damages. The "It Ends With Us" director filed a 179-page suit on Thursday, accusing his costar of hijacking the movie and destroying his reputation. Lively previously accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and of trying to smear her in the press, claims that Baldoni has denied. 3. All the lonely (young) people. Gen Z adults are the loneliest and least optimistic generation, a new survey found. It's not just about young Americans having fewer social connections. More time alone and young people getting married later are also factors. Boomers, on the other hand, are on a different wavelength. The 10 safest states to live in the US, ranked.

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. But whether it's "rightsizing," "streamlining," or Meta's recent buzzphrase "nonregrettable attrition," the corporate lingo of job cuts doesn't soften the blow to employees. 2. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming $400 million in damages. The "It Ends With Us" director filed a 179-page suit on Thursday, accusing his costar of hijacking the movie and destroying his reputation. Lively previously accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and of trying to smear her in the press, claims that Baldoni has denied. 3. All the lonely (young) people. Gen Z adults are the loneliest and least optimistic generation, a new survey found. It's not just about young Americans having fewer social connections. More time alone and young people getting married later are also factors. Boomers, on the other hand, are on a different wavelength. The 10 safest states to live in the US, ranked.

Title: Ozempic could get cheaper as Medicare eyes drug price negotiations — and Novo Nordisk stock slips

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said Friday that it had selected another 15 drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including the popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Negotiations between the federal government and drugmakers are slated to occur in 2025, with any new prices set to take effect in 2027. Pharmaceutical companies have until Feb. 25 to decide if they will participate in negotiations. Along with Wegovy and Ozempic, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has tapped Xtandi, Ibrance, Calquence, and Pomalyst, which are used to treat various types of cancer, for price negotiations. Otezla, a psoriasis medicine; Vraylar, an antipsychotic.; and Trelegy Ellipta, an inhaler used to treat emphysema and asthma, were also picked. According to the CMS, the drugs selected were used by 5.3 million people with coverage under Medicare Part D between November 2023 and October 2024 to treat conditions such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. They also accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered under Medicare Part D, or about 14% of all costs, during that time period. “Last year, we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,” Xavier Becerra, the outgoing head of HHS, said in a statement. “Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.” The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed the CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. HHS in August announced lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%.

Its drugs have become incredibly popular as Americans turn to GLP-1 medications to help them lose weight. Wegovy has also been approved for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes, while studies have found these dugs can help with several other conditions. Novo Nordisk saw its stock fall by more than 4% in pre-market trading Friday. Shares are also being affected by headline results from a new study that found patients who take a higher dose of Wegovy lost more weight than those on a lower dose without experiencing an increase in side effects. The study found that people who took a 7.2-milligram dose lost an average of 20.7% of their weight over 72 weeks. Patients who took a 2.4-milligram dose of the semaglutide lost 17.5% of their weight, while people given a placebo lost just 2.4% of their weight over that time. Over 33% of participants who took the higher dose also recorded a weight loss of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% of participants with the lower dose. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” Novo Nordisk’s head of development, Martin Holst Lange, said in a statement. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

January 17, 2025 07:11 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 17 January 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from STEP UP, a phase 3b trial in the global STEP programme. STEP UP is a 72-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once weekly. The trial included 1,407 randomised adults with obesity. All treatment arms were in conjunction with lifestyle intervention. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 72 with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 113 kg, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 20.7% after 72 weeks compared to a reduction of 17.5% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.4% with placebo. In addition, 33.2% of those who received semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a weight loss of 25% or more after 72 weeks, compared to 16.7% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 0.0% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 18.7% compared to a reduction of 15.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo. In the trial, semaglutide 7.2 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “Results from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy®, including cardiovascular risk reduction as seen in SELECT”. The results from the second semaglutide 7.2 mg phase 3 trial, STEP UP T2D, in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity are expected within the next few months. Detailed results from the STEP UP trial are expected to be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the STEP UP trialsNovo Nordisk has initiated two trials investigating the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2mg, STEP UP and STEP UP T2D. The 72-week STEP UP trial was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 1,407 adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and without diabetes were included in the trial. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. Key secondary endpoints included number of participants achieving 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% weight loss, respectively. The ongoing 72-week STEP UP T2D trial will investigate semaglutide 7.2 mg in 512 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with the primary objective to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg)Semaglutide 2.4 mg is marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. In the EU, Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition. In the EU, Wegovy® is also indicated for paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity) and body weight above 60 kg. The clinical section of the label also includes data showing the benefits of Wegovy® in reducing the risk of MACE, improving HFpEF-related symptoms and physical function, as well as reducing pain related to knee osteoarthritis. In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Title: The Power Of Leadership Magnetism: A Key Driver Of Stock Performance

Louis Carter: CEO of Best Practice Institute, creator of Most Loved Workplace®, author of Change Champions & In Great Company (McGraw Hill). When discussing drivers of stock performance, many factors come to mind—market conditions, financial performance and strategic communications, among others. However, even the most compelling good news doesn't always translate to stock price increases. A crucial yet often overlooked factor is what I call "leadership magnetism": the ability of a leader to build trust, emotional alignment and shared purpose with their stakeholders. Leadership magnetism refers to the gravitational pull a leader creates through their actions, behaviors and communications. It isn't about charisma or personality—it's about building authentic connections that attract, align and inspire stakeholders, from employees to investors. Leaders with strong magnetism can amplify the impact of strategic announcements, driving enthusiasm and financial returns. When leadership magnetism is weak, however, even breakthrough announcements can fail to move markets, as eroded trust dampens investor response. Research underscores the value of leadership magnetism in organizational success. A Weber Shandwick study found that executives attribute 44% of a company's market value to the CEO's reputation. Similarly, back in 2000, a Burson-Marsteller study revealed that 45% of a company's reputation directly stems from its CEO’s standing. These findings highlight how a leader’s ability to connect emotionally and strategically with stakeholders significantly influences market outcomes. Several notable cases demonstrate how weak leadership magnetism can undermine even the most promising strategic initiatives: • WeWork's Trajectory Under Adam Neumann: Despite announcing ambitious expansion plans in 2019, WeWork's valuation plummeted from $47 billion to less than $8 billion (subscription required). As documented by the Wall Street Journal, stakeholders lost confidence in Adam Neumann's leadership due to concerns about his decision-making and governance style. Bloomberg similarly detailed how mounting concerns about Neumann's transparency eroded investor confidence​ • Meta And Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse Investment: In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced a $10 billion investment in the metaverse alongside a company rebranding. However, Meta's stock price dropped, as ongoing privacy issues and ethical controversies diminished his leadership magnetism. • GE's Strategic Pivot Under Jeff Immelt: Between 2015 and 2017, GE's stock price declined from $30.66 to $23.16 as stakeholders questioned Jeff Immelt's ability to execute a digital transformation strategy. CEOs who master leadership magnetism can transform strategic announcements into powerful market catalysts: • Microsoft And Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella’s clear vision for AI-driven growth has been instrumental in Microsoft’s financial success. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft reported in 2024 "over $245 billion in annual revenue, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, alongside a 24% jump in operating income to over $109 billion." These achievements underscore Nadella’s ability to inspire confidence and effectively communicate strategic priorities. • Tesla And Elon Musk: Elon Musk’s ability to rally stakeholders around Tesla’s mission "to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy" exemplifies leadership magnetism. Musk’s authenticity and mission-driven strategy have been credited as key factors in Tesla’s rise to market dominance, inspiring investor confidence and stakeholder loyalty (membership required). After two and a half decades working alongside, coaching and advising CEOs, I've observed three fundamental practices that build and sustain leadership magnetism: Leadership magnetism thrives when leaders tune into their organization's pulse, strengthen it and then move on it. Magnetic leaders have an innate sense of when to listen and when to move—gathering key insights swiftly, recognizing patterns that matter and then driving consistent messages that reflect shared aspirations. Take Satya Nadella, whose leadership at Microsoft exemplifies this approach, bringing teams into the vision-building process and ensuring alignment and commitment. Magnetic leaders use stakeholder feedback as their strategic radar, not a compliance exercise. Lisa Su of AMD demonstrates this perfectly: She consistently gathers input from employees and retail investors, using it to refine AMD's strategy and foster loyalty. Elon Musk has a rare quality among CEOs: He doesn't sugarcoat things, even in tough moments. Take his 2014 interview where he opened up about Tesla's early days. Instead of spinning a success story, he admitted what was really going through his head at the time: "I thought we would most likely fail." You don't often hear billionaire founders talk about doubt like that. It's this kind of raw honesty, especially when the stakes are high, that sets his leadership style apart. Leadership magnetism is not a fixed trait—it’s a skill that can be cultivated through intentional practices. By fostering collaboration, integrating feedback and acting authentically, leaders can create a magnetic pull that inspires, aligns and drives success. As markets grow more complex and stakeholder expectations evolve, leadership magnetism will become increasingly crucial. Tomorrow's successful leaders must master the delicate balance between strategic vision and authentic connection, technical excellence and emotional intelligence, bold action and stakeholder trust. The revolution in leadership valuation is already underway. Good news alone won't drive stock price increases if stakeholders don't trust or admire the CEO. Those who embrace the power of leadership magnetism will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of market dynamics.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks

Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

Title: Microsoft’s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge

(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NY’s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark The worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday. Top Tech Stories TikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX’s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle’s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday. Top Tech Stories TikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX’s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle’s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.
